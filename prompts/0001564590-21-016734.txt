Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and other chronic liver diseases. Our programs are based on clinically-validated and complementary mechanisms of action to address the multiple hepatic disease processes of NASH in order to drive meaningful clinical benefits for patients. The mechanisms of action targeted by our current drug candidates are the same mechanisms of action targeted by other drug candidates that have achieved clinical proof-of-concept in NASH clinical trials and have demonstrated significant improvements on histological and non-invasive markers of the disease, though no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. Our most advanced program is TERN-101, a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple Phase 1 clinical trials. In our Phase 1 clinical trials, no pruritus, or itching, or increases in LDL cholesterol levels as compared to the control group were observed—unlike in Phase 1 clinical trials of other FXR agonists conducted by third parties. Our Phase 2a clinical trial of TERN-101 in NASH patients (the LIFT Study) was fully enrolled in January 2021 and we expect top-line data in July 2021. Our second clinical stage program, TERN-201, is a highly selective inhibitor of Vascular Adhesion Protein-1. We intend to start our Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in the first half of 2021 and expect top-line data in the first half of 2022. Our third clinical stage program is TERN-501, a Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our investigational new drug application, or IND, for TERN-501. In March 2021, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-501 and we expect top-line data in the second half of 2021. We are also pursuing two combination therapy programs to address the multiple disease processes of NASH and expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial evaluating a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022. 
 NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, that affects up to 15 million people in the United States, and up to 6% of the global population, for which there is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2016, direct healthcare costs associated with NAFLD and NASH in the United States in 2016 were estimated to be approximately $100 billion, in the absence of approved therapies. Severe progression of NASH can lead to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and increased risk for hepatic carcinoma and liver-related mortality. NASH is a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our pipeline of programs is intended to address each of these distinct pathogenic disease processes. We believe that with our pipeline targeting steatosis (TERN-101 and TERN-501), inflammation (TERN-101 and TERN-201) and fibrosis (TERN-101 and TERN-201) in tandem, our programs have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvements in related clinical outcomes. Furthermore, by developing combination therapies to treat NASH, we are aiming to expand the reach of NASH therapeutics through improved response rates, better tolerability and improved compliance as compared to monotherapy regimens.

Our NASH Pipeline Programs 
 Our wholly owned NASH pipeline includes multiple single-agent and combination therapy candidates that provide several opportunities to address the multifaceted nature of NASH and drive meaningful clinical benefits for patients. We intend to advance single-agent and combination therapy candidates to increase the potential for improved response rates in NASH patients, for whom there are no approved treatment options. 

• | TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor, or FXR, agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These safety and tolerability issues have been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials for other FXR agonists and have generally been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. However, in all four Phase 1 clinical trials of TERN-101, none of the 119 subjects who received TERN-101 reported pruritus, and the serum lipid profiles among TERN-101 recipients were similar to placebo recipients at all doses. We are currently evaluating TERN-101 in a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial in approximately 100 NASH patients (the LIFT Study). In January 2021, we completed the enrollment of patients into the LIFT Study and top-line data is expected in July 2021. We received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.

• | TERN-201 is a highly-selective inhibitor of Vascular Adhesion Protein-1, or VAP-1, that has demonstrated sustained target engagement in clinical trials without the off-target liabilities associated with other VAP-1 inhibitors in development. VAP-1 facilitates the deceleration, binding, and transmigration of leukocytes from the bloodstream into the liver and produces reactive oxygen species that promote liver inflammation and fibrosis. VAP-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of NASH patients in response to local lipotoxicity and liver injury. In a Phase 2a clinical trial of another developer’s VAP-1 inhibitor in NASH patients, 12 weeks of administration demonstrated significant, dose-dependent improvements in NASH biomarkers, providing clinical proof of concept for VAP-1 inhibition in NASH. In our Phase 1a first-in-human (SAD/MAD) clinical trial in 61 healthy subjects, TERN-201 was shown to fully suppress plasma VAP-1 activity at all of the doses we evaluated. TERN-201 was selected for development over other discovery candidates because it is highly specific for VAP-1 inhibition and has minimal potential for off-target effects. We intend to start our Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in the first half of 2021 and expect top-line data in the first half of 2022. We received Fast

• | TERN-501 is a Thyroid Hormone Receptor beta, or THR-β, agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. Agonism of THR-β increases fatty acid metabolism via mitochondrial oxidation and affects cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. As a result, THR-β stimulation has the ability to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve serum lipid parameters including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In vivo NASH studies in a rodent model have demonstrated that low-doses of TERN-501 achieved complete resolution of steatosis and reductions in serum lipids, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. TERN-501 has high liver distribution and is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity and other off-target effects associated with non-selective THR stimulation. Finally, TERN-501 has been designed to be metabolically stable and is therefore expected to have little pharmacokinetic variability and a low clinical dose, making it an attractive candidate for use in fixed-dose combinations for NASH treatment. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for TERN-501. In March 2021, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-501 and we expect top-line data in the second half of 2021.

• | GLP-1R is our small-molecule Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor agonist program that is intended to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of NASH. Our GLP-1R program has identified several potentially suitable small-molecule scaffolds. We plan to further optimize these series of compounds and identify structures that are suitable for orally administered combination with other NASH drug candidates within our pipeline. We are currently advancing this program through lead optimization and anticipate announcing a development candidate in the second half of 2021.

Combinations: 
 Several prior clinical trials evaluating single-agent therapies for NASH have shown only moderate histological improvements and exhibited tolerability issues with some of these agents at high doses. We believe that developing combination therapies targeting multiple mechanistic pathways will drive improved response rates for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are well-positioned to develop multiple combination therapies for NASH with our extensive experience in combination drug development and the ability to leverage our pipeline of wholly owned single-agents that we believe are suitable for orally administered combination development. 
 We believe that therapies targeting steatosis (TERN-101 and TERN-501), inflammation (TERN-101 and TERN-201) and fibrosis (TERN-101 and TERN-201) in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical outcomes. We expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial evaluating a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients in the first half of 2022. We are also assessing the potential utility of combinations of TERN-201 with assets inside and outside of our pipeline. Given the strength of our internal resources and capabilities, we have the flexibility to independently advance our combination therapies without the need for a co-development partner at this time. 
 Our History 
 Terns was founded in 2017 with the goal of developing innovative therapies for patients with NASH and other liver diseases. We have assembled a team of industry veterans with extensive experience in drug discovery and development, especially in liver diseases. Collectively, our team is responsible for more than 20 FDA approved products, including eleven fixed-dose-combination drugs. Our executive team has a strong track record in leading successful biotechnology companies and research and development organizations. Senthil Sundaram, our Chief Executive Officer, has over 20 years of strategy, financial and leadership experience in the life sciences industry.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize differentiated monotherapies and combination therapies for patients with NASH and other chronic liver diseases. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 

• | Develop improved drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action. We are developing a portfolio of small molecule drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action for the treatment of NASH. The mechanisms of action targeted by our current drug candidates are the same mechanisms of action targeted by other drug candidates that have achieved clinical proof-of-concept in NASH clinical trials and have demonstrated significant improvements on histological and non-invasive markers of the disease, though no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. However, these clinical trials have also highlighted an opportunity for us to meaningfully improve the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies utilizing these mechanisms. Based on this premise, we are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in a high proportion of NASH patients as either single-agent or combination therapies.

• | Leverage non-invasive biomarkers to rapidly advance our single-agent drug candidates through clinical proof-of-concept. We are advancing our single-agent drug candidates through clinical proof-of-concept trials on an expedited basis by using relevant non-invasive biomarkers in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to efficiently confirm and benchmark target engagement or efficacy without the need for liver biopsies. We believe this approach enables us to accelerate enrollment in our clinical trials and achieve significantly shorter development timelines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our portfolio of combination therapy candidates for the treatment of NASH. In addition to developing our single-agent drug candidates, we are evaluating and developing fixed-dose combination therapies to address the multiple disease processes of NASH. We believe developing combination therapies targeting multiple mechanistic pathways will drive improved response rates for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. The outcomes of our monotherapy biomarker-based clinical trials will further inform our decision to pursue the utility of our drug candidates as monotherapies or in fixed-dose-combinations that we believe have synergistic therapeutic effect and well-balanced safety profiles. We have identified and are advancing our first combination therapy candidate for NASH, involving a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501, and expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial in the first half of 2022. We are also evaluating the potential to co-administer TERN-201, a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent, in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment.

• | Advance our earlier stage program and expand applications for our existing drug candidates. We have identified a series of GLP-1R small molecule agonists with the potential to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of NASH. Our GLP-1R program is designed to enable oral administration, a limitation of existing GLP-1 agonists, for widespread use in NASH patients. We are currently advancing this program through lead optimization and anticipate announcing a development candidate in the second half of 2021. Beyond NASH, our goal is to maximize the commercial potential of our existing drug candidates by exploring additional indications supported by their underlying biology and mechanism. For example, we believe our NASH drug candidates may also have utility in other chronic liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. We will maintain a focused and disciplined strategy in evaluating potential follow-on indications that may merit further advancement.

• | Independently develop and commercialize our drug candidates in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize the value and benefit to patients. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those drug candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on drug candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas, patient populations or geographies that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies.

Background on NASH 
 NASH is a severe form of NAFLD, a common liver disease characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver (steatosis). When hepatic steatosis results in liver inflammation and, in many cases, fibrosis, it results in NASH, a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Severe progression of NASH leads to cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease, with the associated risks for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. NASH was recently identified as the second leading etiologic indication for liver transplantation in the United States, and it is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the coming years. 
 NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, affecting 80 to 100 million individuals. Among persons with NAFLD, approximately 20% will progress to NASH, which is currently estimated to affect 15 million adults in the United States. Progression of liver fibrosis ultimately leads to cirrhosis in an estimated 20% of patients with NASH. With an aging population and the markedly increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia/metabolic syndrome worldwide, NAFLD and NASH have increased greatly in prevalence, posing a significant healthcare challenge. In a study published in Hepatology in 2016, direct healthcare costs associated with NAFLD and NASH in the United States in 2016 were estimated to be approximately $100 billion, in the absence of approved therapies. 
 Etiology of NASH 
 NAFLD and NASH are classified as progressive metabolic diseases, often correlated with chronic excess caloric intake, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Physiologically, hepatocytes in the liver can act as a repository for excess energy stored by the body. As humans consume disproportionate amounts of calories relative to those burned on a consistent basis, the body becomes overweight, and organs, including the liver, become burdened by fatty tissue. With the liver acting as the hub for excess energy and energy conversion, an imbalance develops with more delivery of fats and triglycerides to the liver, an increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis, and impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation and removal of liver fat, resulting in NAFLD. 
 Within the steatotic liver, fat deposits can create lipotoxic effects to the surrounding liver tissue, resulting in hepatocyte stress and injury and activating inflammatory Kupffer cells. Local increases in reactive oxygenation species can induce hepatocytes to undergo cell death and create an inflammatory response within the organ. VAP-1 is over expressed in affected areas of the liver, serving as an attachment point for inflammatory leukocytes and triggering their recruitment from the bloodstream into the liver. These leukocytes are stimulated by local lipotoxic effects and the presence of reactive oxygenation species to produce cytokines, further exacerbating local inflammatory cascades and activating resident Kupffer cells, thereby exacerbating local inflammation. 
 Inflammatory cascades in the liver activate hepatic stellate cells to excrete extracellular matrix resulting in liver fibrosis. Over time, fibrosis progresses, increasingly replacing diseased and normal liver tissue with scar tissue. Eventually, most of the liver is replaced by fibrotic tissue, which histologically is categorized as cirrhosis. While some cirrhotic patients have enough functional liver tissue to maintain hepatic activity, over time, the liver fails, resulting in decompensated liver disease and the need for liver transplantation to avoid liver related death. Furthermore, cirrhosis is a key risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
 NASH is currently diagnosed by histological findings on liver biopsy. In clinical trials, recommended scoring systems assess (i) liver fibrosis and (ii) steatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD Activity Score, or NAS, a composite score that grades the degree of three non-fibrotic histologic features of NASH: steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation. Efficacious responses to treatment in NASH clinical trials are usually considered to be either an improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of the NAS, or an improvement of the NAS without worsening of fibrosis. 
 Increasingly, non-invasive blood and imaging tests are being used in clinical practice to diagnose NASH. Vibration controlled transient elastography combined with blood tests (serum chemistries, hematological parameters and other biomarkers) have shown good accuracy in diagnosing both steatosis and the degree of liver inflammation. As data from these non-invasive assessments continue to accumulate—for initial diagnosis of NASH, monitoring of disease progression over time, and monitoring response to treatment—these approaches may replace liver biopsy, both in clinical practice and clinical trials. In its December 2018 draft NASH guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to include non-invasive biomarkers in clinical studies of experimental NASH treatments in order to accelerate development and supplant liver biopsy.

Treatment of NASH 
 There currently are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of NASH, and available treatment options are limited to control of metabolic dysfunction, including weight loss, as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes. However, many patients are unable to achieve or maintain significant weight loss or comply long-term with the dietary and lifestyle changes required to reverse NASH. In order to optimally treat NASH and reduce the risk of liver cancer and liver-related mortality, the three distinct disease processes may each need to be addressed–steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Single agents focusing on specific mechanisms contributing to one of these three processes, each involving multiple pathways, have demonstrated only modest results to date. 
 The following table summarizes some of the treatment approaches for NASH currently in clinical development, together with limitations observed and Terns’ differentiated approach. Among the small-molecule programs with validated mechanisms, we believe FXR agonism, VAP-1 inhibition and THR-β agonism have great potential, not only as targets for single-agent therapy, but also as key components in combination therapies.

Our Programs 
 We are developing a portfolio of small molecules that address the multiple hepatic disease processes of NASH in order to drive meaningful clinical benefits. Our most advanced program, TERN-101, is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple Phase 1 clinical trials. Our Phase 2a clinical trial of TERN-101 in NASH was fully enrolled in January 2021 and we expect top-line data in July 2021. Our second clinical stage program, TERN-201, is a highly selective inhibitor of VAP-1, which directly addresses hepatic inflammation. We intend to start our Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in the first half of 2021 and expect top-line data in the first half of 2022. Our third clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for TERN-501 and we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-501 in March 2021. We expect top-line data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2021. We are also pursuing two

combination therapy programs to address the multiple disease processes of NASH and expect to initiate a Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept trial evaluating a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in the first half of 2022. We believe developing combination therapies targeting multiple mechanistic pathways will drive improved response rates across the population of NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns associated with other drugs in development. 
 TERN-101—a liver-distributed FXR agonist 
 Drug candidate summary 
 TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement; likely due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These tolerability issues have generally been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials of other FXR agonists in development and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. However, in all four Phase 1 clinical trials of TERN-101, none of the 119 subjects who received TERN-101 reported pruritus, and the serum lipid profiles among TERN-101 recipients were similar to placebo recipients even at high doses. We are currently evaluating TERN-101 in a Phase 2a, 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in approximately 100 NASH patients (the LIFT Study), which was fully enrolled in January 2021, and we expect top-line data in July 2021. Our investigational new drug application, or IND, for TERN-101 went into effect in May 2019. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA. 
 FXR agonists may address NASH in different liver cell types 
 FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. In the hepatocyte, FXR activation induces small heterodimer partner, or SHP, a key metabolic regulator. The upregulation of SHP by FXR reduces the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1C, or SREBP1C, a master regulator of triglyceride synthesis. FXR-mediated inhibition of SREBP1C and subsequent reduction in triglyceride levels could result in reduced hepatic steatosis. FXR also plays a role in modulating hepatic inflammation. Activation of FXR in the hepatocyte represses nuclear factor-kB, or NF-kB, via induction of SHP, thereby reducing hepatic inflammation. FXR activation is also directly associated with reduction in hepatic inflammation in Kupffer cells. In hepatic stellate cells, FXR activation reduces fibrogenic markers such collagen type 1 alpha 1, or Col1a1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, or TIMP1. Inhibition of Col1a1 and TIMP1 reduces collagen synthesis and increases the degradation of the extracellular matrix, or ECM, thereby reducing liver fibrosis.

A liver-distributed FXR agonist has the potential to address NASH
by acting on the three key disease processes and cell types


Clinical validation of FXR agonists 
 FXR agonism has been investigated in large-scale clinical trials and has shown clinically relevant improvements in NASH. In these clinical trials, FXR agonists have shown significant histological NASH improvements in fibrosis, as well as improvement in markers of liver function. 
 Limitations of other FXR agonists: pruritus and adverse lipid changes 
 Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These tolerability issues have been observed in early Phase 1 clinical trials for other FXR agonists as shown in the table below and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. However, in all four Phase 1 clinical trials of TERN-101, none of the 119 subjects who received TERN-101 reported pruritus, and the serum lipid profiles among TERN-101 recipients were similar to placebo recipients even at high doses. An FXR agonist that can demonstrate improved liver health with minimal adverse effects would have great potential benefits for NASH patients.

 We believe the liabilities from the other FXR agonists may be due to their activation of FXR outside the liver, particularly in the intestine. FXR activation in intestinal enterocytes results in the secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 19, or FGF19, which has been associated with increased serum low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol in published studies. Pruritus has been observed in clinical studies of other FXR agonists known to activate intestinal FXR. On the other hand, the use of bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine or colesevelam) or ileal bile acid transporter, or IBAT, inhibitors has been demonstrated in several clinical studies to reduce plasma LDL, cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia and also to mitigate pruritus in patients with cholestatic liver disease, potentially through prevention of FXR activation. Therefore, we believe that an FXR agonist with sustained activity in the liver, but only minimal or transient intestinal or other extrahepatic FXR activity, would likely not be associated with pruritus or adverse lipid changes. 
 Our solution: TERN-101, a liver-distributed FXR agonist 
 We believe TERN-101 has been well-tolerated in completed clinical trials to date because of its high liver distribution, thereby minimizing activation of intestinal pathways that may be associated with pruritus and adverse lipid changes. The figure on the left below demonstrates in a preclinical model that administration of TERN-101 results in significantly higher distribution to the liver compared to other FXR agonists. The figure on the right below demonstrates that administration of TERN-101 is also associated with much higher activation of liver-related FXR gene expression, in contrast to intestinally-directed FXR agonists that have greater FXR gene activation in the intestine than in the liver. Studies have demonstrated that there is minimal overlap between liver and intestine FXR binding sites, indicating potentially a high degree of tissue-specific FXR function.

TERN-101 preferentially distributes to liver and induces liver-specific genes 
 

Figure: The information from the figure above (left) represents preclinical data derived from a rat model conducted by Terns (2 mg/kg of TERN-101, cilofexor or tropifexor); and data disclosed in regulatory filings for the 30 mg/kg of OCA. The information from the figure above (right) represents preclinical data derived from a mouse study model of SHP gene expression conducted by Terns after 7 days of dosing with TERN-101 (10 mg/kg), OCA (30 mg/kg) and tropifexor (0.3 mg/kg). SHP functions to inhibit bile acid synthesis. 
 TERN-101 administration demonstrates sustained FXR activation in the liver 
 The liver-distributed profile of TERN-101 has been demonstrated in a Phase 1 clinical trial of the pharmacodynamics of TERN-101 in 36 human subjects. Sustained liver FXR activation in human subjects was demonstrated by dose-dependent decreases in 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, or C4, concentrations that are among the most potent demonstrated with an FXR agonist to date. A decrease in C4 is a surrogate marker for FXR activation in the liver. In contrast to sustained liver FXR activation, repeated administration of TERN-101 over seven days resulted in only a transient increase of FGF19, suggesting transient intestinal FXR activation while the drug is being absorbed. Data from other FXR agonists in development demonstrate a much more sustained increase in FGF19 that persists through repeat administrations, which may indicate that sustained intestinal FXR activation is associated with their underlying tolerability issues.

 TERN-101 administration is not associated with liabilities of other FXR agonists 
 Across four completed Phase 1 clinical trials in 136 subjects, TERN-101 was administered to 119 subjects and was generally well-tolerated with no confirmed dose-related tolerability signals. Adverse events, or AEs, tended to be mild to moderate, with no dose-related increases in AEs. There was no pruritus among the 119 subjects treated with TERN-101, and lipid profiles in the TERN-101 dose groups were similar to placebo across each trial, including single administrations of TERN-101 at dose level of 600mg and repeated administrations at dose levels of 400mg for 14 days. The chart below plots serum LDL cholesterol concentrations from a Phase 1 pharmacodynamic clinical trial in 36 subjects and demonstrates that the lipid profiles are similar for subjects receiving TERN-101 or placebo. In one Phase 1 clinical trial, one subject receiving placebo and two subjects receiving 400 mg TERN-101 experienced elevations in alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, and aspartate transaminase, or AST, up to approximately five times the upper limit of normal. One of the TERN-101 recipients experienced transient transaminase elevations that decreased upon continued dosing through the duration of the trial, while the other TERN-101 recipient discontinued treatment. Transaminase elevations did not exceed 5.2x the upper limit of normal in any subject who received TERN-101, and none of these subjects had concomitant elevations in bilirubin. Transaminases for each of these subjects decreased to baseline at the end of the clinical trial. No transaminase elevations >1.5x upper limit of normal were observed in other TERN-101 clinical trials, including the single ascending dose trial (including doses of 600 mg) and a subsequent repeat dose trial (25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg doses). Therefore, across the four completed Phase 1 clinical trials for TERN-101 it was concluded that the changes from baseline in ALT and AST were similar between TERN-101 and placebo recipients and the transaminase elevations that occurred in one Phase 1 clinical trial were not clinically relevant. ALT and AST elevations did not recur in subsequent trials.

Figure: Changes from baseline (Day -1) in mean LDL. 
 We believe the favorable Phase 1 tolerability profile stems from the fact that TERN-101 is liver-distributed, with limited systemic and intestinal FXR activation that may be associated with the pruritus and adverse lipid changes seen with other FXR agonists. The solid line in the chart below shows the average plasma level on Day 7 of TERN-101 in human subjects administered 150 mg TERN-101 capsules. The dotted line represents projected TERN-101 liver concentration, which was calculated based on the TERN-101 rat tissue distribution study results. Plasma concentrations at this dose generally do not exceed the TERN-101 EC50 throughout the 24 hour dosing period, thereby avoiding the effects of FXR activation outside of the liver, which we believe explains the lower incidence of off-target effects typically associated with other FXR agonists in development. However, liver concentrations of TERN-101 are projected to be much higher than the TERN-101 EC50 throughout the dosing period, which we believe accounts for the potent C4 decreases observed with TERN-101. Together, these data suggest TERN-101 activity will mainly occur in the liver.

  Ongoing Phase 2a Clinical Trial of TERN-101 (LIFT Study) in NASH patients for 12 weeks 
 16


TERN-101 is currently being evaluated in the LIFT Study, a Phase 2a, 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in approximately 100 patients with phenotypic or biopsy-diagnosed NASH, identified either by prior biopsy or clinical diagnosis (liver stiffness measured by transient elastography of 7.6—25 kPa and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) > 300). In January 2021, we completed the enrollment of patients into the LIFT Study and top-line data are expected in July 2021. Clinical trial participants receive once-daily oral administration of placebo or TERN-101 tablet doses of 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg for 12 weeks. TERN-101 plasma concentrations resulting from these tablet doses are expected to fall within a comparable range as the plasma concentrations observed in Phase 1 studies of capsule formulation doses of 25 mg to 150 mg. The primary endpoint is the incidence of adverse events. Key secondary and exploratory outcome measures are percent change from baseline in ALT, change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction assessed by magnetic resonance imaging derived proton density fat fraction, or MRI-PDFF, as well as other biomarkers that have been associated with histologic improvements in NASH patients.

TERN-201 – a highly selective VAP-1 inhibitor 
 Drug candidate summary 
 TERN-201 is a highly selective, irreversible, covalent inhibitor of VAP-1. In our Phase 1a first-in-human (SAD/MAD) clinical trial across 61 healthy subjects, TERN-201 was shown to fully suppress plasma VAP-1 activity at all of the doses that we evaluated and VAP-1 suppression was evident up to days after a single dose. In preclinical studies, TERN-201 reduced fibrosis in a model of liver injury in a dose-dependent manner, with inflammation and fibrosis significantly reduced after treatment. TERN-201 exhibits high selectivity for VAP-1 and enhanced liver distribution. Importantly, TERN-201 does not inhibit human MAO-A and MAO-B, thereby avoiding risks associated with MAO inhibition. We believe the sustained activity of TERN-201, with its VAP-1 selectivity and anticipated low therapeutic dose, make it suitable for coadministration with therapies directed at steatosis and other metabolic processes involved in NASH. We are currently preparing to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in NASH patients in the first half of 2021 and expect top-line data in the first half of 2022. Our IND for TERN-201 went into effect in January 2019. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-201 for the treatment of NASH in August 2020. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA. 
 Overview of VAP-1 biology in NASH 
 As liver damage accumulates in NAFLD and NASH patients, VAP-1 becomes increasingly expressed on the endothelium of blood vessels within the liver. Through its function as a leukocyte adhesion molecule, VAP-1 facilitates the deceleration, binding and transmigration of leukocytes from the blood stream into the liver, and recruits co-functioning proteins to aid in the transmigration process. These leukocytes respond to local liver tissue damage and multiple stimuli, reproducing and releasing cytokines which cause progressive liver inflammation. In addition, 
 17


VAP-1 acts as an enzyme to break down short-chain primary amines in the blood and produce reactive oxygen species, or ROS, aldehyde, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide in the liver, which in turn cause inflammation, hepatic oxidative stress and tissue damage. Together, the cytokine cascades resulting from white blood cell liver penetration and local ROS-mediated oxidative stress and tissue damage stimulate fibrosis, the synthesis of ECM by activating hepatic stellate cells. The following graphic illustrates this process. 
 VAP-1 increases oxidative stress, recruits white blood cells to the liver, increases inflammation and fibrosis 
 

Clinical validation of VAP-1 inhibition in NASH 
 VAP-1 inhibition has the potential to address the inflammatory process in NASH patients. Preclinical data have demonstrated that VAP-1 inhibition improves liver histology and serum biomarkers. VAP-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of NASH patients in response to local lipotoxicity and liver injury. Increased levels of soluble VAP-1 in the plasma is also associated with the presence of NASH, and with increasing liver fibrosis. In a Phase 2a clinical trial, administration of a different VAP-1 inhibitor over 12 weeks in NASH patients demonstrated significant, dose dependent decreases from baseline in ALT, AST, GGT and CK-18, markers of liver injury and inflammation and cell death compared to placebo. Improvements in these markers provide clinical proof-of-concept for VAP-1 inhibition as a treatment approach in NASH. 
 Limitations of other VAP-1 inhibitors in development 
 A clinical trial of another VAP-1 inhibitor in NASH patients demonstrated improvements in markers of liver injury, inflammation and cell death, including significant reductions in ALT. However, other VAP-1 inhibitors currently in development for NASH are associated MAO inhibition due to their lack of specificity for binding VAP-1. Drugs that inhibit MAO create the risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis when administered with commonly prescribed serotonergic drugs and with tyramine-containing foods. Therefore, we believe a VAP-1 inhibitor with improved selectivity for VAP-1 inhibition that lacks the potential to inhibit MAO-A or MAO-B could provide meaningful clinical benefit to NASH patients in reducing inflammation and liver fibrosis without risks related to MAO inhibition. 
 18


Our solution for VAP-1 inhibition: TERN-201 
 TERN-201 was selected over other discovery candidates because it is highly specific for VAP-1 inhibition and has minimal potential to inhibit MAO-A or MAO-B at clinically relevant concentrations. Preclinical studies showed that TERN-201 was greater than 7000-fold more selective for VAP-1 than for MAO-A or MAO-B. In clinical studies, TERN-201 has shown strong VAP-1 inhibition at all doses studied, and plasma TERN-201 concentrations, or Cmax, after 7 days of dosing were more than 300 times lower than the IC50 concentrations for MAO-A and MAO–B inhibition at the highest dose level studied. The graph below illustrates the selectivity of TERN-201 for VAP-1 inhibition over MAO inhibition shown in preclinical studies. 
 TERN-201 shows no apparent MAO inhibition

 MAO-A or MAO-B 
 

Clinical development of TERN-201 
 We have completed a first-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial (SAD/MAD) of TERN-201 which assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, in 61 healthy subjects. Single oral TERN-201 doses of 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg and repeat doses of 1 mg and 4 mg (once-daily for 7 days) and 10 mg (once-daily for 14 days) were administered. In the trial, TERN-201 target engagement was assessed by measuring decreases from baseline in the semi-carbazide sensitive amine oxidase, or SSAO, activity which results from VAP-1 enzymatic activity, and by changes from baseline in methylamine, a biomarker that increases in concentration in the blood as its metabolism by VAP-1 is inhibited. 
 TERN-201 demonstrated robust and sustained VAP-1 target engagement. Near complete inhibition of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity was observed at four hours post-dose on Day One in all single and multiple dose groups. There was evidence of dose dependent sustained decreases in VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity for one week after completion of single and repeat dosing due to covalent binding of TERN-201 to VAP-1 and the rate of regeneration of VAP-1 over several days after completion of TERN-201 dosing. Near complete suppression of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity persisted to 7 days after completion of a single TERN-201 dose of 10 mg and repeat doses of 4 mg and 10 mg. Changes from baseline in methylamine were also dose dependent, with the greatest increases from baseline observed in the TERN-201 10 mg dose group in both single and multiple dose cohorts. 
 19


TERN-201 demonstrates near complete inhibition of VAP-1 plasma SSAO activity in single ascending dose Phase 1 trial 
 

In the Phase 1 SAD/MAD clinical trial, TERN-201 administered for up to 14 days was generally well-tolerated with no tolerability signals based on AEs, safety laboratory testing and electrocardiogram monitoring. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that TERN-201 is not extensively metabolized and is unlikely to inhibit or induce major drug metabolism pathways or MAOs; therefore, it has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. This profile as well as its pharmaceutical properties and anticipated low therapeutic dose make it a very attractive candidate for co-formulation with other drugs as part of a single-tablet, fixed-dose combination treatment for NASH. 
 Preclinical data for TERN-201 
 In preclinical studies, TERN-201 demonstrated dose-dependent beneficial effects on liver histology and serum biomarkers comparable to other VAP-1 inhibitors in development. TERN-201 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of rat hepatic stellate cells activation and reduction of fibrosis, inflammation, and ballooning in an in vivo rodent model of liver inflammation and fibrosis. TERN-201 also reduced inflammation and markers of fibrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and hepatic stellate cell activation in an in vivo NASH rodent model. Histological improvements were noted in inflammation and fibrosis scores as shown in the figure below. The animals in the TERN-201 dosing groups had a reduced inflammation score of 1.1, while placebo animals on average had an inflammation score of 2.3. This significant histological response correlates with the anti-inflammatory activity of TERN-201. Fibrosis scores were also reduced with an average score of 2.1 and 2.3 for the low and high TERN-201 dosing groups, respectively, compared to an average score of 2.9 in the placebo group.

 Planned TERN-201 Phase 1b clinical trial 
 We intend to initiate a 12-week Phase 1b clinical trial of TERN-201 in patients with NASH in the first half of 2021 that will assess the tolerability of different doses of TERN-201 and the potential improvements in NASH biomarkers. We expect to enroll approximately 60 patients in this trial. The primary endpoint of this trial will be to assess the safety of TERN-201. We expect top-line data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2022. Following this clinical trial, we will consider subsequent trials of TERN-201 as monotherapy or potentially in combination with a metabolically active NASH treatment. 
 TERN-501 – a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution 
 Drug candidate summary 
 TERN-501 is a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution, characteristics that are intended to improve safety and efficacy in NASH patients. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-β stimulation has been identified as a target for NASH on the basis of its potential to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve serum lipid parameters in NASH patients. For any THR agonist, a key concern is toxicity from excess systemic THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity through THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 has high metabolic stability and a low projected clinical dose, which we believe makes it an attractive candidate for fixed-dose combination co-formulations. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for TERN-501 and we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial in March 2021. We expect top-line data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2021.
 THR-β agonists for NASH 
 Thyroid hormone plays a central role in regulating metabolism, through its actions in multiple tissues, including fat, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver. THR-α and THR-β are nuclear receptors widely expressed in the body, but the two different isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissue types. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-α is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and bone. Selective agonism of THR -β in the liver has been identified as a target for NASH and validated in clinical trials on the basis of its potential to improve hepatic steatosis and lipid profiles in NASH patients. 
 21


Clinical validation of THR-β agonism 
 Data from other NASH clinical studies validate the potential of THR-β agonism as a NASH treatment (the data from other NASH clinical studies described in this paragraph are from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Phase 2 Study of MGL-3196 and Viking Therapeutics, Inc.’s Phase 2 Study of VK2809). In these clinical studies, two different THR-β agonists showed significant reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF, as well as reduction in lipid levels in serum, which may offer additional benefits to NASH patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular comorbidities. One of these clinical trials correlated reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF with histological responses including NAS reduction, NASH resolution and fibrosis resolution. These types of histological responses may be suitable for accelerated approval under current draft guidance from the FDA titled “Noncirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry.” 
 Selectivity towards THR-β over THR-α is key to modulating the metabolic activities in the liver without triggering the unwanted effects of thyroid hormone outside of the liver 
 

Limitations of THR-β targeting 
 For THR agonists, a key safety concern is the potential for adverse effects from off-target thyroid hormone receptor stimulation that may stem from either lack of selectivity for THR-β or high variations in pharmacokinetics due to the lack of metabolic stability. Selectivity for THR-β over THR-α is key to modulating the metabolic activities in the liver without triggering the unwanted effects of THR-α activation outside of the liver. Stimulation of THR-α can adversely affect the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system through increases in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle wasting, and reduced bone mineral density. Therefore, the identification of a selective THR-β agonist particularly with enhanced liver distribution, would have the potential to improve hepatic steatosis and serum lipid profiles while potentially avoiding adverse effects of THR-α activation. However, the use of a liver-targeted pro-drug approach to overcome THR selectivity has not completely avoided cardiac adverse events in clinical trials. 
 In addition to THR-β selectivity, metabolic stability and predictable pharmacokinetics are important considerations in the development of thyroid hormone activators. In a Phase 2 clinical trial of another selective THR-β agonist, lack of metabolic stability resulted in significant inter-patient variability in drug exposure that required PK monitoring and dose adjustments. Dose adjustments in widespread clinical practice present potential challenges in terms of patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, highly variable pharmacokinetics and unpredictable drug concentrations would hinder the potential for combination treatment in NASH patients. 
 22


Our solution for THR-β agonism: high THR-β-selectivity and improved metabolic stability 
 TERN-501 was selected over other discovery candidates because of its high selectivity for THR-β over THR-α, its improved metabolic stability and its enhanced liver-distribution, all of which are characteristics that are intended to improve efficacy and safety in NASH patients. TERN-501 has a similar structural backbone to other THR-β agonists in late stage development that are selective for THR-β. Furthermore, the TERN-501 chemical structure incorporates certain changes designed to enhance metabolic and pharmacokinetic stability, thereby limiting the need for individualized dose adjustments implemented in studies with other THR-β agonists. In a head-to-head comparison, TERN-501 has shown a 23-fold selectivity for THR-β over THR-α stimulation in a cell-free assay, which is higher than the selectivity for two other THR agonists currently in development. TERN-501 is not a pro-drug and does not rely on the metabolic process to make it pharmacologically active. The following chart illustrates the selectivity of TERN-501 as compared to a reference drug and the active metabolite of a pro-drug in clinical development for NASH. 
 TERN-501 demonstrates higher selectivity for THR-β over THR-α


Non-clinical tissue distribution studies show that TERN-501 demonstrates enhanced liver distribution relative to plasma and other organs. From non-clinical studies, TERN-501 is projected to have a predictable human PK profile due to its improved metabolic stability. Due to its metabolic stability, we believe that TERN-501 is unlikely to require PK monitoring and individualized clinical dose adjustment in NASH patients, as was done with another THR-β agonist in development that lacks metabolic stability and has variable PK in humans, thereby avoiding potential challenges associated with monitoring and dose adjustment in clinical practice, including patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Further, TERN-501 is projected to have a low clinically efficacious dose range which, along with its metabolic stability, makes it attractive for long-term NASH treatment and for co-formulation as part of a fixed-dose combination. 
 Preclinical data for TERN-501 
 In preclinical studies, TERN-501 showed potent activity in animal models of metabolic disease. TERN-501 produced rapid and significant reductions in serum lipids in an in vivo rat model; serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced up to 71% and 82%, respectively, 24 hours after a single intraperitoneal injection of TERN-501. In an in vivo mouse NASH model, histological analysis showed that TERN-501 resolved liver steatosis to healthy control levels at all doses and led to a dose-dependent reduction in liver triglycerides and fibrosis. TERN-501 treatment of these mice also led to significant reductions in serum cholesterol, triglycerides and ALT. 
 The graph below compares reductions in plasma cholesterol and plasma triglycerides in an in vivo rat model following a single intraperitoneal administration of various doses of TERN-501 as compared to a reference compound in late-stage clinical development.

 Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial for TERN-501 
 In March 2021, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-501. As a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial, the primary purpose of this trial is to address the safety of TERN-501. We expect to enroll approximately 90 participants in this trial. As with our other clinical programs, this Phase 1 clinical trial is planned to include single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose cohorts in which we intend to assess TERN-501 safety, tolerability and PK, as well as the reduction in serum lipid levels which could serve as an early marker of target engagement. As part of this Phase 1 clinical trial, we also intend to assess drug-drug interactions, including the co-administration of our liver-distributed FXR agonist (TERN-101) and our metabolically stable THR-beta agonist (TERN-501), two mechanisms that have shown additive or synergistic improvements on histological endpoints and serum lipid parameters in our preclinical NASH studies. We expect top-line data from our Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2021. Following this Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to conduct a Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients assessing TERN-501 administered as monotherapy and potentially co-administered with TERN-101.
 24


Combination Therapy Programs 
 Several prior clinical trials evaluating single-agent therapies for NASH have shown only moderate histological improvements and exhibited tolerability issues with some of these agents at high doses. We believe developing combination therapies targeting multiple mechanistic pathways will drive improved response rates for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are well-positioned to develop multiple combination therapies for NASH with our extensive experience in combination drug development and the ability to leverage from within our pipeline of wholly owned single-agents that we believe are attractive candidates for combination development. We are focused on developing combination therapies with clinically validated mechanisms of action to address the multifaceted nature of NASH. Given the strength of our internal resources and capabilities, we have the flexibility to independently advance our combination therapies without the need for a co-development partner at this time. We believe that therapies targeting steatosis (TERN-101 and TERN-501), inflammation (TERN-101 and TERN-201) and fibrosis (TERN-101 and TERN-201) in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical outcomes. 
 Our combination approach: complementary mechanisms for the treatment of NASH 
 

Preclinical data for combination therapies 
 We believe that a combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 has the potential for improved therapeutic benefit for NASH patients. As a liver-distributed FXR agonist, TERN-101 is expected to have effects on multiple facets of NASH, including potential improvements in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. TERN-501 is a THR-β agonist that is expected to potently and rapidly reduce hepatic steatosis and normalize plasma lipid parameters through the modulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those modulated by liver FXR activation. A combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 would therefore be expected to significantly reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in NASH patients through their complementary effects without the need to use maximal dose levels of either agent. The combination may also result in a positive serum lipid profile since TERN-501 is expected to reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in NASH patients in whom FXR agonists have generally not demonstrated potentially therapeutic decreases in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides. 
 As seen in the charts below, the combination of the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501 showed robust efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of NASH by profoundly reducing steatosis and significantly improving fibrosis, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and ALT. The combination treatment of TERN-101 and TERN-501 also resulted in the expression of more than 800 additional distinct genes as compared to either agent alone, supporting our hypothesis that additional biological processes are activated by combination treatment. Together these results suggest that the combination of the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501 may provide additional benefits for NASH patients than either treatment alone. 
 25

Figure: Data from a NASH mouse model. TERN-101 dose 3 mg/kg; TERN-501 dose 1 mg/kg. Liver steatosis (upper left), inflammation (upper middle) and fibrosis (upper right) were quantified by histological analysis for degree of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis. Serum was collected at termination and analyzed for triglycerides, or TG (lower left), total cholesterol, or TC, (lower middle) and a biomarker of liver damage, alanine aminotransferase, or ALT (lower right). Data for individual animals (dots) and mean (dashed line) are presented; **p <0.01, ***p <0.001, ****p <0.
We are also evaluating the potential to combine our VAP-1 inhibitor, TERN-201, with a metabolically active NASH treatment. We believe the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, sustained target engagement, VAP-1 selectivity and anticipated low therapeutic dose of TERN-201 make it suitable for co-administration with therapies directed at steatosis and other metabolic processes involved in NASH. For example, the combination of our FXR agonist TERN-101 and TERN-201 demonstrated histological improvements in inflammation and GGT, an inflammation biomarker, in an in vivo rodent model of NASH. 
 Clinical development plan for NASH combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 
 Our approach for developing a differentiated NASH combination regimen is to discover and develop promising drug candidates targeting clinically validated mechanisms of action, advance them first as monotherapies to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and subsequently conduct Phase 1b or 2a trials to assess safety in NASH patients and potentially efficacious dose ranges using known non-invasive biomarkers of efficacy for these mechanisms of action. Subsequently, we intend to proceed to Phase 2a studies with the coadministration of two or 
 26


more complimentary mechanisms of action—such as the FXR agonist TERN-101 and the THR-β agonist TERN-501—to assess the potential for combinations to generate additive or synergistic effects on these same non-invasive biomarkers relative to monotherapy and inform dose selection for later phase studies of the agents in combination. We then plan to proceed to longer duration Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials that can evaluate our individual monotherapies as well as promising combinations within the same trials to confirm treatment effects using liver biopsy and histological markers of efficacy. We believe this approach maximizes the chance of achieving higher NASH response rates compared to treatment approaches that rely exclusively on single-agent therapeutics and creates efficiencies through the evaluation of our individual monotherapies and combination treatments, allowing us to proceed to marketing authorization applications for those single-agent drug candidates and combination therapies that offer the clearest advantages to patients. The following graphic illustrates our potential combination development plan. 
 

Preclinical Pipeline 
 Our small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, or GLP-1R, agonist program is intended to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH. The natural endogenous ligand, glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent-manner following food ingestion. Activation of the GLP-1 pathway has shown to be effective in driving NASH resolution in studies of available GLP-1 agonists currently approved for the treatment of diabetes. However, these approved agents are synthetic peptides and potentially require higher doses more frequent subcutaneous injections for the potential treatment of NASH. This injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use in NASH patients, particularly if efficacious oral NASH treatments become available. Although an oral GLP-1 peptide formulation is available for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it requires high doses, is associated with adverse effects and lacks NASH efficacy data. A non-peptidic small-molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonist may offer advantages over currently available peptide GLP-1R agonists that have been studied for the treatment of NASH. 
 Our GLP-1R program has identified several potentially suitable small-molecule scaffolds. We plan to further optimize these series of compounds and identify structures that have the potential for once daily oral administration and a profile suitable for combination with other NASH drugs within our pipeline. We aim to nominate a final candidate for further development in the second half of 2021. 
 Manufacturing and supply 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our drug candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers for manufacturing all our drug candidates for preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. 
 27


If any of our drug candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of those drugs. Development and commercial quantities of any drugs that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to establish a targeted commercial infrastructure in key geographies at the appropriate time prior to regulatory approval of our single-agent drugs and fixed-dose combination therapies. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. 
 In addition, we will opportunistically explore commercialization partnerships in territories outside the United States. As our drug candidates progress through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of our target markets, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our commercialization strategies. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We believe that our pipeline, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face potential worldwide competition from many different sources, including large multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, and smaller or earlier stage biotechnology companies. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. Given the high incidence of NASH, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases, including NASH, will increase. Most of our competitors are focused on single-agent product candidates; there are fewer competitors, of which we are aware, who are developing combination therapies for the treatment of NASH. 
 We are aware of both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with development programs in NASH. Large pharmaceutical companies participating in the development of NASH treatments include, but are not limited to, AbbVie, Inc., Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca PLC/MedImmune LLC, Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eisai, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 
 In relation to TERN-101, companies who are currently conducting clinical trials with FXR in the context of NASH include AbbVie, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ENYO Pharma SA, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Metacrine, Inc. and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. 
 TERN-201, our VAP-1 inhibitor, is a relatively novel mechanism for the treatment of NASH, and thus has little competition we are aware of. The companies who are currently developing a SSAO/VAP-1 inhibitor with NASH as a lead indication are LG Chem Ltd. and Novo Nordisk A/S. 
 With regards to TERN-501, companies who are currently conducting clinical trials targeting THR-β in the context of NASH include Ascletis Pharma Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Furthermore, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are developing clinical-stage drugs to treat NASH, using mechanisms not mentioned above, include 89Bio, Inc., Akero Therapeutics, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Axcella Health, Inc., Carmot Therapeutics, Inc., Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., CohBar, Inc., Coherus Biosciences Inc., Corcept Therapeutics, Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Inventiva Pharma SA, 
 28


Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., NorthSea Therapeutics, Inc., Pliant Therapeutics, Inc., Poxel SA, Sagimet Biosciences, Inc., T3D Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Cadila Healthcare. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. 
 Although we believe our drug and combination therapy candidate programs possess appealing attributes, we cannot guarantee that our products will achieve regulatory or market success. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do, or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our drug candidate or any future drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used, and less costly, or have a better tolerability profile than our drugs. These competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. Should we not be able to compete with the aforementioned companies or others, it may hinder our ability to bring our product to market as planned. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. For our patent portfolio for pipeline drug candidates, we seek to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary know-how that may be important to the development of our business. 
 As of March 15, 2021, our owned and exclusively licensed patent portfolio includes: 
  
• | For TERN-101, our FXR agonist, we own five patent families and exclusively license from Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, two patent families, which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-101, its formulations, and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain liver, metabolic and other diseases and conditions. The composition-of-matter patent family includes one issued U.S. patent and over 35 granted foreign patents. The issued U.S. patent in the composition-of-matter patent family is projected to expire, inclusive of patent term adjustment, in 2029, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.

 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future drug candidates, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our drugs depends in large part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to, or licensed by, us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our drug candidates, discovery programs and processes. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our owned or licensed patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, in certain cases, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits such patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and the amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a product, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drugs receive FDA or analogous foreign approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drugs from the applicable authorities where patent term extension is available, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information of our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. 
 30


Moreover, third parties may still obtain this proprietary information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets and know how the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent or other intellectual property or other proprietary right would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or any of our drug candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

 Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements 
 TERN-101 License Agreement with Eli Lilly 
 In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, or the TERN-101 License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property rights, including patents applications filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions claiming the composition of the compound Eli Lilly has designated as LY2562175 and methods of using the same and certain know-how related to the manufacture of LY2562175 owned or controlled by Eli Lilly to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products containing LY2562175, or TERN-101 Products, for all uses and indications in humans. Eli Lilly also has the right, on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis, to negotiate an agreement governing the co-promotion of TERN-101 Products if we, or our sublicensees, decide to commercialize a TERN-101 Product in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the TERN-101 License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, apply for regulatory approval of and commercialize TERN-101 Products in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, Eli Lilly provided us, at its expense, certain support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials. 
 As consideration for the exclusive license, we are required to pay Eli Lilly up to an aggregate of $56 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events for TERN-101 Products; no such milestones have been achieved to date under the TERN-101 License Agreement. 
 We are also required to pay tiered royalties calculated on a calendar year basis, ranging from mid-single digit to mid teen percentages, on net sales of TERN-101 Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on certain generic competition to a TERN-101 Product or amounts paid to any third party under a necessary license to such third party’s patent rights in order to develop, manufacture, commercialize or use a TERN-101 Product. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country, TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights infringed by the sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such TERN-101 Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country. 
 Any intellectual property or inventions developed solely by either party in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the TERN-101 License Agreement shall be owned solely by that party, and any jointly-developed intellectual property or inventions shall be jointly owned (although no joint development activities are anticipated). We have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce certain patents licensed under the TERN-101 License Agreement, including any patents that are solely and directly related to LY2562175 or TERN-101 Products. 
 31


The TERN-101 License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the TERN-101 Products on a country-by-country basis. Upon expiration of the TERN-101 License Agreement, the license granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual and non-exclusive. Either we or Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if we, our affiliates or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. 
 TERN-201 License Agreement with Eli Lilly 
 In March 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, or the TERN-201 License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property rights, including patents applications filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions claiming the composition of the compound Eli Lilly has designated as LY3379274, and methods of using the same and certain know-how related to the manufacture of LY3379274 owned or controlled by Eli Lilly to develop, manufacture, and commercialize therapeutic products containing LY3379274, or TERN-201 Products, for all uses and indications in humans. Eli Lilly has a right of first negotiation to negotiate an agreement covering the commercialization of any TERN-201 Product before we negotiate the same with a third party. Eli Lilly also has the right, on a country-by-country and TERN-201 Product-by- TERN-201 Product basis, to negotiate an agreement governing the co-promotion of TERN-201 Products if we, or our sublicensees, decide to commercialize a TERN-201 Product in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the TERN-201 License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, apply for regulatory approval of and commercialize TERN-201 Products in the People’s Republic of China, the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In addition, Eli Lilly provided us, at its expense, certain support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials. 
 As initial consideration for the license under the TERN-201 License Agreement, we paid Eli Lilly a non-refundable, upfront payment of $4 million. As additional consideration for the exclusive license, we are required to pay Eli Lilly up to an aggregate of $104 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestone events for TERN-201 Products. No development milestones have been achieved to date under the TERN-201 License Agreement. 
 We are also required to pay tiered royalties, ranging from mid-single digit to mid-teen percentages, on annual net sales of TERN-201 Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on certain generic competition to a TERN-201 Product or amounts paid to any third party under a necessary license to such third party’s patent rights in order to develop, manufacture, commercialize or use a TERN-201 Product. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country, TERN-201 Product-by-TERN-201 Product basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights infringed by the sale of such TERN-201 Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such TERN-201 Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such TERN-201 Product in such country. 
 Any intellectual property or inventions developed solely by either party in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the TERN-201 License Agreement shall be owned solely by that party, and any jointly-developed intellectual property or inventions shall be jointly owned (although no joint development activities are anticipated). We have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce certain patents licensed under the TERN-201 License Agreement, including any patents that are solely and directly related to LY3379274 or TERN-201 Products. 
 The TERN-201 License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the TERN-201 Products on a country-by-country basis. Upon expiration of the TERN-201 License Agreement, the license granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual and non-exclusive. Either we or Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement in its entirety or on a 
 32


country-by-country and TERN-201 Product-by-TERN-201 Product basis upon 180 days prior written notice. Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-201 License Agreement if we, our affiliates or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. 
 THR-β Agonist Assignment Agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd. 
 In June 2019, we entered into an assignment agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd., or Vintagence, pursuant to which Vintagence assigned to us certain worldwide intellectual property rights that are directed to THR-β agonists. In particular, we have been assigned a Chinese patent application and potentially certain other patents or patent applications and know-how relating to our THR-β program. We are also entitled to license the rights granted to us under the assignment agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on the assigned intellectual property in each of several major market territories. 
 During the term of the assignment agreement, Vintagence may not develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound covered by any of the assigned patent rights. In the event Vintagence develops a THR-β agonist not covered by the assigned patent rights, we will have the first right to negotiate an assignment or license to exclusively develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit such agonist. 
 As initial consideration for the assignment, we paid Vintagence an upfront payment of CNY 5 million (approximately $0.75 million). As additional consideration, we are required to pay Vintagence up to an aggregate CNY 205 million (approximately $30 million) upon the achievement of specified developmental, clinical and regulatory milestone events with respect to products covered by the agreement. 
 We have the sole responsibility and decision-making authority to prosecute the assigned patents. However, if we decline to pay the prosecution costs for any assigned patent, Vintagence shall have the right to prosecute such assigned patent, and we must assign such assigned patent back to Vintagence. We also have the first right to enforce the assigned patents and know-how. If we do not bring an action to enforce any of the assigned patents or know-how against infringing activities, Vintagence has the right to bring such an action. 
 The assignment agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until we have paid all milestone payments. We may terminate the assignment agreement in its entirety or on a covered product-by-covered product and country-by-country basis without cause with 60 days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the assignment agreement for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 90 days or for the other party’s insolvency. If we terminate the assignment agreement without cause or if Vintagence terminates the assignment agreement for our uncured material breach, we must transfer the assigned intellectual property back to Vintagence. 
 TRN-000632 Exclusive Option and License agreement with Hansoh Pharmaceuticals 
 In July 2020, we, along with our subsidiaries, CaspianTern LLC and Terns, Inc., entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Hansoh pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive option, exercisable during a specified period, to Hansoh to obtain an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patent and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us, including patents claiming the composition of TRN-000632, our small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, and methods of using the same, to research, develop, manufacture, use, distribute, sell and otherwise exploit therapeutic products containing TRN-000632, or Hansoh Products, for all prophylactic, palliative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses in human diseases and disorders in the field of oncology in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, or the Hansoh Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would retain co-exclusive rights under certain know-how licensed to Hansoh and all rights under the patent rights outside of the field of oncology and Hansoh Territory. If Hansoh exercises its option and at our request, the parties will enter into a manufacturing and technology transfer agreement under which Hansoh will provide technical assistance and support related to the manufacture of Hansoh Products containing TRN-000632 as the sole active ingredient, at our cost. Pursuant to the terms of the option and license agreement, upon Hansoh’s exercise of its option, Hansoh must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a Hansoh Product in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh may not exploit any other product in the Hansoh Territory with the same primary mechanism of action as the Hansoh Products. 
 33


As consideration for the exclusive option, we received an upfront, refundable (if Hansoh does not exercise the option) payment of $1 million. Under the license, if Hansoh exercises its option, Hansoh has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate $67.0 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the Hansoh Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under this option and license agreement. Hansoh must also pay us royalties of a mid-single digit percentage on net sales of all Hansoh Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on generic competition to the Hansoh Products or royalties paid to any third party under a license to such third party’s patent rights necessary in order to commercialize a Hansoh Product. The royalty term will terminate on a Hansoh Product-by-Hansoh Product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such Hansoh Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such Hansoh Product in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Hansoh Product in such country. 
 Upon the effectiveness of the license, intellectual property developed out of the activities under this option and license agreement, and that is necessary or useful to exploit TRN-000632 or Hansoh Products, solely developed by one party shall be owned by that party, and jointly-developed intellectual property shall be jointly-owned. Hansoh will have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patent rights in the Hansoh Territory. 
 Hansoh’s right to exercise the option shall expire upon the earlier of 30 days after certain studies are completed or 16 months from the effective date of the option and license agreement. Hansoh can terminate its option at any time. If Hansoh exercises its option, the option and license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Hansoh Products in the Hansoh Territory. Upon expiration of the option and license agreement, the license under our know-how granted to Hansoh shall be considered fully paid-up, perpetual and co-exclusive. Either we or Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement upon 180 days’ prior written notice if the option has been exercised. Hansoh may also terminate the option and license agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain change of control events. If Hansoh terminates the option and license agreement upon such change of control events, we must assign our entire right, title and interest in and to the Hansoh Products, including all intellectual property rights therein, in the Hansoh Territory to Hansoh and Hansoh shall provide us the fair market value of such assignment. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Among others, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our drug and combination therapy candidates. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or 
 34


distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial 
 35


subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In 
 36


addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response 
 37


Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may contain limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more 
 38


clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. 
 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our drug and combination therapy candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. 
 Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or untitled letters;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, “dear doctor” letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 39


 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 40


Foreign Government Regulation 
 Our product candidates will be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by jurisdictions outside of the United States, and, in particular, Europe, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 In order to market our future product candidates in the European Economic Area (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or the EEA, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA, There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
• | the “Community MA,” which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Product candidates for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as biotechnology medicinal product candidates, orphan medicinal product candidates and medicinal product candidates indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for product candidates containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for product candidates that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “National MAs,” which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Data and marketing exclusivity. In the EEA, new product candidates authorized for marketing, or reference product candidates, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Adaptive pathways.    The EMA has an adaptive pathways program which allows for early and progressive patient access to a medicine. The adaptive pathways concept is an approach to medicines approval that aims to improve patients’ access to medicines in cases of high unmet medical need. To achieve this goal, several approaches are envisaged: identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable; making more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data; and involving health technology assessment bodies early in development to increase the chance that medicines will be recommended for payment and ultimately covered by national healthcare systems. The adaptive pathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large clinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; 
 41


compassionate use; the conditional approval mechanism (for medicines addressing life-threatening conditions); patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of real-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine. 
 The adaptive pathways program does not change the standards for the evaluation of benefits and risks or the requirement to demonstrate a positive benefit-risk balance to obtain marketing authorization. 
 PRIME scheme. In July 2016, the EMA launched the PRIME scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the Committee for Medicinal Product candidates for Human Use before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify product candidates for accelerated review earlier in the application process. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 42


Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when the Supreme Court will make a decision. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 2020 through March 2021. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. 
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the CCPA, which went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and 
 43


provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the CPRA was recently voted into law by California residents, which significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect in January 2023, and become enforceable in July 2023. 
 In Europe, we are subject to laws relating to our and our suppliers’, vendors’, partners’ and subcontractors’ collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., any data relating to an identifiable living individual, whether that individual can be identified directly or indirectly). We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established, where we offer goods or services to EEA and United Kingdom residents and where we monitor the behavior of individuals within the EEA or the United Kingdom (i.e., undertaking clinical trials). We and our suppliers, partners and subcontractors process personal data including in relation to our employees, employees of customers, clinical trial patients, healthcare professionals and employees of suppliers including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EEA and the United Kingdom includes the GDPR, the e-Privacy Directive and the e-Privacy Regulation (once in force) and the national laws and regulations implementing or supplementing each of them. 
 The GDPR requires that personal data is only collected for specified, explicit and legal purposes as set out in the GDPR or local laws, and the data may then only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. The personal data collected and processed must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, it must be held securely, not transferred outside of the EEA (unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection), and must not be retained for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. In addition, the GDPR requires companies processing personal data to take certain organizational steps to ensure that they have adequate records, policies, security, training and governance frameworks in place to ensure the protection of data subject rights, including as required to respond to complaints and requests from data subjects. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, requires the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (e.g., health data) is processed on a large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification throughout the EEA and imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with service providers. 
 In addition, to the extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses “special category” personal data (including patients’ health or medical information, genetic information and biometric information), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner in which a company is legally permitted to process that data. Finally, the GDPR provides a broad right for EU and EEA member states to create supplemental national laws which may result in divergence across Europe making it harder to maintain a consistent operating model or standard operating procedures. Such laws, for example, may relate to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. 
 We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. It is our policy to enter into contractual arrangements with each such provider to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements from time to time. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper, unlawful or accidental disclosure, loss, alteration or access to, personal data, particularly sensitive personal data (i.e., special category), could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation. 
 We are also subject to EU laws on personal data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EEA to other jurisdictions which are not considered by the European Commission to offer adequate protection of personal data. Such transfers need to be legitimized by a valid transfer mechanism under the GDPR. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United 
 44


States: in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. GDPR increases financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious violations). Relatedly, following the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU after the expiry of the transition period in January 2021, the United Kingdom will operate a separate but similar regime to the EU which we will have to comply with (with respect to any United Kingdom activities) and allows for fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher).
 
Employees and Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 30 employees, all of whom were full-time, all of whom are engaged in research and development activities, operations, finance and administration. Sixteen of our employees hold doctorate degrees (Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D.). None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our key human capital management objectives include, among others: (i) attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) providing opportunities for learning, development, career growth, and movement within our company; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional, and financial health of team members; (v) obtaining team member feedback; (vi) maintaining and enhancing our culture and mission; and (vii) communicating with our board of directors on a routine basis on key topics. We have implemented and continue to develop many programs designed to achieve these priorities.
