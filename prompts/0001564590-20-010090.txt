Overview 
 We are a development and licensing biotechnology company focused on leveraging our proprietary protein production platform, Pfēnex Expression Technology®, to develop next generation and novel protein therapeutics to meaningfully improve existing therapies and create novel therapies for some of the biological targets linked to critical diseases still waiting to successfully be addressed. We have extensive experience in protein therapeutic development and our proven platform enables deliberate and rapid candidate selection, fast drug development, and potentially higher success rates for a wide range of complex modalities. We aim to leverage existing drug development successes into a broad pipeline that is diversified across multiple assets, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, next generation and novel biopharmaceutical products. 
 In October 2019, the FDA approved the new drug application (NDA) for PF708 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with Forteo® (teriparatide injection) as the reference drug. The FDA-approved PF708 product is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture. Marketing authorization applications are pending in other jurisdictions. This FDA-approved PF708 product will be commercialized and manufactured in the U.S. by our collaboration partner, Alvogen. In November of 2019, in accordance with the Development and License Agreement (US Alvogen Agreement), we transferred the NDA to Alvogen. Alvogen intends to launch the FDA-approved PF708 product in the U.S. upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence evaluation of the product. 
 Our other products and collaborations include PF743 (JZP-458), which we are developing in collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and which commenced a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical study in December 2019. We also have collaborations based on CRM197, a diphtheria toxoid carrier protein used in prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL). Both Merck and SIIPL have licenses to the Pfēnex Expression Technology for the production of CRM197 for use in conjugate vaccine products. Merck’s V114, a 15-valent Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is currently in 15 Phase 3 clinical trials, and SIIPL’s Pneumosil®, a 10-valent Pneumococcal vaccine designed for the developing world, recently achieved World Health Organization (WHO) Prequalification allowing the product to be procured by United Nations agencies and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. 

In addition, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of Pneumosil in healthy Indian infants has been completed and SIIPL is currently in the process of submitting the data from the Phase 3 trial to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in support of India marketing authorization. 
 In the third quarter of 2019 we added PF810, a peptide based next generation therapeutic, to our wholly owned pipeline. PF810 is currently in preclinical development.  In addition, we have established a strategic collaboration with Arcellx, Inc. (Arcellx) to advance multiple proprietary sparX proteins that activate, silence and reprogram Antigen-Receptor Complex T cell based therapies based on the Arcellx product platform.

*  Jazz retains an exclusive option to license this product pursuant to certain option triggers.
 In pursuit of novel wholly-owned product candidates, we have also established a collaboration with a third-party technology platform company who is screening our selected, validated biological targets with its novel binding modality library in an effort to identify potential lead product candidates.  Those candidates will be transferred to us and could become wholly owned product candidates developed by us.
 The FDA-approved PF708 product, our other product candidates, and collaborations are enabled by our patented protein production platform, Pfēnex Expression Technology, which we believe confers several important competitive advantages compared to traditional techniques for protein production. The platform has demonstrated a high success rate for the production of complex proteins with higher titers of high quality protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. The development of proteins requires several competencies which represent both challenges and barriers to entry. Due to their inherent complexity, proteins require the use of living organisms to efficiently produce them at a large scale. Traditional techniques for protein production employ a trial and error approach to production organism, or strain, selection and process optimization, which is inherently inefficient and typically produces suboptimal results. This historically inefficient process provides barriers to creating or replicating complex proteins, adds significant time to market and results in the high cost of goods typical of biologic therapeutics. Together, these limitations pose significant hurdles for companies interested in entering the market with novel biologics, biosimilars and therapeutic equivalents. Our platform utilizes a proprietary high throughput robotically-enabled parallel approach, which allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production strains in parallel, thereby allowing us to produce and characterize complex proteins while reducing the time and cost of development and long-term production. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to leverage our Pfēnex Expression Technology® protein production platform 
and product development infrastructure to become a leading biotechnology company focused on developing a portfolio of wholly-owned and partnered novel and next generation therapeutics.  Given the historical success rates of over 80% in expressing natural and engineered proteins and our demonstrated success in achieving regulatory approval for our lead product we believe our platform, team and infrastructure provides a competitive advantage in the development of novel peptide and protein based therapeutics.

The key elements to execute on our strategy include three focus areas:
 Advance Core Products and Partnerships:
  
• | Maximize PF708’s commercial potential. We received US FDA marketing authorization in October 2019 and are requesting that the FDA designate the FDA-approved PF708 product as therapeutically equivalent (“A” rated) to Forteo, which would potentially permit the product to be automatically substituted for Forteo, depending on applicable laws and policies within each of the 50 states in the US. Alvogen intends to launch the FDA-approved PF708 product in the U.S. upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence evaluation of the product. In February 2019, we and Alvogen entered into additional agreements, extending Alvogen’s rights to commercialize and manufacture PF708 to include the European Union (EU), certain countries in the MENA and to the ROW territories (excluding certain Asian countries granted to NT Pharma). Alvogen has also been seeking marketing authorizations in certain other regions around the world.

• | Advance the Jazz partnered programs. In July 2016, we entered into an agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which we amended in December 2017, to collaboratively develop hematologic oncology products, including PF743 (JZP-458), a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase, and PF745 (JZP-341), a long acting recombinant Erwinia asparaginase. PF743 (JZP-458) commenced a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical study in December 2019, and we achieved a $15 million development milestone for the PF745 (JZP-341) program in December 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our portfolio of license and supply relationships for our CRM197 vaccine carrier protein. We have both licenses and supply agreements in place with vaccine developers like Merck and Serum Institute of India (SIIPL) for the production and supply of CRM197, which is a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin that serves as a carrier protein for therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines. Merck’s V114, a 15-valent Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is currently in 15 Phase 3 clinical trials, and SIIPL’s Pneumosil®, a 10-valent Pneumococcal vaccine, recently achieved World Health Organization (WHO) Prequalification. With the first products moving closer to commercialization, we aim to continue to expand our portfolio of license and supply agreements for CRM 197.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Selectively add wholly owned next generation therapeutics and partnerships where our platform is uniquely enabling:
  
• | Add wholly owned next generation therapeutic programs. We believe our platform enables the development of next generation therapeutics to improve and/or enhance the performance of existing approved products. We have commenced the development of a next generation peptide based therapeutic candidate, PF810, which is currently in preclinical development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish additional product development partnerships. Given our history of expressing a broad range of protein types we believe that the Pfēnex Expression Technology presents a competitive advantage to the biopharmaceutical industry. We aim to further maximize value from the platform and internal capabilities through strategic collaborations where there is compatibility with third party platforms and/or products and our platform is uniquely enabling. An existing collaboration with Arcellx currently has two sparX proteins in development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expand into the development of novel biologics based on targeting validated biological targets with novel modalities in select disease areas. 
  
• | Advance novel modalities via a third-party collaboration. Following a research effort, we have identified a set of high value, validated biological targets that we intend to pursue. The targets of interest are in disease areas of unmet medical need with a moderately sized patient population allowing us to independently develop the products through Phase 3 clinical studies. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we engaged a third-party collaborator to deploy their internal libraries of novel modalities to screen against our targets of interest in order to identify molecules that could potentially become our wholly owned novel products. We are currently in the process of target screening in an effort to isolate the first set of putative lead candidates. Those candidates, PF91X will be transferred to us and could become wholly owned product candidates developed by us.

Our Approach 
 Our patented protein production platform, Pfēnex Expression Technology®, allows us to address hurdles to development and enable our product candidates and those being developed under collaborations. We believe our technology confers several important competitive advantages compared to traditional techniques for protein production, including the ability to produce complex proteins with higher accuracy and greater degree of protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. Our platform utilizes a proprietary high throughput robotically enabled parallel approach, which allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel, thereby allowing us to produce and characterize complex proteins while reducing the time and cost of development and long-term production. 
 We have replaced the traditional, trial and error approach to protein production with a simultaneous, parallel processing model that allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel. We believe our platform delivers a significant competitive advantage for protein production, including higher accuracy, greater degree of protein purity, speed and lower costs. 
 Pfēnex Expression Technology®
Protein Production Overview 
 Protein production is a fundamental activity necessary for biological drug development and manufacturing. The most common method of manufacturing therapeutic proteins involves the use of engineered microorganisms. Proteins produced using these 

organisms are referred to as recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are produced by inserting DNA, or a gene, that codes for the protein, into a cell which then acts as a protein production factory. Typically, this is accomplished by inserting a synthetic gene into an expression vector, which contains genetic control elements that can be used to turn the gene on and off. This vector is then transformed into a set of selected host strains each with a unique phenotype.
 Our platform is based on automated high-throughput screening of large libraries of novel, genetically engineered P. fluorescens bacterial expression strains. The libraries contain thousands of expression strains which are constructed from a large inventory of expression vectors, or genetic elements, incorporated into engineered P. fluorescens host strains. We then employ automated, robotically enabled parallel high-throughput screening, incorporating extensive bioanalytical testing, in order to select strains from the library which express the protein of interest at optimal yields, purity and potency. Extensive fermentation scouting experiments on the selected strains allows for the identification of a final production strain with further improvements in the yield of the active therapeutic protein. 
 Our patented Pfēnex Expression Technology® illustrated in the diagram below utilizes a parallel, high throughput method for microbial strain development compared to the more traditional linear approach of trial and error. 
Our Pfēnex Expression Technology® platform consists of three primary elements that, when combined, deliver a significant competitive advantage for protein production that differentiates us in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
 6


The three elements include: 
  
• | Pseudomonas fluorescens, A Robust Protein Production Organism
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive Library of Expression Vectors and Host Strain Phenotypes
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robotically Enabled High Throughput Screening Capability
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Robust Protein Production Organism 
 P. fluorescens has been used industrially where it has efficiently produced complex proteins. We exploit certain attributes of the P. fluorescens bacterium that enables us to rapidly identify the optimal strain for a specific protein of interest. The favorable attributes of the P. fluorescens bacterium include: 
  
• | Secretion of soluble protein into the bacterial periplasm, the space between the inner and outer membrane in gram negative bacteria, resulting in increased recovery yields of properly folded protein
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | P. fluorescens genome allows for modifications, including deleting protease genes, or nucleotides that provide instructions for synthesis of RNA into a specific protease, and inserting chaperone and/or disulfide bond isomerase genes, or nucleotides that provide instructions for synthesis of RNA into a specific chaperone or disulfide isomerase, which overall increase the quality and production of properly folded active full length proteins
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selection of expression strains without the use of antibiotics
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | High cell density fermentation due to its obligate aerobe growth nature, or bacterium that can only grow in the presence of oxygen, which improves the protein production for characterization, enables consistent scale-up and long-term low cost of goods
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creation of Extensive Library of Protein Expression Strains 
 We have developed an extensive toolbox of engineered production strains and expression vectors that can be readily accessed for finding the best product strain for manufacturing of a specific protein. This toolbox is continuously growing due to our ongoing research and development efforts. We construct thousands of unique expression strains by combining engineered P. fluorescens host strains with proprietary expression vectors. The engineered P. fluorescens strains have reduced expression of protein degrading enzymes and/or increased levels of folding elements while the expression vectors consist of plasmids with engineered genetic elements including promoters, ribosome binding sites and secretion leaders. Determining which of these variants will improve production of any particular protein cannot be determined from the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest. As a result, we employ the automated high throughput screening of the engineered production strains in order to select the strain that produces the protein of interest at optimal purity, yield and potency. 
Robotically Enabled High Throughput Screening 
 Our high-throughput automation supports simultaneous, parallel evaluation of thousands of unique protein production alternatives, enabling rapid identification of the optimal production strain for the protein of interest. Our protein production technology employs rapid construction of protein production strains and testing thousands of unique production strains evaluated through automated sample analysis to determine the titer, or quantity of the product per unit volume, of high quality protein each expression strain produces, which can then be analyzed through our high throughput analytical capacity. Our proprietary, robotically enabled automated high throughput screening process, along with our optimized production organism and toolbox of engineered strains and vectors, as well as our expertise in analytical characterization, expedites the development of an optimal protein production engine from 

approximately one year in a typical case for traditional approaches, if at all possible, to approximately twelve weeks with our Pfēnex Expression Technology®. 
 Our FDA-Approved Product, Our Product Candidates and Collaborations 
 The development of our own portfolio of product candidates and the candidates we have licensed to collaboration partners has been enabled by our successful history of meeting analytically rigorous product specifications for protein quality, yield and potency using our Pfēnex Expression Technology ®. Our pipeline includes product candidates and preclinical products under development in various stages of development. Details of our pipeline and collaborations are included below.

FDA-Approved PF708 Product
In October 2019, the FDA approved the NDA for PF708 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with Forteo® (teriparatide injection) as the reference drug. The FDA-approved PF708 product is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture. The FDA-approved PF708 product will be commercialized and manufactured in the U.S. by our collaboration partner, Alvogen. In November 2019 we transferred the NDA to Alvogen pursuant to our collaboration agreement. Forteo (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company) achieved $1.4 billion in global product sales in 2019. Almost half of these product sales came from the United States alone. Alvogen intends to launch the FDA-approved PF708 product in the U.S. upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence evaluation of the product.
 The FDA approval of the FDA-approved PF708 product was supported by data from Study PF708-301, which compared the effect of PF708 and Forteo in osteoporosis patients. The PF708-301 study enrolled a total of 181 patients, with 90 patients receiving PF708 and 91 patients receiving Forteo. Eighty-two patients completed the study in the FDA-approved PF708 product treatment group, compared with 81 patients in the Forteo treatment group. The primary study endpoint was anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidence after 24 weeks of drug treatment. 2.2% (2/90) of patients who received PF708 and 2.2% (2/91) of patients who received Forteo had detectable antibodies to teriparatide, and one of the two patients who received PF708 developed neutralizing antibodies to teriparatide. The secondary study endpoints included mean percentage changes in lumbar-spine bone mineral density (BMD) and median percentage changes in bone turnover markers (BTM) after 24 weeks of drug treatment, as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for up to four hours after the first dose. Safety endpoints were incidences of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE).
 The PF708-301 study showed comparable overall profiles between PF708 and Forteo across multiple endpoints. These results from the PF708-301 study, along with bioequivalence findings from Study PF708-101 in healthy subjects, supported the PF708 NDA submitted in December 2018 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. On October 4, 2019 the NDA was approved by the FDA. 
 In addition to obtaining FDA approval of PF708, we have been continuing our efforts to obtain an “A” therapeutic equivalence designation for the product relative to its reference drug, Forteo. A determination of therapeutic equivalence (as shown by an “A” rating) may permit the FDA-approved PF708 product to be automatically substituted for Forteo, depending on applicable laws and policies within each of the 50 states in the U.S. Consistent with our interactions with the FDA and the agency’s draft guidance document on comparative use human factors studies for demonstrating the therapeutic equivalence of drug-device combination products, we successfully completed the PF708 comparative use human factors (HF) study and submitted the final study report to the FDA in October 2019. The study data demonstrate that the user interface of the FDA-approved PF708 product was noninferior to that of Forteo for each critical user task evaluated in the study based on a pre-specified statistical analysis of critical patient and caregiver tasks.
 The comparative use HF study was a simulated use study intended to evaluate the effect of each product’s delivery device and user interface on critical task performance by untrained osteoporosis patients and caregivers. The study used a paired design of the FDA-approved PF708 and the Forteo products.
 A total of 102 untrained participants, 52 osteoporosis patients and 50 caregivers, completed the study. For 67% (12 of 18) of critical tasks performed in the patient user group, and 83% (15 of 18) performed in the caregiver group, PF708 had fewer or equal user errors when compared to Forteo. Importantly, in each of the instances where PF708 had marginally higher user error rates 33% (6/18) of critical tasks performed in the patient user group, and 17% (3/18) of critical tasks performed in the caregiver user group, the magnitude of the differences (≤ 2 UEs and ≤ 3 UEs, respectively) did not exceed the predetermined maximum allowable difference in either user group. For these reasons, we believe the study data demonstrate that the user interface of the FDA-approved PF708 product is noninferior to that of Forteo based on pre-specified statistical analysis of critical patient and caregiver tasks. With submission of the final study report to FDA, we believe this completes the information package required by the FDA to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the PF708 product. For a discussion of certain significant risks relating to the FDA-approved PF708 product, please see the following Risk Factors: “The FDA-approved PF708 product, PF708 and our other product candidates, if approved, face significant competition from the reference products and from therapeutic equivalent products of the reference products, and from other products. Our or our collaboration partners’ failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion.” and “If the FDA-approved PF708 product does not receive an “A” therapeutic equivalence designation from the FDA, our business may suffer.”

In June 2018, we and Alvogen, entered into the US Alvogen Agreement pursuant to which Alvogen received the exclusive right to commercialize and manufacture PF708 in the United States. Alvogen intends to launch the FDA-approved PF708 product in the U.S. upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence evaluation of the product. In February 2019 we and Alvogen expanded our collaboration, granting Alvogen exclusive rights to commercialize and manufacture PF708 in the EU, certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the rest of the world (ROW) territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, US and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand). We believe this collaboration leverages Alvogen’s established international experience and expertise in regulatory, IP and supply chain activities, as well as its established network of specialty pharmaceutical companies to conduct sales and marketing activities in these regions. 
 Alvogen submitted a centralized application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for PF708 on May 6, 2019, and the filing was accepted by the EMA on May 23, 2019. We believe that PF708 could be approved in the EU as early as the second half of 2020, pending marketing authorization by the European Commission under the EU centralized procedure and other factors. In October 2019, Alvogen’s partner SAJA, submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for PF708 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, PF708 will be commercialized in Europe and other jurisdictions by Alvogen’s current and/or future commercialization partners and including Theramex in Europe, SAJA, a Tamer Group company in MENA, JAMP Pharma in Canada, Kamada Ltd. in Israel, and Pharmbio Korea, Inc. in South Korea. Alvogen is responsible for overseeing any clinical development, regulatory, litigation, commercial manufacturing or commercialization activities of its partners in these jurisdictions. We are eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $1.5 million for the EU, MENA and ROW agreements, and we may also be eligible to receive up to 60% of Alvogen’s gross profit derived from product sales, if approved, depending on geography and cost of goods sold. In connection with the October 2019 FDA approval of PF708, we earned a $2.5 million milestone payment under our collaboration with Alvogen payable upon Alvogen’s receipt of notice of NDA approval. 
 In April 2018, we and China NT Pharma Group Company Ltd. (NT Pharma) entered into a Development and License Agreement (NT Pharma Agreement), pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to NT Pharma to commercialize PF708 in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and a non-exclusive license to conduct development activities in such territories with respect to PF708. In accordance with the agreement, we received a payment of $2.5 million upon signing the NT Pharma Agreement and may be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $22.5 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and sales-related milestones. We may also be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of PF708. NT Pharma is responsible for any further development required to achieve regulatory approval as well as commercialization activities in the applicable territories.
 In accordance with regulatory requirements we provided notice of Paragraph IV certification (Notice Letter) to Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) on February 19, 2019 that PF708 does not infringe any valid claim of the ’334 patent. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, Lilly had 45 days from the receipt of the Notice Letter to file a patent infringement lawsuit against us that would cause a 30-month litigation stay of approval for PF708. On April 11, 2019 we announced the expiration of the 45-day period for Lilly to file a lawsuit under the Hatch-Waxman Act and stay the approval of PF708 for 30 months. Lilly did not file a lawsuit within this time period, and there was no 30-month litigation stay that delayed approval of the FDA-approved PF708 product.
 In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Alvogen for us to provide PF708 drug substance batches and pen components in exchange for $2.3 million. This product sold to Alvogen was initially manufactured by our CMO for manufacturing process 


validation purposes as part of the PF708 NDA submission to the FDA for approval. 
 Jazz Collaboration – multiple hematologic oncology product candidates 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license and option agreement with Jazz, pursuant to which we and Jazz are developing hematologic oncology products, including PF743 (JZP-458), a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase, and PF745 (JZP-341), a long-acting recombinant Erwinia asparaginase, and Jazz will have the exclusive right to manufacture and commercialize such products throughout the world. In addition, pursuant to the agreement, we have granted Jazz certain other rights to negotiate the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize throughout the world other hematologic oncology products that are currently or in the future may be developed by us. Both PF743 (JZP-458) and PF745 (JZP-341) are being developed for the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and other hematological malignancies.  In the third quarter of 2017, we achieved a process development milestone associated with this collaboration.  In December 2017, we and Jazz signed an amended and restated agreement under which we will be eligible to receive an additional $43.5 million in amendment fee and development milestone payments as compared to the 2016 agreement, increasing the total value of upfront, option and amendment fee payments and potential payments for the achievement of development, regulatory and sales-related milestones associated with the collaboration to an aggregate of $224.5 million. We will also continue to be eligible to receive tiered royalties on worldwide sales of any products resulting from the collaboration at rates reduced from 
 9


those under the 2016 agreement. In December 2017, as part of the amended and restated agreement, we received a total payment of $18.5 million, consisting of an upfront payment of $5.0 million and a payment of $13.5 million for development achievement. In the second quarter of 2018, we achieved two development milestones and received $0.8 million for successful achievement of process development milestones for PF745. In August 2019, Jazz reported that they completed a Phase 1 study for PF743 (JZP-458). After receiving Fast Track designation from the FDA in October 2019, Jazz announced the initiation of a Phase 2/3 pivotal study for PF743 (JZP-458) in December 2019 and recently announced their intent to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the US FDA as early as the fourth quarter of 2020. In September 2019 and December 2019, we achieved a development milestone and received $11 million and $15 million, respectively, in connection with process development activities for PF745 (JZP-341).
 CRM197  
 We have both licenses and supply agreements in place for CRM197, which is a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin. It is a well-characterized protein and functions as a carrier for polysaccharides and haptens, making them immunogenic. We have developed unique CRM197 production strains based on our Pfēnex Expression Technology platform. As a result of our development efforts, we previously entered into commercial licenses for production strains capable of producing CRM197 with both Merck and SIIPL. Merck and SIIPL are using the CRM197 produced via the licensed production strain in multiple clinical and pre-clinical stage products. The clinical stage products currently include Merck’s 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV-15 (V114), currently in several ongoing Phase 3 clinical studies, and SIIPL’s 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Pneumosil®, which achieved WHO Prequalification in December 2019, and a pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine currently in a Phase 3 clinical study. The CRM197 production strains utilized by both Merck and SIIPL are unique and exclusively licensed to each party. The commercial license agreements with Merck and SIIPL contemplate potential maintenance and milestone fees as well as royalties on net sales. Additionally, as part of the SIIPL commercial license agreement, SIIPL supplies both reagent grade and cGMP CRM197 to Pfenex, which supplies the product to vaccine development-focused pharmaceutical partners.
 Arcellx Development, Evaluation and License Agreement  
 We previously entered into a development, evaluation and license agreement with Arcellx which provides access to the Pfēnex Expression Technology platform to advance Arcellx’s proprietary sparX proteins that activate, silence and reprogram Antigen-Receptor Complex T cell-based therapies. Under the terms of the agreement, we are eligible to receive development funding in addition to development, regulatory and commercial milestones ranging from $2.6 million to $18 million for each product incorporating a sparX protein expressed using a production strain based on the Pfēnex Expression Technology, as well as royalties on worldwide sales of any such products. We have completed the development of both sparX-1 (PF753) and sparX-2 (PF754) and Arcellx has opted into the commercial license for both production strains. As of December 31, 2019, we have earned $2.4 million in development funding from Arcellx.
Other Pipeline Products 
 In the third quarter of 2019 we added PF810, a peptide based next generation therapeutic, to our wholly owned pipeline. PF810 is currently in preclinical development.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
 The development of Px563L and RPA563 is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through BARDA. In March 2019 the Company received a notice from BARDA advising it of BARDA’s decision not to exercise development options for cGMP manufacturing, preclinical studies and Phase 1/2b study readiness in connection with the Company’s Px563L and RPA563 novel anthrax vaccine program. Following the receipt of the notice from BARDA and pursuant to discussions with BARDA, the Company deprioritized this program in its portfolio.
Customers 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had generated revenue from government contracts, service agreements, collaboration agreements, and reagent protein product sales. Our total revenue was $50.3 million, $14.9 million and $28.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019 and 2017, our achievement of certain development milestones related to our collaboration agreement with Jazz resulted in significant revenue.  Our development and license agreement with Alvogen also resulted in significant revenue in 2019. The advanced development contract we have with BARDA provided additional revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017.  
 For the year ended December 31, 2019, Jazz and Alvogen each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Jazz and BARDA each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in the European Economic Area, at the European Union and national Member State level, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, promotion, advertising, storage, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
United States Government Regulation 
 BLA/NDA Development and Approval Process 
 The process generally required by the FDA before a biologic or drug product candidate may be marketed in the United States involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA after successful completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic product in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (cGCPs), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB for each site where the study is conducted must also approve the study. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the registration of ongoing clinical studies and the reporting of clinical study results to public registries. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three or four sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate enough data to evaluate, in a statistically rigorous manner, dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal trial is a clinical study that is designed to generate substantial evidence of a product’s safety and efficacy that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB, or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or data monitoring committee. Such a group recommends to the sponsor whether or not a trial should move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 12


Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application has been granted priority review because the proposed drug addresses an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Generally, the FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s quality and purity. 
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, clinical data, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a product with active ingredients that have not been previously approved to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. The FDA also can seek advice from an advisory committee at its own discretion when an NDA or BLA presents scientific, technical, or policy questions on which the agency believes it would benefit from the perspectives of outside experts. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we and our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product under the conditions of use described in the product’s prescribing information. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval. 
 13


Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for marketed products. Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of 
clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted unapproved uses may be subject to significant enforcement action and liability. 
 The FDA may withdraw or suspend approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in a variety of consequences, including revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adverse publicity, fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved branded product by demonstrating the proposed generic product’s sameness to the approved drug. Additionally, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may, under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), file a new drug application (NDA) that relies on studies not conducted by the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference as part of the data demonstrating the product’s safety and effectiveness. Often, this is done by relying on FDA’s previous approval of a product to which the proposed drug is similar (but for which there are differences that preclude an ANDA). Among other things, this kind of reliance avoids unnecessary duplication of studies performed on a previously approved (“reference” or “listed”) drug that can reasonably be extrapolated to the proposed product. We pursued a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our FDA-approved PF708 product; the NDA references Forteo (teriparatide), which is marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis, as a listed drug. 
 An NDA sponsor must list with the FDA patents that claim the subject product (the drug substance or product formulation) or an FDA-approved method of using the product. Those patents are published in the Orange Book with the product listing. A 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a listed drug must contain one of the following certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book with the referenced product: (1) that no such patent information has been listed in the Orange Book, referred to as a Paragraph I Certification; (2) that such patent has expired, referred to as a Paragraph II 
 14


Certification; (3) the date on which such patent expires, referred to as a Paragraph III Certification; or (4) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted, referred to as a Paragraph IV Certification. With regard to patents that claim a method of use, the applicant may instead submit a “section viii” statement certifying that the proposed labeling does not contain any language regarding the patented method of use; this typically reflects the sponsor having “carved out” any such labeling. A Paragraph III Certification conveys that the applicant will wait to obtain approval until the subject patent expires. A Paragraph IV Certification is a challenge to the ability of the subject patent to prevent approval of the proposed product. An applicant making a Paragraph IV Certification must provide notice of the patent challenge to the owner of the subject patent and to the reference product sponsor. If, with 45 days of the Paragraph IV notice, either of those entities files a lawsuit alleging patent infringement, the FDA is prohibited from approving the 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months (or a shorter period if the patent expires or there are certain settlements or judicial decisions in the patent litigation). 
 Additionally, a 505(b)(2) NDA will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug has expired. These exclusivities include new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity, which is awarded to a product that contains an active moiety that has not previously been approved by the FDA. An “active moiety” is the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. NCE exclusivity provides a five-year period during which the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a product containing the same active moiety. The five-year period is shortened to four years if the proposed application contains a Paragraph IV Certification. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This exclusivity precludes the FDA granting final approval to any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that references the product until three years after the product was approved. Unlike NCE exclusivity, however, three-year exclusivity does not prevent the FDA accepting and reviewing the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, the term of some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. For a product that represents the first permitted commercial marketing of an active ingredient, we may have the opportunity to extend the term of a patent that claims the drug or a method of using or manufacturing the drug. The extension cannot exceed five years or extend the patent term beyond fourteen years after approval, but it is calculated generally as half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of the NDA or Biologics License Application, or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and approval of the application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Such a product, known as a “biosimilar,” is a biological product that is highly similar to a previously approved biological (the “reference product”), notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency between the biosimilar and the reference product. The abbreviated approval pathway is intended to allow the biosimilar to be approved in part in reliance on what is known about the reference product. In addition, if certain additional conditions are shown, a biosimilar product can be designated as “interchangeable” with the reference product, meaning that the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. To date, the FDA has not approved any biosimilar product as being interchangeable to the reference product. FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. Because of complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the processes by which such products are manufactured, FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—including laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical data—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. The FDA considers the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. 
 15


The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the reference product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the reference product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to other types of exclusivities, such as orphan drug exclusivity (which provides seven years of exclusivity against approval of the same drug intended to treat the same disease or condition) or pediatric exclusivity (which adds six months to existing exclusivities, among other things). The first biosimilar product determined to be interchangeable with a reference product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. 
 In addition, the BPCIA includes a detailed framework for addressing potential patent disputes between the sponsors of a biosimilar product and the reference product. 
 While it may be possible for a biosimilar applicant and reference product sponsor to settle any patent disputes prior to approval, patent litigation may delay the ability of a biosimilar applicant to commercially launch its product. 
 We anticipate that the contours of the BPCIA will continue to be defined as the statute is implemented over a period of years. This likely will be accomplished by a variety of means, including decisions related to the statute by relevant federal courts, FDA issuance of guidance documents, and FDA decisions in the course of considering specific applications. 
 European Economic Area Regulation 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, comprising the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the information that must be submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or to the competent authorities in the relevant European Union Member States varies depending on whether the biological medicinal product is a new product, whose quality, safety and efficacy has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a product whose known biological active substance and certain other properties are similar to those of a previously authorized (reference) biological medicinal product. The European Directive 2001/83/EC as amended defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances: 

• | presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended further defines the category of biological medicinal products as: 
  
• | a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs for its characterization and the determination of its quality a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing, together with the production process and its control.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Examples of biological medicinal products include recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and products derived from human blood or plasma. 
 Approval of New Biological Medicinal Products 
 In the EEA, all medicinal products (biological or not) can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MA: 
 The Centralized MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP of the EMA, is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as medicinal products derived from certain biotechnology processes (including biotechnology-derived proteins such as the ones we make), orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 16


National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 More concretely, the requirements for centralized marketing authorization of a new biological medicinal product in the EEA generally include but are not limited to: 
  
• | submission of the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests and preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests through laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of the results of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the quality, safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a statement to the effect that clinical trials carried outside the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an application for marketing authorization to the EMA or to the competent authorities of the relevant EU Member States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of the applicant in the EEA;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | description of the qualitative and quantitative particulars of all constituents of the medicinal product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluation of the potential environmental risks posed by the medicinal product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | description of the manufacturing method, description of the control measures employed by the manufacturer, and a document showing that the manufacturer is authorized in his own country to produce medicinal products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a summary of product characteristics, therapeutic indications, adverse reactions, dosage, pharmaceutical form, route of administration and expected shelf life;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional information for specific classes of medicinal products, such as a Vaccine Antigen Master File documentation for vaccine products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a summary of the pharmacovigilance system, the risk management plan describing the risk-management system, and proof that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance as well as the necessary means for fulfilling the EU pharmacovigilance obligations including the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the EEA or in a third country; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review by EMA’s CHMP or the competent authorities in the relevant European Union Member States and approval of the marketing authorization application.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of the product’s structure, purity and biological activity, as well as animal studies to determine toxicity and pharmacology. An Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) sponsor must submit a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to the competent authority prior to initiation of human clinical trials. The application process to perform a clinical trial in the EEA is governed on a country-by-country basis. A sponsor must apply in each country in which it intends to conduct any part of a human clinical trial. While the process is similar in most countries, additional materials may be required in certain instances. For example, in many, but not all European countries, a sponsor must submit a copy of the insurance coverage obtained to cover the clinical study. Australia and New Zealand adhere to EMA guidelines with respect to the regulation of IMPs and clinical trials. 
 17


Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing and having met all criteria set forth by Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the applicant may choose to proceed with submission of marketing authorization application. If the application is accepted for review in the Centralized Procedure, within 210 days (excluding clock stops), the EMA’s CHMP will issue an opinion on whether the conditions for granting marketing authorization are satisfied. During the review period, the scientific committees will review the scientific data, may request for independent testing of the medicinal product, its starting materials, or other constituent materials, may request supplemental information from the applicant, may request for proof of cGMP compliance of the manufacturer, and may request for said manufacturing facilities to be inspected. 
 Accelerated Review 
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
Approval of Similar Biological Medicinal Products 
 Similar biological medicinal product applications of medicinal products authorized via the Centralized Procedure have automatic access to the Centralized Procedure. A similar biological medicinal product, also known as a biosimilar, is a product that is similar to a biological medicine that has already been authorized, the so-called “reference medicinal product”. The active substance of a similar biological medicinal product is a known biological active substance and similar to the one of the reference medicinal product. A similar biological medicinal product and its reference medicinal product are expected to have the same safety and efficacy profile and are generally used to treat the same conditions. 
 The similar nature of a biosimilar and a reference product is demonstrated by comprehensive comparability studies covering quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy. The minimum expectation of data supplied with the application will include pharmaceutical, chemical, and biological preclinical data, as well as bioequivalence and bioavailability (bodily distribution and concentration) clinical data. The type and amount of additional information, such as toxicological and other preclinical and clinical data, is determined on a case-by-case basis. 
 European Union legislation provides (with respect to reference products for which a marketing authorization was applied for after October 30, 2005 under the Decentralized, Mutual Recognition and national procedures, or after November 20, 2005, for products authorized under the Centralized Procedure) for an eight-year period of data protection and ten-year period of market exclusivity for medicinal products which received marketing authorization in accordance with, respectively, Directive 2001/83/EC as amended or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 as amended. The provisions also state that if, during the first eight years of authorization, the holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which are deemed to have significant clinical benefit as compared to existing therapies, the original market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years. The data and market exclusivity periods start from the date of the initial authorization, which for reference medicinal products authorized through the Centralized Procedure is the date of notification of the marketing authorization decision to the marketing authorization holder of the reference product. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once granted, initial marketing authorization of a medicinal product is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. At that point, once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid indefinitely or, if justified on grounds of pharmacovigilance, may be restricted to an additional five-year authorization period. 
 Marketing authorization holders are required to maintain a pharmacovigilance system and to maintain detailed records of all suspected adverse reactions in the EEA or in a third country. Serious suspected adverse reactions are to be communicated to the appropriate EEA regulatory authorities no later than 15 days after receipt of the information. EEA regulations require periodic safety reporting leading up to and following marketing authorization, based on a defined schedule, for as long as the product is marketed, or when immediately requested by regulatory authorities. An increase in incidents of adverse events or any cause for a change in opinion by the EMA pertaining to the risk-benefit balance may lead to suspension, variation, or revocation of marketing authorization and would severely impact our business. 
 18


EEA regulations also stipulate that regulators, such as the Competent Authorities of the EEA Member States, independently or coordinated by the EMA, may carry out repeated or unannounced inspections of the medicinal product manufacturer or at the premises of the marketing authorization holder, regarding compliance with cGMP principles and guidelines. Compliance issues identified at our facilities or at third-party manufacturers may disrupt clinical or commercial production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. This may result in the delay of clinical trials or commercial product launch. Discovery or problems with the product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, the manufacturer or the holder of a marketing authorization, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other EMA or EEA Competent Authority initiated action that could delay or prohibit future marketing. Additionally, new government regulations may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of therapeutic equivalent products for branded prescription drugs. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, established mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress are expected to attempt changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”), including as a result of current and future executive orders, legislative actions, and court cases. The impact of those changes on us is currently unknown. But, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulations in the United States may have on our business. 
 In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 19


The marketability of any products for which we and our collaboration partner receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we and our collaboration partners obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws that may impact, among other things, our or our collaboration partners’ proposed sales, marketing and education programs. The laws that may affect our operations include: 

• | The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent, to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring FCA qui tam actions on behalf of the government and such individuals and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement for violations. Criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, are also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;

• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and

• | State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 We and our collaboration partners also may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards implemented to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our or our collaboration partners’ employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us or our collaboration partners, any of which would likely harm our or our collaboration partners’ reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Hazardous Materials 
 Our research and development processes may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance. 
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of protein therapeutics is highly competitive. While we believe that our Pfēnex Expression Technology ®, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In the event that we and our collaboration partners were to market and sell any of our biopharmaceutical products, we would face competition from the companies producing branded reference drugs, as well as biosimilars, therapeutic equivalents, and other 

products that would compete with our product candidates, if approved. For example, PF708, our FDA approved product, may face competition from the reference product sponsor, Eli Lilly and Company, or other competition from companies like Teva and Gedeon Richter Plc., and from Amgen Inc. and Radius Health, Inc. as developers of novel products. For example, in April 2017, the FDA approved Radius Health’s TYMLOS®, and in April 2019 approved Amgen’s Evenity (romosozumab), each of which could potentially compete with PF708. Key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be price, the level of biosimilar, therapeutic equivalent and novel product competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Similarly, our novel vaccine development programs face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies that are actively working on improved and novel vaccines. We believe that our primary competitors include Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. and Altimmune, Inc. These companies are receiving funding from BARDA for the development of next generation anthrax vaccines. All of our novel vaccine efforts will face competition for limited government funding from other non-vaccine defensive measures as well, including medical countermeasures for biological, chemical and nuclear threats, diagnostic testing systems and other emergency preparedness countermeasures. 
 21


Further, many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 To date, PF708 is our only FDA-

approved product under 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with Forteo as the reference drug. None of our other product candidates have received marketing authorization from any regulatory agency. For our product candidates, we generally seek to license rights regionally to commercially proficient partners. To the extent that we retain commercial rights to product candidates, we may use an internal sales force to commercialize products for which we may receive marketing approvals in territories in which we believe it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialty sales force. 
 In June 2018, we and Alvogen entered into a Development and License Agreement (US Alvogen Agreement) pursuant to which Alvogen has the exclusive right to commercialize and manufacture PF708 in the United States. Alvogen intends to launch the FDA-approved PF708 product in the U.S. upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence evaluation of the product. In February 2019 we and Alvogen expanded our collaboration, granting Alvogen exclusive rights to commercialize and manufacture PF708 in the EU, certain countries in the MENA, and the ROW territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, US and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand).  We believe this collaboration leverages Alvogen’s established international experience and expertise in regulatory, IP and supply chain activities, as well as its established network of specialty pharmaceutical companies to conduct sales and marketing activities in these regions.  
 Alvogen submitted a centralized application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for PF708 on May 6, 2019, and the filing was accepted by the EMA on May 23, 2019. We believe that PF708 could be approved in the EU as early as the second half of 2020, pending marketing authorization by the European Commission under the EU centralized procedure and other factors.  In October 2019, Alvogen’s partner SAJA, submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for PF708 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, PF708 will be commercialized in Europe and other jurisdictions by Alvogen’s current and/or future commercialization partners including Theramex in Europe, SAJA, a Tamer Group company in MENA, JAMP Pharma in Canada, Kamada Ltd. in Israel, and Pharmbio Korea, Inc. in South Korea. Alvogen is responsible for overseeing any clinical development, regulatory, litigation, commercial manufacturing or commercialization activities of its partners in these jurisdictions.  We are eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $1.5 million for the EU, MENA and ROW agreements, and we may also be eligible to receive up to 60% of Alvogen’s gross profit derived from product sales, if approved, depending on geography and cost of goods sold. In connection with the October 2019 FDA approval of PF708, we earned a $2.5 million milestone payment under our collaboration with Alvogen payable upon Alvogen’s receipt of notice of NDA approval. 
 In April 2018, we and China NT Pharma Group Company Ltd. (NT Pharma) entered into a Development and License Agreement (NT Pharma Agreement), pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to NT Pharma to commercialize PF708 in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and a non-exclusive license to conduct development activities in such territories with respect to PF708. In accordance with the agreement, we received a payment of $2.5 million upon signing the NT Pharma Agreement and may be eligible to receive additional payments of up to $22.5 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and sales-related milestones. We may also be eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of PF708. NT Pharma is responsible for any further development required to achieve regulatory approval as well as commercialization activities in the applicable territories.

Upon marketing approval for products developed under our collaboration with Jazz, Jazz will assume responsibility for the manufacturing and commercialization of certain hematologic oncology products globally. 
 We have sales and marketing capabilities to support our commercial efforts for our platform partnership and CRM197 sales.
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our platform technology and our products or product candidates, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success depends substantially on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology and product candidates, to defend and enforce our patents to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position relating to our platform technology and product candidates. 
 We are the owner or licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business. As of December 31, 2019, we are the sole owner of a patent portfolio that consisted of a total of 24 U.S. issued patents and six U.S. non-provisional patent applications that provide material coverage for our platform technology and our lead product candidates as well as foreign granted and pending patent applications which are counterparts to certain of the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. Our U.S. issued patents expire during the time period beginning in 2023 and ending in 2036. Our owned and exclusively licensed patent portfolio includes claims directed to: 
  
• | methods for bacterial protein production and methods for rapid screening of an array of expression systems
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | P. fluorescens promoter sequences and secretion leader sequences
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | auxotrophic marker systems for antibiotic free maintenance of expression plasmids in high cell density cultures,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improved incorporation of non-natural amino acids
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | expression of classes of proteins such as cytokines
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | antibody derivatives
--+---------------------


• | microbial toxins in P. fluorescens
--+-----------------------------------


• | methods and expression strains for production and/or purification of soluble full length human cytokines, Interferon beta and G-CSF
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | vaccine antigens recombinant anthrax protective antigen, microbial toxins and toxoids, and the malarial vaccine candidate antigen P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fusion partners for peptide production
--+---------------------------------------

 Pursuant to the technology licensing agreement, The Dow Chemical Company, or TDCC, and Dow Global Technologies LLC, or DGTI, also granted to us non-exclusive licenses to U.S. patents and applications and their foreign counterparts covering methods and technologies for recovery of proteins and peptides from P. fluorescens cells. In conjunction with the licenses granted by TDCC and DGTI to us under the technology licensing agreement, we also entered into a grant-back and technology license agreement, pursuant to which we granted to TDCC exclusive and non-exclusive licenses under certain patent rights and know-how relating to our Pfēnex Expression Technology® to use certain biological materials to make, use and commercialize products in certain fields of use that do not include human therapeutics. See “Business—Collaborations, Joint Development and Licenses” for a detailed description of our agreements with TDCC and DGTI.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining issued claims that cover our technology and product candidates and being able to enforce those claims against our competitors once granted. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our products. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities and our third-party manufacturers’ and suppliers’ activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including, small quantities of acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, ethidium bromide and compressed gases, and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers’ facilities pending their use and disposal. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations. 
Suppliers 
 We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our clinical trials. With the exception of PF708 for which we have granted Alvogen the exclusive rights to commercialize for select territories, we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture any products that we may commercialize in the future. We have established an internal pharmaceutical development group to develop manufacturing methods for our product candidates, to optimize manufacturing processes, and to select and transfer these manufacturing technologies to our suppliers. We contract with multiple manufacturers to ensure adequate product supply and to mitigate risk. 
 There currently are a limited number of these manufacturers. Furthermore, some of the contract manufacturers that we have identified to date only have limited experience at manufacturing, formulating, analyzing and packaging our product candidates in quantities sufficient for conducting clinical trials or for commercialization. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. 
 24


Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate facilities for cGMP manufacturing of any products. We intend to rely on Alvogen for PF708 manufacturing. We have personnel with experience in the development of United States and European Union cGMP-compliant processes and management of Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs), to oversee the technology transfer to the manufacturers of PF708, and other product candidates that we may develop. Our manufacturing processes employ standard equipment common to CMOs. Our processes also use common and widely available materials, and our well-established manufacturing procedures are robust, scalable, and readily transferable to support our clinical development programs and commercialization of our products. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. For a discussion of risks related to our sources and availability of supplies, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties—We rely on third-party suppliers, and in some instances a single third-party supplier, for the manufacture and supply of certain materials in our protein production services, and these suppliers could cease to manufacture the materials, go out of business or otherwise not perform as anticipated.”
In each of our agreements with contract manufacturers, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are assigned ownership of processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property generated during the course of the performance of each agreement that primarily relate to our products. Where applicable, we are granted non-exclusive licenses to certain contract manufacturer intellectual property for purposes of exploiting the products that are the subject of the agreement, and in a few instances, we grant non-exclusive licenses to the contract manufacturers for use outside of our product area. In each contract, we have the right to terminate for convenience. The agreements also contain typical provisions for both parties to terminate for material breach, and bankruptcy and insolvency. 
 Protein Production 
 Utilizing our Pfēnex Expression Technology®, we provide protein production and process development services to third parties on a fee for service basis in support of the development of novel biopharmaceuticals. Pursuant to a license agreement, the third-party licenses a production strain from us and then pays us an up-front payment, milestone payments based upon clinical progression and regulatory filings, and a royalty based on product net sales. Our protein production efforts enable us to maximize the utilization of our Pfēnex Expression Technology ®, expand our institutional knowledge and generate revenue. 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenues are not seasonal in nature. 
 U.S. Government Contracts 
 Revenue from U.S. Government Contracts varies by year. A portion of our government business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government. In addition to contract terms, we must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to the termination of contracts at the election of the government or the suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting. U.S. Government revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately 3%, 32% and 20% for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. 
 Employees 
 We believe that our success will depend greatly on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. As of December 31, 2019, we had 81 employees, including a total of 21 employees who hold Ph.D. or other doctoral degrees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Backlog 
 We have no material backlog of orders.
