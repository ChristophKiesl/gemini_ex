ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
As used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “LFC,” “Company” or “our Company” refers to Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc.
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc., and on September 16, 2013 our corporate name was changed to Cala Energy Corp., (formally, Xodtec LED, Inc.) under which we were engaged in the business of offering services, such as enhanced oil recovery and material supplies, to gas and oil fields predominantly located in Southeast Asia. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business. Since that time, and prior to the “Exchange Agreement” (defined below) we have been a "shell company", as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
On March 31, 2015, the Company, pursuant to share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), among the Company, Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. (“LFC”), and the holders of all of the outstanding common stock and convertible notes of LFC exchanged their common stock and convertible notes of LFC for a total of 16,750,000 shares of common stock, which represented 84.70% of the Company's common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and the shares of common stock issued in the private placement described in the following paragraph. The issuance of the 16,750,000 shares of common stock to the former holders of LFC's common stock and convertible notes in exchange for the capital stock of LFC is referred to as the reverse acquisition transaction. The sole director and chief executive officer of LFC became a director and the chief executive officer of the Company. As a result of the reverse acquisition, the Company's business has become the business of LFC.
 
On March 31, 2015, contemporaneously with the closing pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $0.08 per share, for a total of $200,000. The proceeds from the private placement were held in escrow on March 31, 2015, and were paid to the Company on April 2, 2015. Accordingly, on March 31, 2015, the proceeds from the private placement are reflected as a subscription receivable. None of the purchasers in the private placement are affiliates of the Company.
 
As a result of the reverse acquisition with LFC, we ceased to be a shell company on March 31, 2015.

Effective as of April 1, 2015, we changed our name to "Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc." a name which more accurately represents our new business. We effected the name change by virtue of a short form merger, pursuant to which LFC (our wholly owned subsidiary after the LFC Acquisition) merged with and into the Company, with the Company remaining as the surviving parent corporation. In connection with the name change, we submitted to FINRA a voluntary request for the change of our OTC trading symbol. Our Common Stock now trades under the symbol “BOTY”.
 
As a result of, and in connection with, the reverse acquisition, the Company changed its fiscal year to December 31, which was LFC's fiscal year, from a fiscal year ending February 28.
 
On April 20, 2015, the Company effected a one-for-800 reverse split, pursuant to which each share of common stock was converted into, and became 1/800 of a share of common stock, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next higher whole number of shares. As a result of the reverse split, the 339,757,357 shares of common stock, then outstanding, became and were converted into 424,977 shares. All references to shares of common stock and per share information retroactively reflect the reverse split.
 
On September 14, 2016, Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (the “Company”) filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which, among other things, established the designation, powers, rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). 
 
Among other provisions, each one (1) share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have voting rights equal to (x) 0.019607 multiplied by the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote (the “Numerator”), divided by (y) 0.49, minus (z) the Numerator. For purposes of illustration only, if the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote is 5,000,000, the voting rights of one share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be equal to 102,036 (0.019607 x 5,000,000) / 0.49) – (0.019607 x 5,000,000) = 102,036).
 
Fifty-one (51) shares of Series A Preferred Stock were authorized and fifty-one (51) shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued to Shaun Donnelly, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. 
 
On November 22, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from four hundred million (400,000,000) shares to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares. A true and correct copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report.
 
On January 23, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from one billion (1,000,000,000) shares to one billion two hundred million (1,200,000,000) shares. A true and correct copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this report.
 
The Company did not timely comply with the requirements of Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act for the above referenced increases in the Company’s authorized common shares. This would have required us to circulate an information statement describing the corporate actions taken above by the written consent of a majority of our shareholders at least 20 days prior to the effective date of the corporate action. We did however have super majority shareholder consent as required for amending the articles of incorporation The failure to initially comply with Regulation 14C in a timely manner was inadvertent, and while not probable, could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure to comply with Regulation 14C. Such enforcement could subject us to penalties including the payment of fines or damages. Any such claims or actions could cause us to expend financial resources to defend ourselves, and could divert the attention of our management from our core business. 
 
We do not have a principal office. Our mailing address is 6955 North Durango, Suite 1115-129, Las Vegas, NV, 89149, telephone (702) 527-2942. Our website is www.lingeriefc.com.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
As a result of the LFC Acquisition, we are seeking to develop our business (through our wholly owned subsidiary) of organizing, promoting, producing, commercializing and distributing original entertainment events and programming to be made commercially available through live events, broadcast television, video-on-demand and digital media.
History
 
As described above, we were incorporated in Nevada on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc., and on September 16, 2013 our corporate name was changed to Cala Energy Corp., (formally, Xodtec LED, Inc.) under which we were engaged in the business of offering services, such as enhanced oil recovery and material supplies, to gas and oil fields predominantly located in Southeast Asia. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business. Since that time we have been a "shell company" as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the reverse acquisition, we have ceased to be a shell company.
 
LFC, our wholly owned subsidiary upon the closing of LFC Acquisition, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2014. Immediately after the LFC Acquisition, we elected to effectuate a short form merger between us and our newly acquired LFC subsidiary, which resulted in the merger of LFC into us with us as the remaining surviving company and the change of our name "Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc.
 
THE SHARE EXCHANGE AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 
The LFC Acquisition
 
On March 31, 2015 (the "Closing Date"), the Company, LFC, and the shareholders and the holders of Convertible Notes of LFC (each, a "LFC Shareholder" and together the "LFC Shareholders") entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we exchanged 16,750,000 shares of our Common Stock for (i) 11,500,000 shares of LFC Common Stock, and (ii) the Convertible Notes of LFC which were automatically convertible upon a merger into 5,250,000 shares of LFC Common Stock, as a result of which LFC has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and we became an operating Company.

LFC is a media company focused on the development, production, promotion and distribution of original entertainment which we plan to make commercially available predominantly through live entertainment events, as well as through digital home video, broadcast television networks, video-on-demand and digital media channels. As a result, we have ceased to be a shell company. Effective as of April 1, 2015, we changed our name to "Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc.," (by virtue of the short form merger with our new LFC subsidiary) to reflect our new business focus.
 
At the closing of the LFC Acquisition, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement:
 


· | All shares of LFC Common Stock (including shares of LFC Common Stock issuable upon conversion of certain LFC Convertible Notes) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the LFC Acquisition were exchanged on a one-for-one basis into an aggregate of 16,750,000 shares of our Common Stock or approximately 84.70% of our outstanding Common Stock;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The investors in our PPO financing upon the closing of the LFC Acquisition acquired an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock or approximately 12.65% of our outstanding Common Stock for gross offering proceeds of $200,000; 
· | The 424,977 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the LFC Acquisition and PPO financing, now only reflect approximately 2.65% of our outstanding Common Stock as a result of the said transactions; 

 
As of the effective date of the LFC Acquisition, the LFC Shareholders (which, for the avoidance of doubt includes the holders of Convertible Notes) received 84.70% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, pursuant to which each such LFC Shareholder was entitled his or her pro-rata portion thereof. The remaining 15.30% of such shares are held as follows; (i) the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the closing of the LFC Acquisition retained approximately 2.65% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, pursuant to which each such Company shareholder was entitled to his or her pro-rata portion thereof and (ii) the five investors in the PPO financing received 12.65% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
 
The Equity Financing
 
Concurrently with the closing of the LFC Acquisition, we consummated the closing of a private placement offering (the "PPO") for the sale of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock, at an offering price of $0.08 per share, to certain accredited investors and non-U.S. Persons pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement between us and the subscribers to the PPO. The closing of the LFC Acquisition was a condition precedent to the closing of the PPO. The PPO offering was fully subscribed for by five investors with $36,000 of the proceeds allocated towards the repayment of our indebtedness.
 
Departure and Appointment of Directors and Officers
 
Our board of directors of the Company (the "Board") immediately prior to the LFC Acquisition consisted of one (1) member, Terry Butler, who also served as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer since July 2012 ("Butler").
 
Upon closing of the LFC Acquisition, Butler remained as director and Chief Financial Officer and was appointed by the Board to serve as the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, and Shaun Donnelly, the principal officer and founder of LFC, was elected by the Board to serve as a director, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. In 2016, Terry Butler resigned as director and Chief Financial Officer and no longer serves on the Board as the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company.

In October 2016, LFC hired Charles Connaughton as its Chief Financial Officer position. On May 4, 2017, Charles Connaughton resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective immediately. The Company’s Board of Directors accepted Mr. Connaughton resignation. Effective May 4, 2017, Shaun Donnelly, our current Chief Executive Officer, will replace Mr. Connaughton as interim Chief Financial Officer until a suitable replacement is found.
 
Lock-up Agreements and Other Restrictions
 
Certain LFC Shareholders, namely, Mohammed Ismail ("Ismail"), Stephen J. Ureczky ("Ureczky"), as well as Michelle C. Blanchard ("Blanchard" and, together with Ismail and Ureczky, (the "Restricted Holders") were parties to certain lock-up agreements with LFC, pursuant to which the Restricted Holders are prohibited (except in certain limited circumstances) from certain sales, short selling or dispositions of our Common Stock (the "Lock-Up Agreements") in accordance with the following (collectively, the "Lock-Up"):

Our Business
 
Our LFC business and brand is focused on building and establishing a sports entertainment league that utilizes wrestling and mixed martial arts ("MMA") fighting techniques together with fictional character personas, parodies of public figures and professional sporting leagues and fictional storylines for purposes of providing entertainment. We seek to promote and market our brand, our programming, our events and our products.
 
Our mission is to establish the popularity of our LFC league and brand based on the future success of our athletes, fictional character personas and other entertainment value. Our uniqueness is derived from our predominantly all female league structure, where a vast array of beautiful, attractive and unique women engage in a provocatively scripted version of wrestling and MMA fighting techniques against one another for purposes of delivering high quality entertainment to mature audiences.
 
Our management believes that the LFC league and our unique approach in applying a predominantly all female league structure to wrestling and mixed martial arts gives us a substantial competitive advantage to build the popularity of the LFC league in general.
 
Parody, Satire and Drama
 
Our entertainment also involves the development of original fictional characters or settings that both directly and indirectly references other athletes, professional figures, sports entertainment leagues, athletic events and/or celebrity personas through parody and/or satire or drama with the intent to highlight and create irreverent, funny or dramatic characters and situations that mock, what we believe to be, an over-promoted pop phenomena prevalent in today's media and sports entertainment leagues.
Our Events
 
Our operations seek to be organized around the development, promotion and distribution of our live events and televised entertainment programming. We also seek to develop branding and merchandising avenues for revenues.
Live Events
 
We seek to produce and market our first live entertainment event in Las Vegas, NV, and intend expand our entertainment events into other cities and states. Our live events will capture scripted and choreographed live action fight sequences, as well as pre-fight and post-fight reports, to be recorded and edited by our in-house production team and serve as the live action fictional content for our video and television programming. It is intended that these live events will be promoted through a variety of media outlets, including television, radio, print, the Internet and local grass roots marketing efforts.

9

 
To date, we have conducted one live entertainment event and continue to promote the LFC brand through our various YouTube® channels, advertising videos and other related promotional materials.
 
We launched our first full regular season of the LFC sporting events in May of 2015, which took place in Nevada. Since than we have held events in California, North Dakota and Internationally in Bratislava, Slovakia. We will continue to work on obtaining contracts with both our current and prospective entertainers.
 
Video Programming
 
We are an independent producer of video programming for digital home video and intend to develop such video programming for broadcast television, cable television, pay-per-view and video-on-demand markets. We produce scripted style fights featuring attractive and athletic females of the LFC league clothed in lingerie. Our featured episodes, called the Lingerie Fighting Championships, will include live action content stylized and modeled in the format of a reality television series.
 
Each episode will be 120 minutes in length and features variable lengths of choreographed fight sequences, fighter vignettes and behind the scenes footage, pre-fight and post-fight commentary, as well as entertaining fictional storylines that combine drama, parody and satire.
 
Television Programming; Pay-Per View Programming
 
We will produce and own our television programming and video library and believe that pay-per-view and video-on- demand television distribution presents opportunities to generate revenue for our business. In an effort to build our LFC brand, we plan to distribute our live event programming through pay-per-view and video-on-demand television outlets in the future.
Home Video
 
We expect to pursue opportunities in the home video market by licensing, on a distribution fee and/or royalty basis our growing video library to third parties to develop, produce, manufacture, and sell DVDs for the home video market. We hope to develop a video library with proprietary material from our live events, television broadcasts, special events and behind the scenes content of live events. To date, we have developed and produced an LFC DVD entitled "Lingerie Fighting Championships: Lace vs Leather" which is currently being sold on the LFC official website (www.lingeriefc.com) as well as Amazon.com.
 
It is intended that we will continue to produce develop our video programming to be sold in DVD volume installments in retail stores and on-line via such e-commerce platforms such as the LFC official site (www.lingeriefc.com) and other third party retailers including, but not limited to, Amazon® and iTunes®. We are currently in discussion with various other retailers specializing in home video distribution. All references herein to Amazon®, iTunes®, YouTube® or Facebook® are to websites operated by such entities and we do not have any rights, affiliation or license with them other than the presence of our media or products on such media platforms as set forth herein.
 
Online Programming
 
We utilize the Internet to communicate with our fans and market and distribute our various programming. Through our network of websites and social media, our fans and customers can obtain the latest news and information on the LFC, purchase our live event tickets, home video programming, and purchase our branded merchandise. Our main site is www.lingeriefc.com. We will promote www.lingeriefc.com at our live events and on our televised programming.
 
The Company utilizes a Facebook page that has accrued a modest fan base of followers (https://www.facebook.com/lfcfighting). We also have two (2) YouTube® channels with a small, growing fan base. We will seek to hire administrative employees to administer and build our social media presence.
 


10

Branded Merchandise
 
Licensing and Direct Sales.
 
We believe that licensing of LFC names, logos and copyrighted works on a variety of retail products presents a further opportunity to generate revenues. As our brand grows, we expect to pursue greater opportunities to expand our licensing efforts through a more comprehensive licensing program.
Competition
 
Competition for Viewers. The entertainment market in which we operate has a limited fan base and is highly competitive. We must compete for the time and attention of viewers with more established content programming and entertainment value. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, accessibility, perceptions of ad load, brand awareness and reputation.
List of Competitors. Our events, we anticipate, caters to a niche audience. Our audience, we anticipate, will consist primarily of a mature audience with an appreciation of MMA and contact sports and professional wrestling. We compete with athletic events as well as mature audience entertainment. While we do pride our business model on having an athletic appeal, we do not deem ourselves as a conventional full contact sport, and our events are designed as scripted fictional entertainment. For additional details on risks related to competition for listeners, please refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors."
 
Our competitors include among others:
 


· | Sports Entertainment Providers. We compete on a national basis primarily with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "WWE") and Zuffa, LLC, the American sports promotion company specializing in mixed martial arts and parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship league (collectively, the "UFC"). We will have to compete with WWE and the UFC in many aspects of our business, including viewership, application of mixed martial arts, access to arenas, the sale and licensing of branded merchandise and distribution channels for our televised programs. We also directly compete to find, hire and retain talented performers. WWE and UFC has substantially greater financial resources than we do, and already has an established fan base and following, and are affiliated with television cable networks on which WWE's and UFC's programs are aired. Other sources of competition in our sports entertainment market are regional promoters of wrestling events.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Television Network Scheduling. Conventional sports channels may not accept us or may limit us to less popular time slots. Because we are not a conventional sports league, and due to the mature target audience for our events, mainstream sporting channels may not accept us or may limit our events to mid-day, late night or "half time" type channel slots, as opposed to prime-time televised scheduling. 
· | Other Forms of Media. We compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other forms of in- home and mobile entertainment. We rely on having a modest but growing YouTube® following. To the extent existing or potential viewers choose to watch cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Netflix, Hulu, VEVO or YouTube or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than view our LFC programming or attend our live events, these content services pose a competitive threat. 


11

Government Regulation
 
Live Events. In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require fighting leagues to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct live events. Since we are scripted and not a full contact competitive sport, we are not subject to such regulation. If rules change or if our business structure changes or if we are perceived as being an athletic full contact sport, we could become subject to such regulation. In the event that we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Television Programming. The production of television programming by independent producers is not directly regulated by the federal or state governments, but the marketplace for television programming in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings. Changes in governmental policy and private- sector perceptions could further restrict our program content and adversely affect our levels of viewership and operating results.
Online Programming. The Company intends to conduct business on the internet and will be subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks and Copyrights. We believe that intellectual property and merchandising will be material to our business and we will expend cost and effort in an attempt to develop and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties' intellectual property. A principal focus of our efforts is to protect the intellectual property relating to our originally created characters portrayed by our performers, which encompasses images, likenesses, names and other identifying indicia of these characters. We have registered the domain name www.lingeriefc.com as our website. We currently do not have any registered trademarks. We may, however, seek to register or assert common law rights with respect to the names, terms, slogans, titles and event names we have been using to date.
 
We anticipate some revenues from branding merchandise, apparel, and particularly lingerie and swimwear using both our and other licensed brands. To accomplish this, we will have to rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions, technological measures and other methods. Further, we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use of our intellectual property, seizing goods that feature unauthorized use of our intellectual property and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others' intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results. We may be the subject of trademark and copyright infringements suits from other companies that seek to protect their names or marks on the basis of similarity or dilution, and no assurance can be made that we will be able to defend such actions.
