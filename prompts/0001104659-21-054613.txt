ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risk associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
In November 2018, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,875,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. On July 13, 2020, we effected a stock split resulting in our sponsor holding 10,062,500 founder shares. On July 29, 2020, our sponsor transferred 40,000 founder shares to each of Desirée Rogers and C. Park Shaper, our independent director nominees.
 
On August 20, 2020, the company completed its initial public offering of 35,000,000 units generating gross proceeds of $350,000,000. On August 26, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 3,358,504 units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $33,585,040; thus, 472,874 shares of founder shares were forfeited. Each unit consists of one (1) share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001, and one-third (1/3) of one (1) redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one (1) share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
Concurrently with the completion of the company’s initial public offering, the sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,181,134 private placement warrants, including an additional 447,801 private placement warrants that were issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, or $10,771,701 in the aggregate. The purchase price of the private placement warrants was added to the net proceeds of the company’s initial public offering and placed in the trust account such that the trust account held $383.6 million at the time of closing of the company’s initial public offering. Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one (1) share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
On December 3, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with STPK Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of STPK (“Merger Sub”) and Stem, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Stem”). If the merger agreement is adopted by Stem’s stockholders, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of common stock of STPK (“New Stem Common Stock”) to be issued or reserved as the merger consideration, is approved by STPK’s stockholders, and the merger is subsequently completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Stem, with Stem surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of STPK (the “merger” or the “Proposed Transaction”).
 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Stem common stock, including common stock held by prior owners of Stem preferred stock (other than shares owned by Stem as treasury stock, dissenting shares and restricted shares) (“Existing Stem Common Stock”), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of approximately 65,000,000 shares of New Stem Common Stock (less any shares of New Stem Common Stock that will be issuable upon exercise of certain outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of Stem that remain outstanding after the merger).

The total number of shares of New Stem Common Stock expected to be issued in the merger at the closing of the merger is approximately 65,000,000 (including shares of New Stem Common Stock that will be issuable upon exercise of certain outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of Stem that remain outstanding after the merger), and holders of shares of Stem common stock as of immediately prior to the closing of the merger (and following the conversion of Stem preferred stock, Stem Warrants and Convertible Notes into New Stem Common Stock) will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 48% and 66.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of New Stem Common Stock immediately following the closing of the merger, assuming no shares of STPK common stock are redeemed and the maximum number of shares of STPK common stock are redeemed, respectively. We intend to list the combined company’s common stock and public warrants on the NYSE under the symbols STEM and STEM WS, respectively, upon the closing of the merger. STPK will not have units traded following closing of the merger.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including receipt of approval from stockholders of each of STPK and Stem for consummation of the merger and certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders.
 
For additional information regarding Stem, the merger agreement and transactions relating thereto, see the proxy statement/consent solicitation statement/prospectus initially filed by STPK on December 17, 2020.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify, combine with and maximize the value of a company seeking to be a market leader in, and/or benefit from the increasing global initiatives to improve the efficiency of our energy ecosystems and reduce emissions, which we refer to as the “Energy Transition”. In executing this strategy, we look for a target that (i) complements the experience of our management team and the Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group, (ii) can benefit from our team’s operating and financial expertise and (iii) represents a compelling investment opportunity for the company and our stockholders. We focus our efforts on opportunities where we feel we have a competitive advantage and are best situated to enhance the value of the business after completion of the business combination. The ultimate goal of this business strategy is to maximize stockholder value.
 
Our management team and board of directors have an extensive network of contacts that they will leverage in their efforts to identify an attractive target participating in the Energy Transition. Additionally, our management team and board of directors have worked together for over a decade. We believe this existing network and long history of working together are advantages in sourcing potential business combination targets. We also believe that our management team’s reputation, experience and track record will make us a preferred counterparty for public and private companies participating in the Energy Transition. We also believe many privately held and publicly traded companies consider Magnetar to be a trustworthy partner and recognize the firm’s ability to support value and enhance returns.
 
In addition, we believe that the breadth of the Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group’s investment activities is a competitive advantage. The Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group has experience across the energy infrastructure and renewables subsectors and has invested across the capital structure in both private and publicly traded companies. As a result, the Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group believes it has a strong understanding of key macro trends, investor expectations and market sentiment driving the Energy Transition.
 
A substantial portion of the companies involved in the Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group’s historical investments would have been attractively sized as potential targets for our initial business combination. Therefore, the Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group’s ongoing implementation of its private investment strategy could be another source of targets for our initial business combination to the extent that certain investment opportunities it reviews may not be appropriate for Magnetar’s existing investment funds, but attractive for our company.
 
Following the completion of our initial public offering, we began the process of communicating with the network of relationships of our management team, our board of directors and their affiliates to articulate the parameters for our search for a potential target initial business combination and began the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating targets for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any or all of these criteria and guidelines. We currently intend to focus on targets that we believe:

• | are well positioned to benefit from the Energy Transition, by focusing on business or sustainable solutions that contribute to or enable carbon emission reduction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have a positive environmental and social impact, taking into account stakeholders, employees and the community, without sacrificing a financial return for our stockholders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will benefit from our management team’s operating expertise, technical expertise, structuring expertise, extensive network, insight and capital markets expertise in the Energy Transition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have opportunities to grow the business organically and via third-party acquisitions, accelerating the Energy Transition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will be well received by public investors and are expected to have access to the public capital markets, including ESG-focused investors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are engaged in activities that would benefit from what our management team and Magnetar Energy & Infrastructure Group believe to be key macro trends driving the Energy Transition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are expected to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any or all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that we complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for the post- transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for seeking stockholder approval or for purposes of a tender offer, as applicable.

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Our sponsor, members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. In addition, Magnetar and its affiliates and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after the Public Offering in connection with the completion of our business combination.

Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until August 20, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by such date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by August 20, 2022.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
