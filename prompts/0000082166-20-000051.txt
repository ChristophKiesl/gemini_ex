PART I | 
ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Raven Industries, Inc. (the Company or Raven) was incorporated in February 1956 under the laws of the State of South Dakota and began operations later that same year. The Company is a diversified technology company providing a variety of products to customers within the industrial, agricultural, geomembrane, construction, commercial lighter-than-air, aerospace and defense markets. The Company markets its products around the world and has its principal operations in the United States of America. Raven began operations as a manufacturer of high-altitude research balloons before diversifying into product lines that extended from technologies and production methods of this original balloon business. The Company employs 1,362 people and is headquartered at 205 E. 6th Street, Sioux Falls, SD 57104 - telephone (605) 336-2750. The Company's Internet address is http://www.ravenind.com and its common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RAVN. The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all officers, directors and employees, which is available on its website. Information on the Company's website is not incorporated into this filing.
The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports available, free of charge, in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files these materials with, or furnishes these materials to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
These materials are also found on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. This site contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Company's current expectations and projections relating to its financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that the Company expected. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations and other important information about forward-looking statements are disclosed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Forward-Looking Statements" in this Form 10-K.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three unique operating units, or divisions, that are also its reportable business segments ("segment" or "segments"): Applied Technology Division (Applied Technology), Engineered Films Division (Engineered Films), and Aerostar Division (Aerostar). Product lines have been generally grouped in these segments based on technology, manufacturing processes, and end-use application; however, a segment may serve more than one of the product markets identified above. The Company measures profitability and performance of its segments primarily based on their operating income excluding general and administrative expenses. Other income or expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments, and assets not identifiable to an individual segment are included as corporate assets. Segment information is reported consistent with the Company's management reporting structure.
Applied Technology
Applied Technology designs, manufactures, sells, and services innovative precision agriculture products and information management tools, which are collectively referred to as precision agriculture equipment, that help farmers reduce costs, more precisely control inputs, and improve farm yields for the global agriculture market. The Applied Technology product families include application controls, GPS-guidance steering systems, field computers, automatic boom controls, machine automation, information management tools, and injection systems. Applied Technology's services include high-speed in-field Internet connectivity and cloud-based data management. 
Applied Technology sells its precision agriculture equipment to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and through aftermarket distribution partners within agricultural markets both domestically and internationally. Applied Technology competes with other technology-based companies in a number of its product families and may compete with OEMs if they develop their own product technology rather than purchase it from a third-party such as Raven. The Company's competitive advantage in this segment is designing and selling innovative, reliable, easy-to-use, and value-add products that are supported by an industry-leading service and support team.

The Company's Applied Technology Division continues to build-out its Slingshot® communications platform. Slingshot improves logistics, communications, and application execution, driving business efficiencies for its agriculture retail partners. In January 2019, Applied Technology acquired the assets of AgSync, Inc. (AgSync), an agriculture logistics software company. This acquisition enhanced the division's Slingshot platform by delivering a logistics solution for ag retailers, custom applicators, and enterprise farms. 
The Company announced Raven Autonomy™ as a strategic growth initiative in November 2019 and added machine automation as a new product family in fiscal 2020. Raven Autonomy™ is the Company's expansion of its existing machine control technology through autonomous smart machine platforms and implements used in farming. Raven Autonomy™ is expected to enable the Company's Applied Technology Division to become an industry leader in autonomous agricultural solutions. The Company began executing on this strategic growth initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 by acquiring Smart Ag, Inc. (Smart Ag®) and a majority ownership in Dot Technology Corp. (DOT®). 
Engineered Films
Engineered Films produces high-performance plastic films and sheeting for geomembrane, agricultural, construction, and industrial applications and also offers design-build and installation services of these plastic films and sheeting. Plastic film and sheeting can be purchased separately or together with installation services.
Engineered Films has various fabrication facilities in the United States to provide a heightened level of service and faster product delivery to customers of its energy, geomembrane and construction products. In January 2020, the division expanded its fabrication capabilities through leasing a facility on the East Coast in Waynesboro, Virginia.
Engineered Films sells direct to end-customers and through independent third-party distributors. The majority of products sold into the construction and agriculture markets are sold through distributors, while sales into the geomembrane and industrial markets are generally sold to end customers. The Company extrudes a significant portion of the film converted for its commercial products and believes it is one of the largest sheeting converters in the United States in the markets it serves. Engineered Films' ability to extrude and convert films, along with offering installation services for its geomembrane products, allows it to provide a more customized solution to customers. A number of film manufacturers compete with the Company on both price and product availability. 
In November 2019, the Company announced Raven Composites™ as a strategic growth platform for Engineered Films. Raven Composites™ is expected to build on the division's core strengths and expand Engineered Films to become an industry leader in the adjacent reinforced composites market. By leveraging the division's reinforced materials expertise, Engineered Films plans to focus on innovative solutions that deliver thinner, lighter and stronger composites within the construction, industrial, and transportation markets.
Aerostar
Aerostar serves the aerospace and defense and commercial lighter-than-air markets. Aerostar's core products include high-altitude stratospheric platforms, technical services, and radar systems. These products can be integrated with additional third-party sensors to provide research, communications, and situational awareness capabilities to governmental and commercial customers. Aerostar’s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products in these markets. Aerostar also pursues product and support services contracts with U.S. government agencies as well as sales of advanced radar systems in international markets.

Aerostar sells to government agencies as both a prime contractor and subcontractor and to commercial users primarily as a sub-contractor. Sales to government agencies often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties and protracted negotiation processes. The timing and size of contract wins can create volatility in Aerostar’s financial performance. Aerostar competes with other technology companies that specialize in aerospace and defense products and services based on price, performance, and service.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
Despite end-market challenges in the North American ag and energy markets, along with significantly lower hurricane recovery film sales, the Company achieved positive financial results while investing strategically for long-term growth. Applied Technology and Aerostar grew sales year-over-year through continued advancements of their products and services.
During fiscal 2020, Applied Technology continued its growth in sales despite the ongoing ag market challenges in North America caused by the historically wet spring planting conditions. The division achieved year-over-year growth led by the strength of its innovative product portfolio. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the division completed the acquisition of Smart 
4 



Ag and the acquisition of a majority ownership in DOT. These acquisitions will support Raven Autonomy™, one of the Company's strategic platforms for growth that was announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Both Smart Ag and DOT are in the technological development stage. The Company plans to commercialize its first Raven Autonomy™ products in fiscal 2021. Initial revenues are expected to be modest in the first year of commercialization. To support these commercialization efforts and further development of semi-autonomous and autonomous solutions for agriculture, Applied Technology expects to invest approximately $15 million in research and development (R&D) and selling activities in fiscal 2021. The division previously planned to invest approximately $20 million in such activities in fiscal 2021, but has tempered its plans in light of the current economic environment. The division will also recognize approximately $3 million in acquisition-related amortization expense in fiscal 2021. The Company believes the division is well positioned to execute on its long-term strategy during fiscal 2021 by leveraging these acquisitions and increasing investment in R&D to provide a strong cadence of new product innovation delivered to the market. While the global economic environment will impact the ag market, the division's underlying historical business has a very strong product offering which generates compelling returns for its end customers.
Engineered Films experienced a challenging energy market and significantly lower hurricane recovery film sales, which led to a year-over-year decline in sales and division profit. Hurricane recovery film sales were down, as expected, over $12 million year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company announced Raven Composites™ as a strategic platform for growth in Engineered Films. In fiscal 2021, the Company plans to make modest investments in Raven Composites™ through investments in capital equipment to advance greenfield operations. An aggressive acquisition strategy, with a cadence of at least one acquisition a year, was envisioned for Raven Composites™ when this strategic platform was launched in November 2019. While the Company fully expects to execute on acquisitions to spring-board growth in the composites market, these will likely be delayed until fiscal 2022 given the unprecedented uncertainties currently impacting the global economy. As a result of the planned investments, the Company is anticipating initial revenues from Raven Composites™ to begin in the second half of fiscal 2021. Initial revenues will be modest and will be targeted in the construction, industrial, and transportation markets. For Engineered Films' core business, the Company is expecting continued challenges in the geomembrane market (specifically in the energy sub-market) as recent global economic developments have significantly impacted oil prices and are expected to drive reductions in domestic drilling activities. The division's diverse market exposure will help insulate it from certain market dynamics, and the division is prepared for challenging end-market conditions.
Aerostar executed on its core stratospheric platforms and radar systems, driving increases in net sales and division profit of 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively. In fiscal 2020, Aerostar was also awarded two aerostat contracts totaling approximately $10 million. The division will be executing on these aerostat contract wins while further advancing its technical engineering services and products for its stratospheric platforms and radar systems. The division expects to build on its strong performance and achieve growth in fiscal year 2021.
With the global economic uncertainties, the concern among market participants is growing, and the likelihood of a global economic slowdown for the next several months is high. How extensive and how long this will persist are indeterminable, but the Company is well positioned to respond to the challenges this is creating. With diverse end-markets, strong competitive positions, healthy operating margins, and a solid balance sheet and cash flow, the Company is in a strong relative position. The Company will effectively manage the short-term uncertainties and financial performance, while continuing to fund its strategic platforms for growth, although not nearly as aggressively as the Company had planned prior to the recent events. 
Despite the uncertainties, the Company expects to make significant progress on its multi-year plan to drive a step-change in its long-term growth by supplementing its existing core businesses with a significantly increased level of investment focused on Raven Autonomy™ and Raven Composites™ over the next five years. However, given the current global economic uncertainties, the Company is going to take a more measured approach in fiscal 2021. As a result, Raven Autonomy™ will be prioritized for investment, while investment in Raven Composites™ will be more modest and likely not include an acquisition in the next nine months. 
Given the significance of the planned investments, it is expected that margins will be lower in the near term while Raven Autonomy™ and Raven Composites™ are established and sales increase, especially over the next two fiscal years. These investments are expected to drive substantial growth in sales and earnings over the long-term, beginning in fiscal year 2023. Overall, the Company's investments in manufacturing capacity and technology development, together with a strong balance sheet, position the Company for enhanced long-term growth. The Company's long-term strategic goal is to generate annual earnings growth of more than 10 percent.
Due to the global pandemic impacting business, the Company expects fiscal 2021 to be an interesting year with unique opportunities and challenges. The Company is in a unique position to capitalize on significant opportunities in the marketplace 
5 



by advancing Raven Autonomy™ and Raven Composites™ but will moderate its approach to align with market conditions. The Company faces great uncertainty given the significant global economic concerns facing all companies. As a result, the Company will be emphasizing the following four strategic priorities: uphold the Raven Way in all decisions, emphasize cash flow and liquidity from a position of strength, protect the core business and the Company's strong market positions, and continue to invest in Raven Autonomy™, a strategic platform with tremendous long-term growth potential. The Company will prudently monitor and respond to whatever short-to-intermediate term economic conditions faced to ensure continued long-term success.
MAJOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION
No customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018. 
SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Some seasonal demand exists in both the Applied Technology and Engineered Films divisions, primarily due to their respective exposure to the agricultural market. However, given the overall diversification of the Company, the seasonal fluctuations in net working capital (accounts receivable, net plus inventories less accounts payable) are not usually significant.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The principal financial instruments the Company maintains include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable equity securities (related to the Company's deferred compensation plan liability), accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and acquisition-related contingent payments. The Company manages the interest rate, credit, and market risks associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and establishment of appropriate allowances in accordance with Company policies. 
The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency balance sheet risk. The use of these financial instruments has had no material effect on consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
The Company obtains a wide variety of materials from numerous domestic and international vendors. Principal materials include electronic components for Applied Technology and Aerostar, various polymeric resins for Engineered Films, and fabrics and film for Aerostar. Engineered Films has experienced volatile resin prices over the past three years. Price increases, reflecting increased material costs or tariffs, could not always be passed on to customers due to weak demand and/or a competitive pricing environment. Predicting future raw material cost volatility and the related potential impact on the Company is not easily estimated and the Company is unable to do so to the degree required to build reliance on such forecasts.
PATENTS
The Company owns a number of patents and also owns licenses that allow the Company to gain access to certain patents of other companies. The Company does not believe that its business, as a whole, is materially dependent on any one patent or related group of patents. The Company focuses its significant R&D efforts to develop technology-based offerings. As such, the protection of the Company’s intellectual property is an important strategic objective. Along with an aggressive posture toward patenting new technology and protecting trade secrets, the Company has restrictions on the disclosure of its technology to industry and business partners to ensure that its intellectual property is maintained and protected.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The three business segments conduct ongoing R&D efforts to improve their product offerings and develop new products. R&D investment is particularly strong within Applied Technology and Aerostar. New technology development and product enhancements within Applied Technology are a competitive differentiator and central to its long-term strategy. Engineered Films also utilizes R&D spending to develop new products, value engineer, and reformulate its current products. These R&D investments deliver high-value film solutions to the markets it serves, lower raw material consumption, and improve quality of existing product lines. Aerostar's investment in the development of new technology has a particular emphasis on its core stratospheric balloon and radar platforms. The Company's total R&D costs are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company believes that, in all material respects, it is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Expenditures incurred in the past relating to compliance for operating facilities have not significantly affected the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company is unaware of any potential liabilities as of January 31, 2020, for any environmental matters that would have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
BACKLOG
The Company's backlog represents open customer orders and funded portions of signed government contracts. As of February 1, 2020, the Company's backlog totaled approximately $60 million. Backlog amounts as of February 1, 2019 and 2018, were approximately $38 million and $40 million, respectively. Because the length of time between order and shipment varies considerably by segment and customers can change delivery schedules or potentially cancel orders, the Company does not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period. However, the Company expects that any revenue generated from its backlog, as of February 1, 2020, will be recognized during fiscal year 2021.
EMPLOYEES 
As of January 31, 2020, the Company had 1,362 employees (including temporary workers). A summary by segment of these active employee include the following: Applied Technology - 497; Engineered Films - 476; Aerostar - 270; and Corporate Services - 119. Management believes employee relations are good.
