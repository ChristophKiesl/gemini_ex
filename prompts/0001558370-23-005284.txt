ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Timber Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of treatments for orphan dermatologic diseases. Our investigational therapies have proven mechanisms-of-action backed by decades of clinical experience and well-established CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and control) and safety profiles. We are initially focused on developing non-systemic treatments for rare dermatologic diseases including congenital ichthyosis (“CI”), including X-linked recessive CI (“XLRI”) and autosomal recessive CI (“ARCI”) and other sclerotic skin diseases. Our lead late-stage program is TMB-001. TMB-003 is our earliest stage program.
Products
TMB-001
TMB-001, a patented topical formulation of isotretinoin using our patented IPEG™ delivery system, completed its Phase 2b clinical trial (the “CONTROL study”) in the fourth quarter of 2021 for the treatment of moderate to severe subtypes of

​

CI, a group of rare genetic keratinization disorders that lead to dry, thickened, and scaling skin. This study demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in targeted and overall severity of CI along with a favorable safety profile. The efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of TMB-001 is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 ASCEND clinical trial (the “ASCEND study”). A prior Phase 1/2 study involving 19 patients with CI demonstrated safety and a signal of preliminary efficacy of TMB-001, as well as minimal systemic absorption. The FDA (through its Orphan Products Grant program) awarded us a $1.5 million grant to support clinical trials evaluating TMB-001. 
On October 7, 2021, we announced the completion of our Phase 2b trial in CI. The Phase 2b CONTROL study was a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of TMB-001 (0.05% and 0.1% isotretinoin) for the treatment of two distinct subtypes of moderate-to-severe CI XLRI and autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (“ARCI”) in patients (n=33) nine years old or older. Subjects applied TMB-001 twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the reduction of targeted ichthyosis severity, determined by a 50 percent or greater reduction in the validated Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity (“VIIS”) scaling score (or VIIS-50), a clinically meaningful change. Secondary endpoints included reduction in overall ichthyosis severity, as measured by a two-point improvement using the (“IGA”) scale, also considered to be a clinically relevant improvement. The study was not designed or powered for statistical analysis of the endpoints and was intended to provide information for future development. 
Top-line results including descriptive statistics are described below:

● | In the per protocol (the “PP”) population, 100 percent (nominal p= .04) and 40 percent (nominal p= ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved VIIS-50 compared to 40 percent in the vehicle group.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the intent to treat (the “ITT”) population, 64 percent (nominal p= 0.17) and 40 percent (nominal p= ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved VIIS-50 compared to 33 percent in the vehicle group.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the PP population, 100 percent (nominal p=.002) and 60 percent (nominal p=ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved a ≥2 point improvement in the IGA at week 12 compared to 10 percent in the vehicle group.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the ITT population, 55 percent (nominal p=.02) and 40 percent (nominal p=ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved a ≥2 point improvement in the IGA at week 12 compared to 8 percent in the vehicle group.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TMB-001 was generally well tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events (“AEs”) across treatment groups. The most frequent AEs were local adverse effects common for such topical treatments. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (“SAE”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On February 3, 2022, we announced the successful completion of an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA that resulted in a clear path to progress to a pivotal Phase 3 study for TMB-001. The clinical development program for TMB-001 includes a Phase 3 study with an efficacy arm and a maximum use pharmacokinetic arm as well as a smaller bridging study required to bridge to the oral reference product. Based on FDA feedback at the End-of-Phase 2 meeting, we initiated the pivotal Phase 3 ASCEND study of TMB-001 0.05% in the second quarter of 2022. The primary endpoint is the comparison of proportions of subjects with a ≥2 point change from the baseline in IGA-scaling and fissuring scores in the treatment area at 12 weeks between TMB-001 0.05% and vehicle-treated subjects. Secondary endpoints include the reduction in overall ichthyosis severity. On June 23, 2022, we announced that the first four patients had been enrolled in the Phase 3 ASCEND study. We expect to complete enrollment of the Phase 3 ASCEND study by September 2023 and to publish top-line data by May 2024.

​

In March 2022, a third party presented a late-breaking presentation of a sub-analysis of our Phase 2b CONTROL study that evaluated TMB-001 at the American Academy of Dermatology 2022 Annual Meeting. The sub-type analysis found that TMB-001 0.05% demonstrated a substantially greater proportion of patients achieving VIIS-50 and ≥2-grade IGA improvement compared with vehicle regardless of subtype. Among enrolled patients (TMB-001 0.05% [n=11], 0.1% [n=10], and vehicle [n=12]), 55% had ARCI and 45% XLRI subtypes.
In April 2022, the FDA granted fast track designation to TMB-001 for the treatment of XLRI and ARCI-LI.
In May 2022, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to TMB-001 for the treatment of CI.
In June 2022, the Korean Intellectual Property Office issued a patent covering TMB-001 Korean Patent Number: 10-2406880. Additional patents are pending for TMB-001 in several other countries.
On June 30, 2022, we received a notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application covering TMB-001 (Application Number: 16/875,710) covering claims to the uses and methods of treating congenital ichthyosis and administering isotretinoin.
In July 2022, we filed a U.S. continuation patent application covering claims to additional subject matter for TMB-001.
In October 2022, the European Commission granted orphan designation for TMB-001 for the treatment of ARCI. The European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) Pediatric Committee also provided positive comments on the Pediatric Investigation Plan for the treatment of ARCI and XLRI. We plan to respond to the Pediatric Committee and expect a final discussion in the second quarter of 2023, which is a prerequisite for filing a Marketing Authorization Application with the EMA.
In February 2023, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation for TMB-001 for the treatment of XLRI.
​
In March 2023, a sub-analysis of the Phase 2b CONTROL study was published online in Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (“CED”), the educational journal of the British Association of Dermatologists. The sub-analysis was designed to assess whether the efficacy and safety of TMB-001 differed between subjects with ARCI and XLRI. Results show that treatment with TMB-001 demonstrated greater proportions of participants achieving the primary and key secondary endpoints versus vehicle regardless of the subtype of CI.
​
​
TMB-003
The earliest stage product in our pipeline is TMB-003, a proprietary formulation of Sitaxsentan, a new chemical entity in the U.S., which is a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist. It is currently in preclinical development as a locally applied formulation for the treatment of sclerotic skin diseases. The two disease areas under consideration include Lichen Sclerosis a rare chronic disease of vulvae and perianal areas, and Localized Scleroderma, a chromic connective tissue disease that also affects other organ systems.
On January 12, 2021, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for TMB-003, our locally delivered formulation of Sitaxsentan, for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. We are planning to pursue additional orphan drug designations in other indications in the future.
BPX-01 and BPX-04
In connection with the merger with BioPharmX Corporation on May 18, 2020, we acquired the BPX-01 and BPX-04 assets. BPX-01 is a Phase 3 ready topical minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris. BPX-04 is a Phase 3 ready topical minocycline for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. On September 15, 2020, we announced that we had received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for a patent application

​

covering BPX-01 and BPX-04 (U.S. Patent Application No.: 16/514,459) and the application subsequently issued on January 5, 2021, as U.S. 10,881,672. We are seeking to monetize these assets through a license, co-development, or sale.
Material Agreements
Asset Purchase Agreements with Patagonia Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Patagonia”)
TMB-001
On February 28, 2019, we acquired the intellectual property rights for a topical formulation of isotretinoin for the treatment of CI and identified as TMB-001, formerly PAT-001 including the IPEGTM brand, from Patagonia which we refer to as the TMB-001 Acquisition, pursuant to the Asset Acquisition Agreement. Zachary Rome, a former member of our board of directors and our former Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer serves as President of Patagonia and also maintains an ownership interest therein.
Under the terms of the TMB-001 Acquisition, we paid a one-time upfront payment of $50,000 to Patagonia. Patagonia is entitled to up to $27.0 million of cash milestone payments relating to certain regulatory and commercial achievements of the TMB-001 Acquisition, with the first being $4.0 million from the initiation of a Phase 3 pivotal trial, as agreed with the FDA and defined as the first patient enrolled in such trial for the product. The next milestone payments relate to (i) a one-time payment of $7.0 million upon FDA approval of an NDA related to the product for the treatment of CI, or a substantially similar indication, and (ii) a one-time payment of $2.0 million upon EMA approval of an MMA related to the product for the treatment of CI, or a substantially similar indication. In addition, Patagonia is entitled to net sales earn-out payments ranging from low single digits to mid-double digits for the program licensed. We are responsible for all development activities under the agreement. The first regulatory and commercial milestone occurred in June 2022, as the first patient enrolled in the Phase 3 pivotal trial for the product and as such a $4.0 million milestone payment was accrued at June 30, 2022. There were no further milestone payments accrued at December 31, 2022, because the potential regulatory and commercial milestones were not considered probable.
On July 20, 2022, we entered into the Amendment to the Asset Acquisition Agreement with Patagonia, pursuant to which we and Patagonia extended the time for our payment of the first milestone payment, which became payable in the third quarter of 2022 upon the commencement of patient enrollment in our Phase 3 ASCEND clinical trial in the second quarter of 2022. The first milestone payment became payable by us in two tranches, with $2.25 million due by September 1, 2022, and $2.065 million due by September 1, 2023. The first milestone payment was made on September 1, 2022. We are accreting interest on the second tranche. The interest is recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In addition to the remedies for breach under the Asset Acquisition Agreement, including reversion under certain circumstances, we granted Patagonia a security interest in TMB-001 and certain other assets until the second milestone payment has been paid in full. Because the milestone payments due upon the achievement of certain events would be payable prior to the time in which we are able to generate revenue, such obligations under the Asset Acquisition Agreement, as amended, may impact the economic viability of developing and marketing TMB-001.
TMB-003
On June 26, 2019, we acquired the intellectual property rights for a locally administered formulation of Sitaxsentan for the treatment of cutaneous fibrosis and/or pigmentation disorders, and identified as TMB-003, formerly PAT-S03, from Patagonia (the “TMB-003 Acquisition”).
Upon closing of the TMB-003 Acquisition, we paid a one-time upfront payment of $20,000 to Patagonia. Patagonia is entitled to up to $10.25 million of cash milestone payments subject to adjustments relating to certain regulatory and commercial achievements of TMB-003, with the first being a one-time payment of $250,000 upon the opening of an investigational new drug (“IND”) with the FDA. In addition, Patagonia is entitled to net sales earn-out payments ranging from low to mid-single digits for the program licensed. We are responsible for all development activities under the agreement. The potential regulatory and commercial milestones are not yet considered probable, and no milestone

payments have been accrued at December 31, 2022 or 2021, respectively. Because the milestone payments due upon the achievement of certain events would be payable prior to the time in which we are able to generate revenue, such obligations under the agreement may impact the economic viability of developing and marketing TMB-003.
Acquisition and Termination of License from AFT Pharmaceuticals Limited (“AFT”)
On July 5, 2019, we entered into a license agreement with AFT which provided us with (i) an exclusive license to certain licensed patents, licensed know-how and AFT trademarks to commercialize a proprietary topical formulation of rapamycin marketed under the brand name Pascomer (“Pascomer”) in the United States, Canada and Mexico and (ii) a co-exclusive license to develop Pascomer in this territory. Concurrently, we granted to AFT an exclusive license to commercialize Pascomer outside of its territory and co-exclusive sublicense to develop and manufacture the licensed product for commercialization outside of its territory (the “AFT License Agreement”).
On July 22, 2022, we provided written notice to AFT of our decision to terminate the AFT License Agreement because we believed there was no longer a commercially reasonable path to approval and commercialization for the Pascomer product in the United States. Additionally, following the receipt and analysis of topline data for the Phase II Clinical Trial (as defined in the AFT License Agreement) it was determined that the study failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. Under the AFT License Agreement, we were required to provide 120 days’ prior written notice of termination to AFT which was waived by AFT on July 25, 2022 (the “Termination Date”). On the Termination Date, the rights and licenses to Pascomer reverted to AFT, among other things, as set forth in the AFT License Agreement.
Letter Agreement with TardiMed Sciences LLC (“TardiMed”)
We previously had shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as to which the holder, TardiMed, had demanded redemption. Michael Derby, our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chairman of our board of directors is the Managing Member of TardiMed. The redemption price was equal to approximately $2.1 million in the aggregate, at December 31, 2021, including accumulated and unpaid dividends which accrue at the rate of 8% per annum. Redemption was subject to certain limitations under Delaware corporate law due to our financial condition. As a result of the call for redemption, the Series A Preferred Stock had been reclassified as a liability at December 31, 2021. Dividends continued to accrue and were recorded as non-cash interest expense in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss rather than to additional-paid-in-capital in 2022. 
On July 27, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement with TardiMed (the “Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which TardiMed agreed to exchange its 1,819 shares of Series A Preferred Stock plus accrued dividends for a pre-funded warrant to purchase 181,083 shares of common stock (the “TardiMed Warrant”). The number of shares underlying the TardiMed Warrant was based on the redemption price of the Series A Preferred Stock (which had been demanded by TardiMed) divided by $11.95, the last closing price of the common stock prior to the date the Letter Agreement was executed.
Twenty percent of the TardiMed Warrant was immediately exercisable upon issuance. Beginning on September 30, 2022, and then at the end of each subsequent calendar quarter upon written request of TardiMed, we have agreed to allow an additional 20% of the initial balance of the TardiMed Warrant to become exercisable, provided that only 20% of the initial balance of the TardiMed Warrant will be exercisable in any given quarter. The TardiMed Warrant’s exercise price is $0.005 and may be exercised on a cashless basis. The TardiMed Warrant will terminate when exercised in full. As of March 25, 2023, 60% of the TardiMed Warrant has been exercised on a cashless basis and an aggregate of 108,476 shares of common stock have been issued to TardiMed.

​

offering, issuance and sale of shares of our common stock and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, and accompanying warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. After giving effect to the sale of additional shares pursuant to the exercise of the option by Wainwright that closed on November 9, 2021, the total number of shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents) sold by us in the offering was 539,063, together with warrants to purchase up to 539,063 shares of common stock (the “November Warrants”) issued at the closing on November 5, 2021, for total gross proceeds of $17.25 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, and net proceeds of approximately $15.8 million. 
​
Each share of common stock and pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock was sold together with a
warrant to purchase one share of common stock. All the securities sold in the offering were sold by us. The public offering price of each share of common stock and accompanying the November Warrant was $32.00 and $31.95 for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying November Warrant. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $0.05 per share of common stock and were exercised in full on November 5, 2021. The November Warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $35.00 per share of common stock and expire five years from the date of issuance. No November Warrants have been exercised as of December 31, 2022.
​
August 2022 Offering
On March 1, 2022, we entered into an engagement agreement, as subsequently amended on June 30, 2022 (the “Engagement Agreement”), with Wainwright, pursuant to which Wainwright agreed to act as the exclusive placement agent on a reasonable best efforts basis in connection with a public offering of common stock.
On August 4, 2022, we announced the pricing of the public offering (the “August 2022 Offering”) of (i) 931,667 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 401,667 shares of common stock and (iii) common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock (the “August Warrants”). Each share of common stock and pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock was sold together with an August Warrant to purchase one share of common stock. All of the securities sold in the August 2022 Offering were sold by us. The public offering price of each share of common stock and accompanying August Warrant was $6.00 and $5.995 for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying August Warrant. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $0.005 per share of common stock and were exercisable at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full. The August Warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share of common stock and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and the accompanying August Warrants, were issued separately and were immediately separable upon issuance. The August 2022 Offering closed on August 8, 2022. All of the pre-funded Warrants were exercised, and none remain outstanding at December 31, 2022.
In connection with the August 2022 Offering, on August 4, 2022, we entered into securities purchase agreements (the “August Purchase Agreements”) with certain institutional investors in the August 2022 Offering. The net proceeds to us from the August 2022 Offering were approximately $6.9 million, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us, excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the August Warrants. We intend to use the net proceeds from the August 2022 Offering for research and development, including clinical trials, working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, 1,309,333 shares of common stock remain issuable upon the exercise of the August Warrants.
October 2022 Offering
On October 3, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “October Purchase Agreement”) with several institutional accredited investors (the “October Investors”) to sell, in a registered direct offering (the “Registered Offering”) (i) 260,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) Series 1 common warrants (the “Series 1 Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 260,000 shares of common stock (the “Series 1 Warrant Shares”). The Series 1 Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and will expire two and one-half years following the initial exercise date. The October Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and agreements of us and the October Investors, and customary indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. Total gross proceeds from

​



​

the Registered Offering, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other estimated offering expenses, was $1.3 million. The Registered Offering closed on October 3, 2022.
In a concurrent private placement (the “Concurrent Private Placement Offering” and, together with the Registered Offering, the “October 2022 Offerings”) we also agreed to issue (i) Series 2 common warrants (the “Series 2 Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 260,000 shares of underlying common stock (the “Series 2 Warrant Shares”), and (ii) 13,000 shares of Series B Mirroring Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”).
Each share of Series B Preferred Stock had a stated value of $0.001 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock had super voting rights on the approval of the 2022 Reverse Stock Split (as defined below) equal to 10,000,000 votes per share of Series B Preferred Stock. The voting rights of the Series B Preferred Stock were established in order to maintain our NYSE American listing by raising the average minimum bid price of the common stock to over $0.20 for 30 consecutive trading days. Upon the effectiveness of the Certificate of Amendment (as defined below), the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were automatically transferred to us and cancelled for no consideration with no action on behalf of the holders thereof and such shares resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and were no longer designated as shares of Series B Stock.
The Series 2 Warrants are exercisable on the date six (6) months following the date of issuance at an exercise price of $6.00 per share and will expire two and one-half years following the initial exercise date. The Series B Preferred Stock was not, and the Series 2 Warrants and Series 2 Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Series 2 Warrants have not been, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and were offered pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.
As compensation to Wainwright, as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the Registered Offering, we paid Wainwright a cash fee of 6% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Registered Offering and reimbursed Wainwright for legal fees and expenses up to $40,000, non-accountable expenses of $25,000 and $15,950 for clearing expenses. In connection with the October 2022 Offerings, we received net proceeds of approximately $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, none of the Series 1 Warrants or Series 2 Warrants have been exercised.
2022 Reverse Stock Split
On November 7, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Amendment”), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which effected, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 8, 2022, a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one-for-fifty, which we refer to as the 2022 Reverse Stock Split. The 2022 Reverse Stock Split did not affect our authorized common stock of 450,000,000 shares. Proportionate adjustments were made to the conversion rate, the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the vesting, exercise or conversion of our outstanding derivative securities in accordance with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split ratio.
​
As a result of the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, every fifty shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. The 2022 Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in our equity, except to the extent that the 2022 Reverse Stock Split would have resulted in some stockholders owning a fractional share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of common stock were instead entitled to receive a proportional cash payment.

Sublease Agreement
​
We currently lease an 11,793 square foot office and laboratory space at 115 Nicholson Lane, San Jose, California. This lease expires in December 2023. On February 17, 2020, we executed a sublease agreement covering the entire space for the remaining term of the lease. The current monthly rent at this location is $37,710, which includes common area maintenance charges. The sublessee unexpectedly ceased making sublease payments in the fourth quarter of 2022 due

substantial financial difficulties. We have been working with the owner of the property to market the location. The sublessee has been found to have made multiple alterations to the location without permits or the lessor’s approval and we have received an estimate for repairs to the existing space and costs to clean the location that will approximate $150,000. This amount is recorded in accrued expenses at December 31, 2022, as an asset retirement obligation.

Background of Topical Isotretinoin (TMB-001)
We are developing a treatment for CI with our product TMB-001, a topical isotretinoin ointment. CI is a large, heterogeneous family of inherited skin disorders of cornification resulting from an abnormality of skin keratinization. The main features of the disorder are scaling and often thickening of the skin.
TMB-001 leverages our patented IPEG™ delivery system. This technology was developed to topically deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients for which a precise cutaneous distribution is essential. The IPEG™ platform utilizes specific ratios of different molecular weight polyethylene glycols to target specific dermal delivery profiles. TMB-001 was designed to maximize delivery of isotretinoin into the pathologic layers of skin while minimizing any systemic absorption.
Completed Phase 2a Multicenter, POC Study
The pilot Phase 2a multicenter, proof-of-concept study of topically applied 0.1% and 0.2% isotretinoin ointment, or TMB-001, in 19 subjects 12 years and older with CI of either the ARCI or XLRI subtypes was completed in 2018. Of the 19 subjects enrolled, 10 were randomized at baseline to the TMB-001, 0.1% Treatment Group, and 9 were randomized to TMB-001, 0.2%. In total, 12 subjects (12/19, 63.2%) completed the study and 7 subjects (7/19, 36.8%) discontinued early. Subjects who did not complete the study discontinued due to an adverse event, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the subject. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2a study was to assess the safety and tolerability of topical TMB-001. Safety was assessed based on the incidence (severity and causality) of any local and systemic adverse events (AEs); number of subjects with presence (and severity) of each individual local skin reaction (LSR): stinging/burning, pain, and pruritus, collected at each time point for each Treatment Area; vital signs at Days 29, 57, and 84; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) at Days 29, 57, and 84. 28 treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were reported in 14 (out of 19) subjects (seven out of ten for TMB-001 0.1% and 7/9 for TMB-001 0.2%). The most common TEAEs were in the General disorders and Administration Site Conditions System Organ Class (four out of ten for TMB-001 0.1% and three out of nine for TMB-001 0.2%), namely application site pruritus, application site irritation, and application site dermatitis. The majority of TEAEs were mild and deemed not related to test article in both groups. Of the 8 subjects with TEAEs that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment (e.g., application site rash, application site irritation, dermatitis contact, application site dermatitis, application site pruritus, application site folliculitis, application site pain), all had interruptions or withdrawal of the study drug. Overall, the majority of burning/stinging, pain, and pruritus local skin reactions (“LSRs”) was mild or moderate for both Treatment Areas in the 0.1% and 0.2% groups with somewhat greater directional severity in the 0.2% group. In Part 1 for both treatment groups, there was a modest increase over time in LSRs in the Treatment Area that received Active compared with the Treatment Area that received vehicle, particularly for pruritus. In Part 2, subjects who continued to apply active test article did not generally have increased LSRs, however, there was a modest increase in the proportion of subjects that received vehicle in Part 1 who reported pruritus at Day 84 in both treatment groups. Reports of severe LSRs were low, but slightly higher in the areas that were treated with Active for 12 weeks. Pruritus was the most commonly reported LSR at Baseline and post-Baseline visits. In the 0.2% group, one subject had a serious adverse event (“SAE”), namely severe mental status change and 2 TEAEs (moderate gastroenteritis norovirus and moderate Clostridium difficile colitis) that led to study discontinuation but recovered/resolved by end of study and the adverse events were all deemed not related to test article. There were no clinically significant changes from Baseline in laboratory test results and vital signs to end of study (“EOS”) laboratory test results and vital signs, save for the one subject who discontinued due to an SAE (deemed unrelated to test article; mental status change due to acute encephalopathy, most likely secondary to the side effects of multiple medications with sedative side effects) and had an increase in blood triglycerides that were deemed clinically significant at the end of the study.

The secondary objective of the study was to explore evidence of a potential efficacy signal of the active test article compared to vehicle and to explore the plasma levels of isotretinoin and tretinoin from topically applied TMB-001 with comparison to background systemic retinoid levels pre- and post-treatment. Efficacy endpoints were assessed using the IGA scale where the overall severity was assessed using a 5-point IGA scale where 0 was clear, 1 was almost clear, 2 was mild, 3 was moderate, and 4 was severe and individual clinical signs and symptoms where the overall severity of erythema, scaling, fissuring, and papulation/lichenification was graded using a 5-point scale where 0 was clear, 1 was almost clear, 2 was mild, 3 was moderate, and 4 was severe.
The below graph represents the primary measures of the change in IGA and scaling relative to baseline at Day 57 for the 0.1% concentration.

A favorable efficacy signal was further supported in Part 2 of the study where overall IGA and scaling improvement was observable in about half of the subjects initially treated with vehicle after receiving 4 weeks of treatment with TMB-001 Ointment. For the majority of subjects in both treatment groups, the active arms maintained the same IGA score at Day 84 as was observed at Day 57.
Plasma concentrations of isotretinoin and tretinoin indicated that systemic exposure was minimal within the four hours following initial application. Trough concentrations measured on Days 8, 29, 57 and 84 approximately 12 hours following the preceding dose indicated that systemic concentrations of isotretinoin and tretinoin were within range of the endogenous levels measured at Baseline prior to the first application.
Completed Pre-Clinical Studies
Dermal pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (“PK/TK”) and dermal toxicity studies for TMB-001 have been completed. The initial preclinical studies were completed with a slightly different formulation, PATP03 AN. However, following these studies, the formulation was modified and formulation PATPO3 ANR was selected for further clinical development. The permeability potential of these 2 formulations of TMB-001 Ointment, 0.2% (PATPO3 AN [prior formulation] and PATPO3 ANR [clinical formulation]) was assessed in an in vitro Franz cell assay using skin from a single volunteer and showed no significant differences in many parameters. To date, all nonclinical studies have been conducted using the PATPO3 AN formulation. The differences between PATPO3 AN and PATP03 ANR are minor and, predominantly, include the removal of ethanol and water and an adjustment of average PEG molecular weight in the clinical formulation. These changes do not represent a safety concern as the safety of high molecular weight PEGs, including those used in the clinical formulation, is well established. A series of nonclinical studies have been conducted using TMB-001 Ointment with concentrations ranging from 0.025% to 0.2% to support later stages of development (e.g., Phase 3 clinical studies) and an eventual New Drug Application. Information on all aspects of the pharmacological activity of isotretinoin is

available in published literature. The PK of isotretinoin following systemic administration have been well characterized. Absorption tends to be fairly rapid with high distribution to the liver. Transplacental distribution of isotretinoin has been established in all nonclinical species.
The repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance of TMB-001 Ointment have been evaluated in minipigs, bovine cornea, guinea pigs, and rabbits using formulation PATPO3 AN. Topical application of the formulated product (ranging from 0.05% to 0.2%) in minipigs for 90 days produced changes at the site of application only including irritation and microscopic alterations. The severity increased with increasing concentration. These types of dermal changes are consistent with those observed in patients administered a topical formulation of isotretinoin. TMB-001 Ointment did not produce serious eye damage, sensitization in guinea pigs, or phototoxicity in rabbits. As noted previously, the formulation used in the toxicity studies (PATPO3 AN) is different than the one selected for clinical development (PATPO3 ANR). The toxicity profile of isotretinoin administered via oral or other systemic routes of dosing is well characterized. Of particular concern from a safety perspective is its teratogenicity. It is important to differentiate the toxicity of isotretinoin observed following systemic (oral) dosing with that noted following topical administration. The pre-clinical data demonstrates that the low exposures to isotretinoin achieved with TMB-001 Ointment correlate with no adverse systemic effects. In comparison, the toxicity reported in the literature following oral administration, including teratogenicity, is associated with markedly higher exposures. Overall, there are no new or unique toxicities observed in animals treated with TMB-001 Ointment, 0.2%. The observations are consistent with the effects of isotretinoin.
Completed Phase 2b CONTROL Study 
We initiated a Phase 2b randomized, parallel, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in December 2019. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of topically applied TMB-001 in subjects nine years of age and older. Patients had clinical diagnosis of CI and a genetic confirmation of either ARCI-LI (e.g., transglutaminase 1-deficient) or XLRI (e.g., deletion of steroid sulfatase gene) subtypes of CI. Patients had, at baseline, an affected body surface area between a minimum of 10% and maximum of 90% that was treated.
We have analyzed the primary endpoint using a validated tool called the Visual Index of Ichthyosis Severity or VIIS that has been shared with the FDA. Common tools used to measure CI severity have either not been validated or if validated have used a very limited number of subjects and few expert graders.
The VIIS is a tool validated and published by Yale researchers for scaling and erythema. It provides detailed written descriptions for both features based on the level of severity, visual standards for 4 body sites (upper back, upper arm, lower leg/shin, and dorsal foot) in CI patients, with two distinct standards that account for different types of scale. Based on the high concordance between expert graders for the scaling score during the VIIS validation process, the primary efficacy endpoint for the proposed Phase 2b study is the change in VIIS scaling score relative to Baseline. The proportion of subjects with treatment success (VIIS-50) is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the VIIS scaling score relative to baseline at the end of study calculated in patients that have a baseline score of 3 or higher. These patients represent moderate to severe disease phenotype.
On July 1, 2020, we announced that all 11 sites across the United States and Australia in the Phase 2b CONTROL study evaluating TMB-001 in patients with moderate to severe CI were enrolling patients. As of December 31, 2020, all sites participating in a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating TMB-001 were opened and enrolling patients. On May 31, 2021, we completed patient enrollment in the Phase 2b clinical trial with 34 patients randomized. On October 7, 2021, we announced top-line data from the TMB-001 Phase 2b trial. The data demonstrated a reduction in targeted and overall severity of CI in patients treated with topical IPEG™ TMB-001 (topical isotretinoin). Top-line results including descriptive statistics are described below:

● | In the “PP population, 100 percent (nominal p = 0.04) and 40 percent (nominal p= ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved VIIS-50 compared to 40 percent in the vehicle group.

​



​


● | In the ITT population, 64 percent (nominal p =0.17) and 40 percent (nominal p =ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved VIIS-50 compared to 33 percent in the vehicle group.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the PP population, 100 percent (nominal p =0.002) and 60 percent (nominal p =ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved a ≥2 point improvement in the IGA at week 12 compared to 10 percent in the vehicle group.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the ITT population, 55 percent (nominal p =0.02) and 40 percent (nominal p =ns) of patients treated with TMB-001 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively, achieved a ≥2 point improvement in the IGA at week 12 compared to 8 percent in the vehicle group.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TMB-001 was generally well tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across treatment groups. The most frequent AEs were local adverse effects common for such topical treatments. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key characteristics of the study that we designed included measuring the efficacy of TMB-001 on two scales, the VIIS and the IGA. The VIIS assessed improvements in well-defined, affected areas to allow unambiguous dose selection for the pivotal Phase 3 trial(s) and the IGA provided a broader perspective of the disease severity and therapeutic response. Given the FDA’s historical interest in IGA, and in agreement the FDA, we also used IGA as key secondary endpoint to determine overall diseases severity at baseline, throughout the study and at the end of the study visit. IGA scores were dichotomized to “treatment success” or “treatment failure” where “treatment success” was defined as at least a 2-grade decrease in severity score relative to baseline at the end of study. The VIIS areas were included in IGA assessment so that concordance between the two end points resulted in further validation of VIIS to be used uniquely in Phase 3 with the added knowledge of its fidelity and reproducibility.
Another key aspect of the Phase 2b study was that emollients and keratolytics were not allowed in the VIIS area, or any other area where the subject was applying the study drug. This could be accomplished because TMB-001 has demonstrated good skin occlusion, hydration and lubrication so that patients did not find the need to use other emollients in the treated areas during the study. This was important as the use of these agents can confound the results
In addition, we intend to generate additional preliminary data to assess the impact of TMB-001 treatment on quality of life of CI patients and generate preliminary data to support clinical meaningfulness of TMB-001 in the lives of CI patients. To that end, an age-appropriate Dermatology Quality of Life Index (“DLQI”), which is a dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument will be used. Itch is a prominent feature in CI patients, so additionally pruritus was assessed with a self-administered Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire using the I-Numerical Rating Scale at various visits.
In March 2022, a third party presented a late-breaking presentation of a sub-analysis of our Phase 2b CONTROL study that evaluated TMB-001 at the American Academy of Dermatology 2022 Annual Meeting. The sub-type analysis found that TMB-001 0.05% demonstrated a substantially greater proportion of patients achieving VIIS-50 and ≥2-grade IGA improvement compared with vehicle regardless of subtype. Among enrolled patients (TMB-001 0.05% [n=11], 0.1% [n=10], and vehicle [n=12]), 55% had ARCI and 45% XLRI subtypes. 
In March 2023, a sub-analysis of the Phase 2b CONTROL study was published online in CED. The sub-analysis was designed to assess whether the efficacy and safety of TMB-001 differed between subjects with ARCI and XLRI. Results show that treatment with TMB-001 demonstrated greater proportions of participants achieving the primary and key secondary endpoints versus vehicle regardless of the subtype of CI.
Phase 3 ASCEND Study
In June 2022, we initiated the Phase 3 ASCEND study. The ongoing ASCEND study will evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of TMB-001 0.05%. The randomized, parallel, double-blind, vehicle-controlled ASCEND study is designed to enroll 142 participants 6 years of age or older with moderate to severe CI including XLRI and ARCI. 

14
​



​

Participants in the ASCEND study are randomized 2:1 to TMB-001 or vehicle control ointment (two participants on TMB-001 for every one participant on vehicle) for 12 weeks, at which point eligible participants in both arms of the study are randomized again to either once-a-day or twice-a-day TMB-001 treatment for an additional 12 weeks to provide valuable information on longer term treatment with the compound. The primary endpoint is the comparison of proportions of subjects with a ≥2 point change from the baseline in IGA-scaling and fissuring scores in the treatment area at 12 weeks between TMB-001 0.05% and vehicle-treated subjects. Secondary endpoints include the reduction in overall ichthyosis severity. We expect to complete enrollment of the ASCEND study by September 2023 and to publish top-line data by May 2024.
Competitive Landscape
There are currently no approved topical isotretinoin products available in the United States. We are currently aware of one other program that is active in the CI space that may compete with the TMB-001 program. 
The program in development is from Krystal Biotech, whose product KB105, is currently the subject of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of TGM1-deficient ARCI. KB105 is a replication-incompetent, non-integrating HSV-1 vector expressing human transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) formulated as a topical gel. The Phase 2 clinical trial involves a randomized, placebo-controlled intra-patient parallel study. Up to 15 children or adults, aged 6 months and older are planned for this Phase 2 study. The Phase 2 trial is expected to begin in March 2023 and finish in April 2024. As of March 2023, the trial was active but had not yet begun recruiting (NCT 05735158). It is the belief of management that the TMB-001 program is significantly more advanced the KB105 program in terms of development timelines. We believe that the TMB-001 program has additional key differentiators that we believe to be relevant including: a broader range of disease states being studied (Lamellar Ichthyosis including the TGM1 mutations but also other mutations and XLRI); a topical formulation versus gene therapy and a known mechanism of action in the disease.
Background of Locally Applied Sitaxsentan (TMB-003)
We are developing a treatment for scleroderma with our product TMB-003, locally applied Sitaxsentan. Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is a chronic connective tissue disease that is generally classified as one of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
In-Vitro, Preclinical Studies
Investigative studies of the effects of endothelin receptor selectivity on cutaneous fibrosis and pigmentation were completed in January 2018. Sitaxsentan is a highly selective (6,500:1) endothelin-A (“ET-A”) receptor antagonist developed for systemic use but never as a topical agent. Bosentan is a dual endothelin-A / endothelin-B (“ET-B” and together with ET-A, “ET-A/ ET-B”) receptor antagonist developed and available for systemic use but not as a topical agent.
The endothelins, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, are a group of peptides that act on two distinct receptor subtypes, ET-A and ET-B. Of these three peptides, ET-1 has been the most studied. ET-1 stimulates cardiac contraction and the growth of cardiac muscle cells, regulates the release of substances that affect the blood vessels, stimulates smooth muscle cell division, and may control inflammatory responses by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
In a series of studies, Sitaxsentan was found to have a significant effect on several important mechanisms of cutaneous fibrosis including its ability to reduce fibroblast migration, induce apoptosis, and reduce the amount of collagen produced. Further, Sitaxsentan outperformed Bosentan in several important mechanisms of cutaneous fibrosis. This is notable in the reduction of the amount of collagen produced in induced cells which can be compared back to un-induced controls. This suggests an inhibition in the development of a pro-fibrotic phenotype. Furthermore, enhanced apoptosis in a pro-fibrotic environment is likely beneficial, as resistance to apoptosis has been reported to be a characteristic of scleroderma fibroblasts. The results suggest that both drugs increase apoptosis compared to the control, whereby Sitaxsentan is more effective than Bosentan in stimulating apoptosis and the clearance of fibrosis-inducing cells. In both scratch assays,

​

Sitaxsentan was superior to Bosentan in preventing closure of the scratch, suggesting that hypermotility and proliferation, characteristic of scleroderma fibroblasts, could be reduced. 
Sitaxsentan was also found to decrease the production of melanin, suggesting that it could be useful in treating hyperpigmentation. The effect of Sitaxsentan in in these studies suggest it could be a useful agent in addressing conditions of cutaneous fibrosis and hyperpigmentation through a selective targeting of the endothelin-A receptors.

While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the products or processes may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a period due to delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our products or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and marketing approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulations
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

18
​



​

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Orphan Drug Pathway
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication that could be used “off-label” by physicians in the orphan indication, even though the competitor’s product is not approved in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do of the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to 

19
​



​

address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the approval application for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the approval application.
In addition, under the provisions of the FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an irreversible effect on morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has sixty days from receipt to make a decision as to whether the application has been accepted for filing.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthored, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals

for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Manufacturing and Supply
We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, and for pre-clinical and clinical studies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) eliminates the need to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs.
As we further develop our products, we expect to consider secondary or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our current needs, but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a ‘‘fee for services’’ basis based on our current development plans.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Management and our board of directors are committed to corporate responsibility and recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance issues. including hiring, promotion and development practices. Our mission as an organization is to be patient-centric and develop innovative treatments to find solutions for patients suffering from rare and underserved dermatological diseases. In particular, we are considering how to minimize our future carbon footprint when planning office renovations and will continue to focus our attention in the near term on methods of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, increasing use of renewable energy, conserving water, and reducing waste generation.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we had nine full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants with the overall goal of having an employee base that embraces teamwork and shares a focus for using each person’s individual skills, experience and expertise in order to develop and maximize the value of corporate assets, and achieve long-term revenue and earnings growth. As we build our organization, we will continue to focus on diversity, equity and inclusion across all aspects of our organization.
Other Information
We file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be obtained, free of charge, by visiting the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that contains all of the reports, proxy and information statements, and other information that we electronically file or furnish to the SEC.
