ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

OVERVIEW


NorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 734,800 customers in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. We have generated and distributed electricity in South Dakota and distributed natural gas in South Dakota and Nebraska since 1923 and have generated and distributed electricity and distributed natural gas in Montana since 2002.
We manage our businesses by the nature of services provided, and operate principally in three business segments: electric utility operations; natural gas utility operations; and all other, which primarily consists of unallocated corporate costs. Our electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission and distribution of electricity, and our natural gas utility operations include the production, purchase, transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas. Our customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. 
Our electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Our natural gas utility operations include the production, purchase, transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas. Our electric and natural gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of our largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our utility operations are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on operating performance. Consumption of electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months for cooling and heating, respectively. Because natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.

MONTANA ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Our regulated electric utility business in Montana includes generation, transmission and distribution. Our service territory covers approximately 107,600 square miles, representing approximately 73% of Montana's land area. During 2019, we delivered electricity to approximately 379,400 customers in 208 communities and their surrounding rural areas, 11 rural electric cooperatives and, in Wyoming, to the Yellowstone National Park. In 2019, by category, residential, commercial, industrial, and other sales accounted for approximately 42%, 48%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of our Montana retail electric utility revenue.

Transmission Services
In addition to delivering energy to distribution systems to serve customers, we also transmit electricity for nonregulated entities owning generation, and utilities, cooperatives, and power marketers serving the Montana electricity market. Our total control area peak demand was approximately 1,904 MWs on August 5, 2019, which set an all-time high for our balancing authority area over the record 2018 peak demand. Our control area average demand for 2019 was approximately 1,412 MWs per hour, with total energy delivered of more than 12.3 million MWHs. 
Our transmission system is directly interconnected with Avista Corporation; Idaho Power Company; PacifiCorp; the Bonneville Power Administration; WAPA; and Montana Alberta Tie Ltd. Such interconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities, permit the interchange, purchase, and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnecting with the winter-peaking northern and summer-peaking southern regions of the western power system. We provide wholesale transmission service and firm and non-firm transmission services for eligible transmission customers. Our 500 kV transmission system, which is jointly owned, along with our 230 kV and 161 kV facilities, form the key assets of our Montana transmission system. Lower voltage systems provide for local area service needs. 
Energy and Capacity Resources
The following charts depict the makeup of our current Montana portfolio. Hydro generation is by far our largest and most important resource, as it is reliable, dramatically lowers the portfolio's carbon intensity, and reduces economic risks associated with future carbon costs.

Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet our customers' future energy needs and is used to guide resource acquisition activities. We filed our latest resource plan with the MPSC in August 2019. We have significant generation capacity deficits and negative reserve margins. In addition to our responsibility to meet peak demand, national reliability standards effective July 2016 increased the need for us to have greater dispatchable generation capacity available and be capable of increasing or decreasing output to address the irregular nature of intermittent generation such as wind or solar. Our generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy and capacity resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet our obligation to serve retail customers while maintaining reliability. For a discussion of our current resource plan, the related competitive solicitation, and potential acquisition of an additional interest in Colstrip Unit 4, see the "Significant Trends and Regulation" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our annual retail electric supply load requirements average approximately 750 MWs, with a peak load of approximately 1,200 MWs, and are supplied by owned and contracted resources and market purchases with multiple counterparties. Owned generation resources supplied approximately 69% of our retail load requirements for 2019. We expect that approximately 65% of our retail obligations will be met by owned generation resources in 2020. In addition, QFs provide a total of 412 MWs of nameplate capacity, including 107 MWs from waste petroleum coke and waste coal, 272 MWs from wind, 16 MWs from hydro, and 17 MWs from solar projects, located in Montana. We have several other long and medium-term power purchase agreements including contracts for 135 MWs of wind generation and 21 MWs of seasonal base-load hydro supply. For 2020, including both owned and contracted resources, we have resources to provide over 90% of the energy requirements necessary to meet our forecasted retail load requirements. We do not receive all the Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from our contracted electric supply resources. The owner of the RECs claims the renewable attributes of the energy, and our resource mix does not represent the actual energy delivered to our customers.

Commitment to Reduction in Carbon Intensity
Over 60% of the energy we produce in Montana comes from carbon-free sources, including hydro, wind and solar. This is more than two times better than the total U.S. electric power industry (28% carbon free). In December 2019, we announced a commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our electric energy portfolio for Montana by 90 percent by 2045 as compared with our 2010 carbon intensity as a baseline.

(1) The Hebgen facility (0 MW net capacity) is excluded from the figures above. These are run-of-river dams except for Mystic, which is storage generation.

Other Facilities | Fuel Source | OwnershipInterest | MaximumCapacity (MW)
Colstrip Unit 4, located near Colstrip in southeastern Montana | Sub-bituminous coal | 30% | 222 
DGGS, located near Anaconda, Montana | Natural Gas | 100% | 150 
Spion Kop Wind, located in Judith Basin County in Montana | Wind | 100% | 40 
Two Dot Wind, located in Wheatland County in Montana | Wind | 100% | 11 

Colstrip Unit 4 provides base-load supply and is operated by Talen Montana, LLC (Talen). Talen has a 30% ownership interest in Colstrip Unit 3. We have a reciprocal sharing agreement with Talen regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, 
 11

in which each party receives 15% of the respective combined output and is responsible for 15% of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4. However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. Colstrip Unit 4 is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under a coal supply agreement in effect through 2025.
Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) enacted in Montana currently require that 15% of our annual electric supply portfolio be derived from eligible sources, including resources such as wind, biomass, solar, and small hydroelectric. Eligible resources used to serve our load generate RECs. Any RECs in excess of the annual requirements for a given year are carried forward for up to two years to meet future RPS needs. While our hydro generation assets are not eligible resources under the RPS, any qualifying additions would be eligible. Given contracts under negotiation and our portfolio resources, we expect to meet the Montana RPS requirements through the 2040s. The penalty for not meeting the RPS is up to $10 per MWH for each REC short of the requirement. 
Western Energy Imbalance Market
In November 2018, we announced our intent to enter the Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), operated by the California Independent System Operator (California ISO), in the spring of 2021. We studied the value and costs of the EIM for several years prior to the decision to participate in the Western EIM. Utilities in the western United States outside the California ISO have traditionally relied upon a combination of automated and manual dispatch within the hour to balance generation and load to maintain reliable supply. These utilities have limited capability to transact within the hour outside their balancing area. In contrast, energy imbalance markets use automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads. The Western EIM is intended to reduce power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. 

SOUTH DAKOTA ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Our South Dakota electric utility business operates as a vertically integrated generation, transmission and distribution utility. We have the exclusive right to serve an area in South Dakota comprised of 25 counties. We provide retail electricity to more than 63,800 customers in 110 communities in South Dakota. In 2019, by category, residential, commercial and other sales accounted for approximately 38%, 60%, and 2%, respectively, of our South Dakota retail electric utility revenue. During 2019, peak demand was 333 MWs with an average load of approximately 200 MWs.

Our South Dakota system is interconnected with the transmission facilities of Otter Tail Power Company; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.; Xcel Energy Inc.; and WAPA. We have emergency interconnections with the transmission facilities of East River Electric Cooperative, Inc. and West Central Electric Cooperative. 

Energy and Capacity Resources
We have a resource plan that includes estimates of customer usage and programs to provide for the economic, reliable and timely supply of energy. We continue to update our load forecast to identify the future electric energy needs of our customers, and we evaluate additional generating capacity requirements on an ongoing basis. We submitted a plan to the SDPUC in 2018 to provide for the modernization of our fleet, which is focused on improving reliability and flexibility. 
 12

We use market purchases and peaking generation to provide peak supply in excess of our base-load capacity. We are a member of the SPP. As a market participant in SPP, we buy and sell wholesale energy and reserves in both day-ahead and real-time markets through the operation of a single, consolidated SPP balancing authority. We and other SPP members submit into the SPP market both offers to sell our generation and bids to purchase power to serve our load. SPP optimizes next-day and real-time generation dispatch across the region and provides participants with greater access to economic energy. Marketing activities in SPP are handled for us by a third-party provider acting as our agent. 
Our sources of energy by type during 2019 were as follows:

Generation Facilities

Details of our generating facilities are described further in the following chart: 

Generation Facilities | Fuel Source | OwnershipInterest | Owned MW
Big Stone Plant, located near Big Stone City in northeastern South Dakota | Sub-bituminous coal | 23.4% | 111 
Coyote I Electric Generating Station, located near Beulah, North Dakota | Lignite coal | 10.0% | 43 
Neal Electric Generating Unit No. 4, located near Sioux City, Iowa | Sub-bituminous coal | 8.7% | 56 
Aberdeen Generating Units No. 1 and 2, located near Aberdeen, South Dakota | Natural gas | 100.0% | 73 
Beethoven Wind Project, located near Tripp, South Dakota | Wind | 100.0% | 80 
Miscellaneous combustion turbine units and small diesel units (used only during peak periods) | Combination of fuel oil and natural gas | 100.0% | 41 
Total Capacity | | | 404 

Our electric supply portfolio includes facilities that we own jointly with unaffiliated parties. Each of the jointly owned plants is subject to a joint management structure, and we are not the operator of any of these plants. Based on our ownership interest, we are entitled to a proportionate share of the capacity of our jointly owned plants and are responsible for a proportionate share of the operating costs. Additional resources in our supply portfolio include several wholly owned peaking units and one wholly owned wind project. The Beethoven wind project is an 80 MW nameplate facility. Actual output varies as 
 14

wind generation resources are highly dependent upon weather conditions. We also purchase the output of four wind projects, three of which are QFs, under power purchase agreements. 
The fuel for our jointly owned base-load generating plants is provided through supply contracts of various lengths with several coal companies. Coyote is a mine-mouth generating facility. Neal #4 and Big Stone receive their fuel supply via rail. The average delivered cost by type of fuel burned varies between generation facilities due to differences in transportation costs and owner purchasing power for coal supply. Changes in our fuel costs are passed on to customers through the operation of the fuel adjustment clause in our South Dakota tariffs.

We are a transmission-owning member in the SPP. Each year, we review all new or modified South Dakota transmission assets and transfer functional control of assets that qualify under the SPP Tariff to the SPP. To date, we have transferred control of 339 line miles of 115 kV facilities and over 97 line miles of 69 kV facilities. All of our SPP controlled facilities reside in the Upper Missouri Zone (UMZ), which is also known as Zone 19 in the regional transmission organization. The Coyote, Big Stone, and Neal power plants, which we jointly own, are connected directly to the MISO system. Our ownership rights in the transmission lines from these plants to our distribution system allow us to move the power to our customers. Along with operating the transmission system, SPP also coordinates regional transmission planning for all of its members.
 
NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS

Montana
Our regulated natural gas utility business in Montana includes production, storage, transmission and distribution. During 2019, we distributed natural gas to approximately 201,500 customers in 118 Montana communities over a system that consists of approximately 4,810 miles of underground distribution pipelines. We also serve several smaller distribution companies that provide service to approximately 37,000 customers. We transmit natural gas in Montana from production receipt points and storage facilities to distribution points and other nonaffiliated transmission systems. We transported natural gas volumes of approximately 45.8 Bcf during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Miles of Natural Gas Transmission | 2,165
Miles of Natural Gas Distribution | 4,810
City Gate Stations | 149 

 We have connections in Montana with four major, unaffiliated transmission systems: Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline, NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd., Colorado Interstate Gas, and Spur Energy. Twelve compressor sites provide more than 38,000 horsepower on the transmission line and an additional 15,000 horsepower at our storage fields, capable of moving more than 336,000 dekatherms per day. In addition, we own and operate two transmission pipelines through our subsidiaries, Canadian-Montana Pipe Line Corporation and Havre Pipeline Company, LLC. 

Natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, and as fuel for two electric generating facilities. The demand for natural gas largely depends upon weather conditions. Our Montana retail natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately 23.6 Bcf. Our Montana natural gas supply requirements for electric generation fuel for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately 4.1 Bcf. We have contracted with several major producers and marketers with varying contract durations to provide the anticipated supply to meet ongoing requirements. Our natural gas supply requirements are fulfilled through third-party fixed-term purchase contracts, short-term market purchases and owned production. Our portfolio approach to natural gas supply is intended to enable us to maintain a diversified supply of natural gas sufficient to meet our supply requirements. We benefit from direct access to suppliers in significant natural gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Rocky Mountains (Colorado), Montana, and Alberta, Canada.
Owned Production and Storage - Since 2010, we have acquired gas production and gathering system assets as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value: as we own these assets, which are regulated, our customers are protected from potential price spikes in the market. As of December 31, 2019, these owned reserves totaled approximately 47.2 Bcf and are estimated to provide approximately 3.8 Bcf in 2020, or about 16 percent of our expected annual retail natural gas load in Montana. In addition, we own and operate three working natural gas storage fields in Montana with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 17.85 Bcf and maximum aggregate daily deliverability of approximately 203,400 dekatherms. 
 15

South Dakota and Nebraska
We provide natural gas to approximately 90,100 customers in 59 South Dakota communities and three Nebraska communities. In South Dakota, we also transport natural gas for nine gas-marketing firms and three large end-user accounts. In Nebraska, we transport natural gas for four gas-marketing firms and one end-user account. We delivered approximately 27.6 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our South Dakota distribution system and approximately 3.6 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our Nebraska distribution system during 2019. 

Miles of Natural Gas Transmission | 55 
Miles of Natural Gas Distribution | 2,453

Our South Dakota natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately 6.9 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement to manage transportation and storage of supply to minimize cost and price volatility to our customers. In Nebraska, our natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately 4.9 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement that includes pipeline capacity, supply, and asset optimization activities. To supplement firm gas supplies in South Dakota and Nebraska, we contract for firm natural gas storage services to meet the heating season and peak day requirements of our customers. 
Municipal Natural Gas Franchise Agreements - We have municipal franchises to provide natural gas service in the communities we serve. The terms of the franchises vary by community. Our Montana franchises typically have a fixed 10-year term and continue for additional 10-year terms unless and until canceled, with 5 years notice. The maximum term permitted under Nebraska law for these franchises is 25 years while the maximum term permitted under South Dakota law is 20 years. Our policy generally is to seek renewal or extension of a franchise in the last year of its term. We continue to serve those customers while we obtain formal renewals. During the next five years, fifteen of our Montana franchises are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term, which account for approximately 75,000 or 37 percent of our Montana natural gas customers. Five of our South Dakota franchises and two franchises in Nebraska, which account for approximately 41,300 or 46% of our South Dakota and Nebraska natural gas customers, are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term during the next five years. We do not anticipate termination of any of these franchises.

REGULATION

Base rates are the rates that are intended to allow us the opportunity to collect from our customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to our cost of providing delivery and rate-based supply services, plus a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. We have both electric and natural gas base rates and cost recovery clauses. We may ask the respective regulatory commission to increase base rates from time to time. Rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs. For more information on current regulatory matters, see Note 3 - Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following is a summary of our rate base and authorized rates of return in each jurisdiction: 

Jurisdiction and Service | Implementation Date | Authorized Rate Base (millions) (1) | Estimated Rate Base (millions) (2) | Authorized Overall Rate of Return | Authorized Return on Equity | Authorized Equity Level
Montana electric delivery and production (3) | April 2019 | $2,030.1 | $2,407.3 | 6.92% | 9.65% | 49.38%

(1)    Rate base reflects amounts on which we are authorized to earn a return. 
(2)    Rate base amounts are estimated as of December 31, 2019. 
(3)    The revenue requirement associated with the FERC regulated portion of Montana electric transmission and DGGS are included as revenue credits to our MPSC jurisdictional customers. Therefore, we do not separately reflect FERC authorized rate base or authorized returns.
(4)    The Montana gas revenue requirement includes a stepdown which approximates annual depletion of our natural gas production assets included in rate base.
(5)    For those items marked as "n/a," the respective settlement and/or order was not specific as to these terms.
MPSC Regulation
Our Montana operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our operations, including when we issue, assume, or guarantee securities in Montana, or when we create liens on our regulated Montana properties. We have an obligation to provide service to our customers with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return. 
Electric Supply Tracker - In Montana, our electric supply costs recovery mechanism was revised effective July 1, 2017. The Power Cost and Credit Adjustment Mechanism (PCCAM) incorporates sharing of a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity. Customer prices may be adjusted annually to absorb a portion of the difference between base revenues and actual costs for the annual tracking period. Annual filings are based on a July through June 12-month tracking period, and are subject to a review by the MPSC to determine if electric supply procurement activities are prudent. If the MPSC subsequently determines that a procurement activity was imprudent, then it may disallow recovery of such costs. 
Natural Gas Supply Tracker - Rates for our Montana natural gas supply are set by the MPSC. Certain supply rates are adjusted on a monthly basis for volumes and costs during each July to June 12-month tracking period. Annually, supply rates are adjusted to include any differences in the previous tracking year's actual to estimated information for recovery during the subsequent tracking year. We submit annual natural gas tracker filings for the actual 12-month period ended June 30 and for the projected supply costs for the next 12-month period. The MPSC reviews such filings and makes its cost recovery determination based on whether or not our natural gas energy supply procurement activities were prudent. If the MPSC subsequently determines that a procurement activity was imprudent, then it may disallow such costs. 
 17

Montana Property Tax Tracker - We file an annual property tax tracker (including other state/local taxes and fees) with the MPSC for an automatic rate adjustment, which reflects the incremental property taxes since our last base rate filing adjusted for the associated income tax benefit.

SDPUC Regulation
Our South Dakota operations are subject to SDPUC jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our electric and natural gas operations. Our retail electric rates, approved by the SDPUC, provide several options for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including dual-fuel, interruptible, special all-electric heating, and other special rates. Our retail natural gas tariffs include gas transportation rates for transportation through our distribution systems by customers and natural gas marketers from the interstate pipelines at which our systems take delivery to the end-user. Such transporting customers nominate the amount of natural gas to be delivered daily. On a daily basis, we monitor usage for these customers and balance it against their respective supply agreements. 

An electric adjustment clause provides for quarterly adjustment based on differences in the delivered cost of energy, delivered cost of fuel, ad valorem taxes paid and commission-approved fuel incentives. The adjustment goes into effect upon filing, and is deemed approved within 10 days after the information filing unless the SDPUC staff requests changes during that period. A purchased gas adjustment provision in our natural gas rate schedules permits the monthly adjustment of charges to customers to reflect increases or decreases in purchased gas, gas transportation and ad valorem taxes. 

NPSC Regulation

Our Nebraska natural gas rates and terms and conditions of service for residential and smaller commercial customers are regulated by the NPSC. High volume customers are not subject to such regulation, but can file complaints if they allege discriminatory treatment. Under the Nebraska State Natural Gas Regulation Act, a regulated natural gas utility may propose a change in rates to its regulated customers, if it files an application for a rate increase with the NPSC and with the communities in which it serves customers. The utility may negotiate with those communities for a settlement with regard to the proposed rate change if the affected communities representing more than 50% of the affected ratepayers agree to direct negotiations, or it may proceed to have the NPSC review the filing and make a determination. Our tariffs have been approved by the NPSC, and the NPSC has adopted certain rules governing the terms and conditions of service of regulated natural gas utilities. Our retail natural gas tariffs provide residential, general service and commercial and industrial options, as well as firm and interruptible transportation service. A purchased gas adjustment clause provides for adjustments based on changes in gas supply and interstate pipeline transportation costs.

FERC Regulation

We are subject to FERC's jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates, hydro licensing and operations, the issuance of certain securities, incurrence of certain long-term debt, and compliance with mandatory reliability regulations, among other things. Under FERC's open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, as owners of transmission facilities, we are required to provide open access to our transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. In addition, we are required to comply with FERC's Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers. 

Our Montana wholesale transmission customers, such as cooperatives, industrial customers, and other customers that have third party commodity supply providers, are served under our OATT, which is on file with FERC. The OATT defines the terms, conditions and rates of our Montana transmission service, including ancillary services. Our South Dakota transmission operations are in the SPP and transmission service is provided under the SPP OATT. 

Our natural gas transportation pipelines are generally not subject to FERC's jurisdiction, although we are subject to state regulation. We conduct limited interstate transportation in Montana and South Dakota that is subject to FERC jurisdiction, and FERC has allowed the MPSC and SDPUC to set the rates for this interstate service. We have capacity agreements in South Dakota and Nebraska with interstate pipelines that are also subject to FERC jurisdiction.
Our hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC. In connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the FERC to issue a new license to the existing licensee or to a new licensee, and alternatively allows the U.S. government to take over the facility. If the existing licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net 
 18

investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable severance damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. 

Reliability Standards - We must comply with the standards and requirements that apply to the NERC functions for which we have registered in both the MRO for our South Dakota operations and the WECC for our Montana operations. WECC and the MRO have responsibility for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the FERC approved mandatory reliability standards within their respective regions. Additional reliability standards continue to be developed and will be adopted in the future. We expect that the existing reliability standards will change often as a result of modifications, guidance and clarification following industry implementation and ongoing audits and enforcement. 

ENVIRONMENTAL

The operation of electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities, and gas gathering, storage, transportation and distribution facilities, along with the development (involving site selection, environmental assessments, and permitting) and construction of these assets, are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and land use laws and regulations. Our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations that address emissions and impacts to the environment, including air and water, protection of natural resources and wildlife. We monitor federal, state, and local environmental initiatives to determine potential impacts on our financial results. As new laws or regulations are issued, we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or their operation to maintain ongoing compliance.
We strive to comply with all environmental regulations applicable to our operations. However, it is not possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or, what effect future laws or regulations may have on our operations. The EPA is in the process of proposing and finalizing a number of environmental regulations that will directly affect the electric industry over the coming years. These initiatives cover all sources - air, water and waste. For more information on environmental regulations and contingencies and related capital expenditures, see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
