Item 1.    Business
Unless otherwise specified, references to "Brookdale," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean Brookdale Senior Living Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Our Business
As of December 31, 2020, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 726 communities in 43 states and the ability to serve approximately 64,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a broad continuum of services across     the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry. We operate and manage independent living, assisted living, memory care, and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"). We also offer a range of home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services to more than 17,000 patients as of that date. 
Our community and service offerings combine housing with hospitality and healthcare services. Our senior living communities offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living ("ADLs") such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring/walking, and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. We also provide home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to age-in-place, which we believe enables them to maintain residency with us for a longer period of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives. 
Strategy
Our goal is to be the first choice in senior living by being the nation's most trusted and effective senior living provider and employer. We believe there are significant opportunities to create and deliver stockholder value as we execute on our strategy to achieve this goal. We continue to execute our core operational strategy that we initiated in early 2018, and we believe successful execution on that strategy provides the best opportunity for us to navigate and recover from the pandemic and to create stockholder value. We have supplemented our operational strategy with initiatives intended to complement and enhance our core operational efforts and to position us for future growth and success as we encounter changes and trends in demographics, customer preferences, technology, and healthcare delivery and outcomes. Our refined strategy is focused on these priorities: 
•Continued Operational Improvement and Efficiency. We are focused on our core senior living communities and intend to continue to drive operational improvements. Through our "win locally" initiative, we intend to provide choices for high quality care and personalized service by caring associates while leveraging our industry-leading scale and experience. Such efforts include optimizing our sales and marketing processes, prioritizing communities with the most opportunities for growth, and ensuring that our communities and their programming are competitive in the market. We also continue to focus on attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining the best associates by maintaining a compelling value proposition in the areas of leadership, career development, and meaningful work. We believe engaged associates lead to lower turnover, improved operations, and ultimately an enhanced resident experience that drives accelerated growth. To sharpen our focus on our core senior living operations, we are (and have been) executing on initiatives to reduce the complexity of our business and to ensure appropriate risk-reward tradeoffs in our highly regulated product lines. Such initiatives include exiting substantially all our entry fee CCRC business in 2020 (which also significantly reduced the number of skilled nursing facilities we operate) and continuing to optimize our management services business. 
•Senior Living Portfolio. Since initiating our operational turnaround strategy in early 2018, we have continued our portfolio optimization initiative through which we have disposed of owned and leased communities and restructured leases. Such transactions have included restructuring our leases with our three largest landlords, sales and conveyance of owned communities, and dispositions of substantially all of our remaining ownership interests in unconsolidated ventures, including our entry fee CCRC venture with Healthpeak Properties, Inc. ("Healthpeak"). As we move forward in 2021, we intend to continue to (i) expand our footprint and services in core markets where we have, or can achieve, a clear leadership position, (ii) execute an ongoing capital recycling program through acquiring leased or managed communities and exiting underperforming owned assets or leases when possible, and (iii) pivot back to portfolio growth through targeted development, investment, and acquisition opportunities. We will continue to invest in our development capital expenditures program through which we expand, renovate, reposition, and redevelop selected existing senior living communities where economically advantageous, although at a reduced pace during the pandemic. 
•Expansion of Healthcare and Service Platform. Our vision is to enable those we serve to live well by offering our residents the highest-quality healthcare and wellness platform in the senior living industry. We intend to further integrate our healthcare service model in certain markets in 2021. We also intend to pursue initiatives designed to accelerate growth in our healthcare services offered to residents within our communities and private duty services business. Such initiatives may include implementation of improvements to our sales and marketing efforts associated with our healthcare services, pursuit of additional or expanded relationships with managed care providers, and further development of healthcare relationships to capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe the successful execution of these initiatives and our healthcare strategy will drive incremental revenue by increasing move-ins, improving resident health and wellbeing, and as a result extend residents' average length of stay and increase occupancy. We also believe that we will improve the results of operations as we further develop as a partner of choice for healthcare service or payor organizations seeking to provide services within our communities and/or improve health outcomes at an overall lower cost of care. 
•Driving Innovation and Leveraging Technology. We are engaged in a variety of innovation initiatives and over time plan to pilot and test new ideas, technologies, and operating models in order to enhance our residents' engagement and experience, improve outcomes, and increase average length of stay and occupancy. With our technology platform, we also expect to identify solutions to reduce complexity, increase productivity, lower costs, and increase our ability to collaborate with third parties. 
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and likely will continue to adversely impact the senior living industry and our business. Due to the average age and prevalence of chronic medical conditions among our residents and patients, they generally are at disproportionately higher risk of hospitalization and adverse outcomes if they contract COVID-19. We continue to serve and care for seniors at our communities and their homes through the pandemic. A significant portion of our corporate support associates have worked from home since March 2020.
The health and wellbeing of our residents, patients, and associates is and has been our highest priority. We initiated our COVID-19 preparation efforts in January 2020. Our response efforts center on infection prevention and control protocols, including following requirements and guidance of federal, state, and local governments and agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") and U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"). We have enhanced and reinforced training our associates in such protocols and continue to actively monitor government requirements and guidance and adapt our policies, procedures, and response efforts when applicable. Upon confirmation of positive COVID-19 exposure at a community, we take actions intended to minimize further exposure, including associates' adhering to personal protection protocols, isolating residents or finding placement in an alternate care setting to best address their care needs, and in some cases, restricting new resident admissions, as directed by local health authorities.
Seeking to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into our communities, and to help control further exposure to infections within communities, in March 2020 we began restricting visitors at all our communities to essential healthcare personnel and certain compassionate care situations, screening associates and permitted visitors, suspending group outings, modifying communal dining and programming to comply with social distancing guidelines and, in most cases, implementing in-room only dining and activities programming, requesting that residents refrain from leaving the community unless medically necessary, and requiring new residents and residents returning from a hospital or nursing home to isolate in their apartment for fourteen days. These restrictions were in place across our portfolio for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We have adopted a framework for determining when to ease restrictions at each of our communities based on several criteria, including regulatory requirements and guidance, completion of baseline testing at the community, and the presence of current confirmed positive COVID-19 cases. Under this framework, we began easing restrictions on a community-by-community basis in July 2020 where regulatory requirements and guidance allowed, which easing may have included permitting outdoor, and in some cases, indoor visits with families, reduced capacity or socially distanced communal dining, limited communal activities programming, and in-person prospective resident visits. Although we are hopeful that administration of the vaccine to our residents and associates will enable us to further ease restrictions at our communities, those restrictions may continue for some time, and we may revert to more restrictive measures if the pandemic worsens, as necessary to comply with regulatory requirements, or at the direction of state or local health authorities.
In April 2020, we proactively commenced a resident and associate testing program for our communities. We undertook the program to identify positive, including asymptomatic, individuals, to better understand how our infection protocols are working, to help minimize the exposure to residents and associates of someone known to be COVID-19 positive, and in some cases to comply with state and local testing requirements. In July 2020, we completed baseline testing at all of our communities, 
and we have continued testing residents and associates at many of our communities. We also continue to utilize rapid point of care antigen test kits supplied by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") at those of our communities with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ("CLIA") waivers. Our testing program has accumulated approximately 320,000 test results. Approximately 1.2% of our residents were known to have current COVID-19 positive test results on February 22, 2021. Further testing, whether undertaken proactively, as a result of regulatory requirements, or at the direction of state or local health authorities, may result in significant additional expense, additional temporary restrictions on move-ins at affected communities, continued need for isolating positive residents, increased use of personal protective equipment ("PPE") by our associates, and increased employee-related costs. 
In December 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We elected to work with CVS Health Corporation, with whom we have a longstanding relationship to provide flu shot clinics in our communities, to administer vaccinations on site to our eligible residents and associates through the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program offered through the CDC. Our work to prepare for and host vaccine clinics includes extensive planning, gathering insurance information, obtaining consents, scheduling appointments, holding educational sessions with residents, families, and associates and detailed coordination of traffic flow and observation areas. We hosted our first clinics on December 18, 2020 and by January 22, 2021 had hosted over 500 community vaccine clinics. As of February 22, 2021, first dose vaccine clinics had been completed for residents and associates at 100% of our communities and approximately 85% of our communities have had second dose vaccine clinics.
The pandemic, including the related restrictions at our communities, have significantly disrupted demand for senior living communities and the sales process, which typically includes in-person prospective resident visits within communities. We believe potential residents and their families are more cautious regarding moving into senior living communities while the pandemic continues, and such caution may persist for some time. In response to these developments, we have redesigned our sales process to include virtual tours, video engagement, and outdoor prospective resident meetings, enhanced and adapted our marketing programs to address the social distancing environment, and sought to strengthen our relationships with referral sources. During the third quarter of 2020, we returned to using in-person prospective resident visits for a majority of our communities. However, several large markets continue with virtual-only prospective resident visits as of December 31, 2020. We have placed restrictions on move-ins at our communities when circumstances warrant, including at the direction of state or local health authorities. Although these restrictions began to ease considerably in August 2020, restrictions on move-ins escalated throughout the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the resurgence of the virus. At the end of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020, 86%, 98%, and 89% of our communities, respectively, were accepting new move-ins. As of February 22, 2021, 97% of our communities were accepting new move-ins. We cannot predict with reasonable certainty whether or when demand for senior living communities will return to pre-COVID-19 levels or the extent to which the pandemic’s effect on demand may adversely affect the amount of resident fees we are able to collect from our residents. 
The pandemic, including the related restrictions at our communities, began to adversely impact our occupancy and resident fee revenue significantly during March 2020, as new resident leads, visits (including virtual visits), and move-in activity declined significantly compared to typical levels. The year-over-year decrease in monthly move-ins of our same community portfolio has moderated from 64.2% in April 2020 to 26.5% in December 2020. Our consolidated senior housing portfolio's weighted average occupancy has declined in each month of the pandemic, from 82.7% in March 2020 to 71.5% in December 2020, and was 70.0% in January 2021. We estimate that the pandemic, including the related restrictions at our communities, resulted in $281.1 million of lost resident fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, including $228.5 million of lost resident fee revenue in our consolidated senior housing portfolio. Further deterioration of our resident fee revenue will result from lower move-in activity and the resident attrition inherent in our business, which may increase due to the impacts of COVID-19. Our home health average daily census also began to decrease in March 2020 due to lower occupancy in our communities and fewer elective medical procedures and hospital discharges, resulting in a 14.6% year-over-year decline in home health average daily census for the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect home health average daily census to continue to gradually recover sequentially with increased elective medical procedures and hospital discharges and senior housing occupancy. We estimate that the pandemic, including the related restrictions at our communities, resulted in $52.6 million of lost resident fee revenue for the Health Care Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Facility operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $125.5 million of incremental direct costs to prepare for and respond to the pandemic, including costs for: acquisition of additional PPE, medical equipment, and cleaning and disposable food service supplies; enhanced cleaning and environmental sanitation; increased employee-related costs, including labor, workers compensation, and health plan expense; increased expense for general liability claims; and COVID-19 testing of residents and associates where not otherwise covered by government payor or third-party insurance sources. We are not able to reasonably predict the total amount of costs we will incur related to the pandemic, and such costs may continue to be substantial. We also recorded non-cash impairment charges in our operating results of $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 for our operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower than expected operating performance at communities with impaired assets.
We have taken, and continue to take, actions to enhance and preserve our liquidity in response to the pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed our financing plans in the regular course of business, including refinancing substantially all of our 2020 and 2021 maturities. In addition, on August 31, 2020, we terminated our $250 million revolving credit facility and obtained $266.9 million of non-recourse mortgage financing on 16 communities, most of which had secured the credit facility prior to its termination. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we accepted $109.8 million of cash for grants under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund ("Provider Relief Fund") and $87.5 million of accelerated/advanced Medicare payments, and we deferred $72.7 million of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes. These programs were created or expanded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 ("CARES Act"), as described below. We also delayed or canceled a number of elective capital expenditure projects, resulting in an approximate $67 million reduction to our pre-pandemic full-year 2020 capital expenditure plans, and suspended repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. On July 26, 2020, we restructured our 120 community triple-net master lease with Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas") in a multipart transaction. The components included, among other things, reducing our initial annual minimum rent to $100 million, representing a reduction of approximately $86 million over the twelve months ending June 30, 2021, and removal of the prior requirements that we satisfy financial covenants and maintain a security deposit with Ventas. We paid a $119.2 million one-time cash lease payment to Ventas in connection with our lease restructuring transaction effective July 26, 2020. 
As of December 31, 2020, our total liquidity was $575.5 million, consisting of $380.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $172.9 million of marketable securities, and $22.2 million of availability on our secured credit facility. We continue to seek opportunities to enhance and preserve our liquidity, including through maintaining expense discipline, continuing to evaluate our financing structure and the state of debt markets, seeking further government-sponsored financial relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and completing the pending sale of 80% of the equity in our Health Care Services segment. There is no assurance that debt financing will continue to be available on terms consistent with our expectations or at all, that our efforts will be successful in seeking further government-sponsored financial relief or regarding the amount of, or conditions required to qualify for, any such relief, or that the closing of the pending transaction will be completed in accordance with our expectations, or at all, or generate cash proceeds to us in the amount we anticipate. 
The CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, and Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, signed into law on April 24, 2020, provide liquidity and financial relief to certain businesses, among other things. The impacts to us of certain provisions of the CARES Act are summarized below.
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we accepted $109.8 million of cash for grants from the Provider Relief Fund under which grants have been made available to eligible healthcare providers for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. The accepted grants were made available pursuant to the following distributions from the Provider Relief Fund:
•$101.7 million pursuant to General Distributions, with the aggregate amount ultimately determined based on a percentage of our year-over-year changes in patient care revenue and certain operating and other expenses for the first and second quarters of 2020. 
•$4.6 million pursuant to the Skilled Nursing Facility Targeted Distribution, which generally related to our certified skilled nursing facilities.
•$3.5 million pursuant to the Nursing Home Infection Control Distribution, including incentive payments, which related to our skilled nursing care provided through our CCRCs.
Grants received from the Provider Relief Fund are subject to the terms and conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 and will reimburse only for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19 and have not been reimbursed from other sources or that other sources are not obligated to reimburse. The permissible uses of grants from the Nursing Home Infection Control Distribution are further limited to certain infection control expenses. The program requires us to report to HHS on our use of the grants, and our reporting is subject to audit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $109.8 million of the grants as other operating income based upon our estimates of our satisfaction of the conditions of the grants during such period.
HHS continues to evaluate future allocations of, and regulation and guidance regarding, grants made under the Provider Relief Fund. We intend to pursue additional funding that may become available. However, there can be no assurance that we will qualify for, or receive, grants in the amount we expect, that additional restrictions on the permissible uses or terms and conditions of the grants will not be imposed by HHS, or that future funding programs will be made available for which we qualify.
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $87.5 million under the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program administered by CMS, which was temporarily expanded by the CARES Act. Approximately $75.2 million related to our Health Care Services segment and the remainder related to our CCRCs segment. Under the program, we requested acceleration/advancement of 100% of our Medicare payment amount for a three-month period. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act, enacted on October 1, 2020, amended the repayment terms for accelerated/advanced payments. As amended, recoupment of accelerated/advanced payments will begin one year after payments were issued. Payments will be recouped at a rate of 25% of Medicare payments for the first eleven months following the anniversary of issuance and at a rate of 50% of Medicare payments for the next six months. Any outstanding balance of accelerated/advanced payments will be due following such recoupment period. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) we expect to repay the then outstanding balance of such accelerated/advance payments related to our Health Care Services segment at the closing of the sale of 80% of our equity in our Health Care Services segment.
•Under the CARES Act, we have elected to defer payment of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. One-half of such deferral amount will become due on each of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred payment of $72.7 million under the program.
•The CARES Act temporarily suspended the 2% Medicare sequestration for the period May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, which primarily benefited our Health Care Services segment. This suspension had a favorable impact of $4.0 million on the segment’s resident fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the sequestration suspension through March 31, 2021. 
•We are eligible to claim the employee retention tax credit for certain of our associates under the CARES Act. The refundable tax credit for 2020 is available to employers that fully or partially suspend operations during any calendar quarter in 2020 due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19, and is equal to 50% of qualified wages paid after March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2020 to qualified employees, with a maximum credit of $5,000 per employee. We estimate that we will be eligible to claim tax credits of approximately $10 million for 2020. The credit was modified and extended for wages paid from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and we are assessing our eligibility to claim such credit. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for, or receive, tax credits in the amount we expect.
In addition to the grants described above, we have received and recognized $5.9 million of other operating income from grants from other government sources.
We cannot predict with reasonable certainty the impacts that COVID-19 ultimately will have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity, and our response efforts may continue to delay or negatively impact our strategic initiatives, including plans for future growth. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 will depend on many factors, some of which cannot be foreseen, including the duration, severity, and breadth of the pandemic and any resurgence of the disease; the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s economy and debt and equity markets and the local economies in our markets; the development, availability, utilization, and efficacy of COVID-19 testing, therapeutic agents, and vaccines and the prioritization of such resources among businesses and demographic groups; government financial and regulatory relief efforts that may become available to business and individuals, including our ability to qualify for and satisfy the terms and conditions of financial relief; perceptions regarding the safety of senior living communities during and after the pandemic; changes in demand for senior living communities and our ability to adapt our sales and marketing efforts to meet that demand; the impact of COVID-19 on our residents’ and their families’ ability to afford our resident fees, including due to changes in unemployment rates, consumer confidence, housing markets, and equity markets caused by COVID-19; changes in the acuity levels of our new residents; the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on seniors generally and those residing in our communities; the duration and costs of our response efforts, including increased equipment, supplies, labor, litigation, testing, vaccination clinic, and other expenses; the impact of COVID-19 on our ability to complete financings, refinancings, or other transactions (including dispositions) or to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and lease payments and to satisfy financial and other covenants in our debt and lease documents; increased regulatory requirements, including unfunded, mandatory testing; increased enforcement actions resulting from COVID-19; government action that may limit our collection or discharge efforts for delinquent accounts; and the frequency and magnitude of legal actions and liability claims that may arise due to COVID-19 or our response efforts. 
2021 Pending Sale of Health Care Services
On February 24, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with affiliates of HCA Healthcare, Inc. (“HCA Healthcare”), providing for the sale of 80% of our equity in our Health Care Services segment for a 
purchase price of $400 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including a reduction for the remaining outstanding balance as of the closing of Medicare advance payments and deferred payroll tax payments related to the Health Care Services segment, which were $75.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. We expect our net cash proceeds at the closing will be approximately $300 million, subject to the timing of closing with respect to the adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also contains certain agreed upon indemnities for the benefit of the purchaser. The closing of the sale transaction is anticipated to occur in the late first half or early second half of 2021, subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, at closing of the transaction, we will retain a 20% equity interest in the business. Upon closing, we expect that the results and financial position of our Health Care Services segment will be deconsolidated from our financial statements and that our interest in the joint venture will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We anticipate that the sale transaction will utilize a portion of our federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset the expected taxable gain on such transaction. 
Community Portfolio Optimization
During 2020, we continued execution on our portfolio optimization initiative through which we have disposed of owned and leased communities and restructured leases. Such activities during 2020 included restructuring our lease arrangements with Ventas announced on July 27, 2020 and closing the multi-part transaction with Healthpeak announced on October 1, 2019. As a result of these initiatives and other lease restructuring, expiration, and termination activity, and other transactions, during the year ended December 31, 2020 we: 
•Terminated our triple-net lease obligations on an aggregate of 32 communities, including through the acquisition of 27 formerly leased communities;
•Disposed of an aggregate of seven owned communities; 
•Sold substantially all of our remaining ownership interests in unconsolidated ventures, including our entry fee CCRC venture with Healthpeak; and
•Reduced our management of communities on behalf of former unconsolidated ventures and third parties, representing a net reduction of 25 managed communities during the year. 
Summaries of these transactions, and their impact on our results of operations are set forth in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." See also Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information about the transactions.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 350 communities, representing a majority of our consolidated community portfolio, leased 301 communities, and managed 75 communities. The charts below show the foregoing changes in our portfolio from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
During the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect to close on the dispositions of three owned communities (249 units) classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and terminations of a substantial portion of our management arrangements. The closings of the various pending and expected transactions are, or will be, subject to the satisfaction of various closing 
conditions, including (where applicable) the receipt of regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that the transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur. 
Capital Expenditures
Our total community-level capital expenditures were $140.1 million for 2020, which was a decrease of $98.6 million from 2019, and $27.8 million of which was reimbursed by our lessors. The decrease in community-level capital expenditures was partially due to our approximate $48 million reduction to our pre-pandemic full-year 2020 community-level capital expenditure plans as we delayed or canceled a number of elective capital expenditure projects in response to the pandemic. In the aggregate, we expect our full-year 2021 non-development capital expenditures, net of anticipated lessor reimbursements, to be approximately $140 million. In addition, we expect our full-year 2021 development capital expenditures to be approximately $10 million, net of anticipated lessor reimbursements, and such projects include those for expansion, repositioning, redeveloping, and major renovation of selected existing senior living communities. We anticipate that our 2021 capital expenditures will be funded from cash on hand, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and reimbursements from lessors. 
The Senior Living Industry
The senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth in the last 25 years, marked by the emergence of assisted living communities in the mid-1990s, and it remains highly fragmented with numerous local and regional operators. According to data from the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry ("NIC"), there were approximately 2,500 local and regional senior housing operators as of December 31, 2020, of which more than 90% operated five or fewer communities. We are one of a limited number of large operators that provide a broad range of community locations and service level offerings at varying price levels.
The industry has attracted additional investment resulting in increased construction and development of new senior housing supply. New community openings have subjected the senior housing industry to oversupply and increased competitive pressures. Data from NIC shows that industry occupancy began to decrease starting in 2016 as a result of new openings and oversupply. During and since 2016, we have experienced an elevated rate of competitive new openings, with significant new competition opening in many markets, which has adversely affected our occupancy, revenues, results of operations, and cash flow. In 2020, competitive new openings remained elevated, but declined from 2019. Beginning in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in additional occupancy pressure for our industry. NIC data shows that seniors housing occupancy decreased for three consecutive quarters between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with nearly all markets falling to record low occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2020. We cannot predict with reasonable certainty whether or when demand for senior living communities will return to pre-COVID-19 levels or the extent to which the pandemic’s effect on demand may adversely affect the amount of resident fees we are able to collect from our residents. 
The primary market of the senior living industry is individuals age 80 and older. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition, and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow. US Census projections suggest that, starting in 2022, there will be nearly one million new potential residents per year, and we believe that demand for senior care will increase as a result. 
As seniors are living longer and this segment of the population rapidly grows, so will the number living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and the burden of chronic diseases and conditions. As a result of increased mobility in society, a reduction of average family size, and increased number of two-wage earner couples, families struggle to provide care for seniors and therefore look for alternatives outside of their family for care. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services. 
In recent years, the high level of new openings, nursing and caregiver shortages due to the pandemic, lower levels of unemployment, and implementation of higher minimum wages generally have contributed to wage pressures and increased competition for community leadership and personnel. We continue to address new competition by focusing on operations with the objective to ensure high customer satisfaction, retain key leadership, and actively engage district and regional management in community operations; enhancing our local and national marketing and public relations efforts; and evaluating current community position relative to competition and repositioning if necessary (e.g., services, amenities, programming, and price). Like other companies, our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing salaries, wages, and benefits costs for our associates, particularly if such costs cannot be covered by implementing price increases. Higher costs of food, utilities, equipment and supplies, insurance, and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to our industry, as outlined above. Additional challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing sectors, which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials. In addition, there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress will take on reimbursement policies of the Medicare or Medicaid programs or what future rule changes CMS will implement. Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of government reimbursement programs could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and cash flow. 
Competition
The senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous organizations, including not-for-profit entities, that offer similar communities and services, such as home health care and hospice agencies, community-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers, and other senior living providers. In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living, assisted living, and memory care sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial. Consequently, we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract and retain residents and associates, raise or maintain resident fees, and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy, revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. Due to the industry's low occupancy levels, certain competitors may price aggressively in order to capture market share. Our major publicly-traded senior housing competitors are Capital Senior Living Corporation and Five Star Senior Living, Inc. Our major private senior housing competitors include Holiday Retirement, Life Care Services, LLC, Atria Senior Living Inc., Senior Lifestyle Corp., and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, as well as a large number of not-for-profit entities. 
Over the long term we plan to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, pursue development, investment, and acquisition opportunities. The market for acquiring and/or operating senior living communities is highly competitive, and some of our present and potential senior living competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital. In addition, several publicly-traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and private equity firms have similar objectives as we do, along with greater financial resources and/or lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain. Partially as a result of tax law changes enacted through REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act ("RIDEA"), we now compete more directly with the various publicly-traded healthcare REITs for the acquisition of senior housing properties, the largest of which are Ventas and Welltower. 
Our History
Brookdale Senior Living Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in June 2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, which had been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. On November 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, and on July 25, 2006, we acquired American Retirement Corporation, another leading senior living provider that had been operating independently since 1978. On September 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Horizon Bay, which was the then-ninth largest operator of senior living communities in the United States. On July 31, 2014, we completed our acquisition by merger of Emeritus Corporation, which was the then-second largest operator of senior living communities in the United States. 
Segments
As of December 31, 2020, we had five reportable segments: Independent Living; Assisted Living and Memory Care; CCRCs; Health Care Services; and Management Services. These segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision maker organizes our business activities for making operating decisions, assessing performance, developing strategy, and allocating capital resources. 
Communities that we own or lease are included in the Independent Living, Assisted Living and Memory Care, or CCRCs segment, as applicable. The home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services provided to our residents and seniors living outside of our communities are generally included in the Health Care Services segment, while skilled nursing and inpatient healthcare services provided in our skilled nursing units are included in the CCRCs segment. Communities that we manage on behalf of third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in the Management Services segment. The table below shows the number of communities and units within each of our senior housing and Management Services segments as of December 31, 2020. 

 | Communities | Units | | % of Total Units | Average Number of Units per Community
Independent Living | 68 | | 12,534 | | 19.9 | % | 184
Assisted Living and Memory Care | 563 | | 35,126 | | 55.7 | % | 62 
CCRCs | 20 | | 5,322 | | 8.4 | % | 266
Management Services | 75 | | 10,129 | | 16.0 | % | 135
Total | 726 | | 63,111 | | 100.0 | % | 87 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 81.9% of our resident fee revenue from private pay customers, 14.5% from government reimbursement programs (primarily Medicare) and 3.6% from other payor sources. Approximately 87.3% of resident fee revenue was derived from our senior housing segments, of which 50.9% of our resident fee revenue was generated from owned communities and 36.4% was generated from leased communities. Our Health Care Services segment generated 12.7% of resident fee revenue. The table below shows the percentage of our resident fee and management fee revenue attributable to each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

(in thousands) | Resident Fee and Management Fee Revenue | | % of Total
Independent Living | $ | 512,598 | | | 17.0 | %
Assisted Living and Memory Care | 1,691,276 | | | 55.9 | % 
CCRCs | 321,883 | | | 10.6 | % 
Health Care Services | 366,810 | | | 12.1 | % 
Management Services | 130,690 | | | 4.4 | % 
Total resident fee and management fee revenue | $ | 3,023,257 | | | 100.0 | %

Further operating results and financial metrics from our five segments are discussed further in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Our Community Offerings
We offer a variety of senior living communities in locations across the United States. We operate and manage independent living, assisted living, and memory care communities, and CCRCs. The majority of our units are organized in campus-like settings or stand-alone communities offering multiple service levels.
Independent Living Communities
Our independent living communities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors who desire to live in a residential setting that feels like home, without the efforts of ownership. Some of our independent living residents choose to relocate to a community in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children. The majority of our independent living communities consist of both independent and assisted living units in a single community, which allows residents to age-in-place by providing them with a broad continuum of senior independent and assisted living services to accommodate their changing needs. While the number varies depending upon the particular community, as of December 31, 2020 approximately 80% of all of the units at our independent living communities were independent living units, with the balance of the units licensed for assisted living and memory care.
Our independent living communities are generally large multi-story buildings averaging 184 units with extensive common areas and amenities to support the lifestyle preferences of more independent seniors. Residents may choose from studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units, depending upon the specific community. Each independent living community provides residents with basic services such as dining service options, 24-hour emergency response, housekeeping, education and wellness programs, and recreational activities. Most of these communities also offer custom tailored concierge and personal assistance/private duty services at an additional charge, which may include medication reminders, daily check-in, transportation, shopping, escort, and companion services. 
In addition to the basic services, our independent living communities that include assisted living also provide residents with personal care and convenience service options to provide assistance with ADLs. The levels of care provided to residents vary from community to community depending, among other things, upon the licensing requirements and healthcare regulations of the state in which the community is located.
Residents in our independent living communities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available (not including skilled nursing). Residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs can often be accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or, in certain communities, are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor. These communities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas. 
Assisted Living and Memory Care Communities
Our assisted living and memory care communities offer housing and 24-hour assistance with ADLs for mid-acuity and frail elderly residents. Residents typically enter an assisted living or memory care community due to a relatively immediate need for services that may have been triggered by a medical event. Our assisted living and memory care communities include both freestanding, multi-story communities with more than 50 beds, as well as smaller, freestanding, single story communities. Although building layouts will vary depending on specific location, the community may include (i) private studio, one-bedroom, and one-bedroom deluxe apartments, or (ii) individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or "neighborhoods" scaled to a single-family home, that would include a living room, dining room, patio or enclosed porch, laundry room, and personal care area, as well as a caregiver work station.
We also provide memory care services at freestanding memory care communities that are specifically designed for residents with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other forms of cognitive impairment. Our freestanding memory care communities have approximately 20 to 70 beds and some are part of a campus-like setting which includes a freestanding assisted living community. As of December 31, 2020, we provide memory care services at 371 of our communities, aggregating 9,796 memory care units across our segments. These communities include 110 freestanding memory care communities with 4,279 units included in our Assisted Living and Memory Care segment. 
All residents at our assisted living and memory care communities are eligible to receive the basic care level, which includes ongoing health assessments, three meals per day and snacks, coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian, 24-hour staff assistance, assistance with medical care coordination, education and wellness programs, social and recreational activities providing socialization and engagement, housekeeping, and personal laundry services. In some locations, we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address needs associated with early stages of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. For an additional cost at these communities, we offer higher levels of personal care services to residents who are more physically frail or require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments.
As a result of their progressive cognitive decline, residents at our memory care units typically require higher levels of personal care and services than in assisted living and therefore pay higher monthly service fees. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management, and an activities program, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents' decreased functional abilities. 
CCRCs
Our CCRCs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate a broad spectrum of physical ability and healthcare needs. Most of our CCRCs have independent living, assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing available on one campus or within the immediate area. Our CCRC residents are generally seniors who are seeking a community that offers a broad continuum of care that will enable them to age in place. Generally, these residents will initially enter the community as an independent living resident and may, at a later time, advance into an assisted living or skilled nursing area as their needs change. 
Our Healthcare Services Offerings 
Through our Health Care Services segment we currently provide home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. As of December 31, 2020, our Health Care Services segment platform included networks in 28 states with the ability to provide home health services to approximately 60% of our units, hospice services to approximately 25% of our units, and outpatient therapy to approximately 20% of our units. The Health Care Services segment does not include the skilled nursing and inpatient healthcare services 
provided in our skilled nursing units, which are included in our CCRCs segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated approximately 45% of our Health Care Services segment revenue from residents at our communities and approximately 55% from our patients outside our communities. As described above, we expect to sell 80% of our equity in our Health Care Services segment pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with HCA Healthcare, which transaction is expected to occur in the late first half or early second half of 2021. Upon closing, we expect that the results and financial position of our Health Care Services segment will be deconsolidated from our financial statements.
The home health services we provide include skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, home health aide services, and social services as needed. Our hospice services include clinical and skilled care, as well as spiritual and emotional counseling. Our outpatient therapy services include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology services, and other specialized therapy. The majority of our home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services are reimbursed by government reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare, and non-covered services are paid directly by patients from private pay sources. 
Management Services
As of December 31, 2020, we managed 72 communities (9,202 units) on behalf of third parties and three communities (927 units) for which we have an equity interest, which represented approximately 16% of our senior housing capacity. Under our management arrangements, we receive management fees, which are generally determined by an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues (as defined in the management arrangement), as well as reimbursed expenses, which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners. During 2021, we expect terminations of a substantial portion of our management arrangements. Generally either party to our management arrangements may terminate upon the occurrence of an event of default caused by the other party, generally subject to cure rights. Several long-term agreements also provide for early termination rights of the owner which may in some cases require an early termination fee. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe our national network of senior living communities and healthcare services networks are well positioned to benefit from the future growth in the industry. Some of our most significant competitive strengths are: 
•Skilled management team with extensive experience. Our senior management team and our Board of Directors have extensive experience in the senior living, healthcare, hospitality, and real estate industries, including the operation and management of a broad range of senior living assets. 
•Geographically diverse, high-quality, purpose-built communities. As of December 31, 2020, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 726 communities in 43 states and the ability to serve approximately 64,000 residents. 
•Ability to provide a broad spectrum of care. Given our diverse mix of independent living, assisted living and memory care communities, and CCRCs, as well as our healthcare services offerings, through our clinical team and high-quality relationships with providers, we are able to meet a wide range of our residents' and patients' needs. We believe that we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability and the only company that does so at scale on a national basis. We believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross-selling opportunities. 
•Significant experience in providing healthcare services. Through our Health Care Services segment, we currently provide, and following the closing of our transaction with HCA Healthcare, the venture will provide a range of home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy services in certain of our communities. Additionally, through our clinical team, we provide education, wellness, and other services to residents, which we believe is a distinct competitive difference among senior housing operators. We have significant experience in providing these services and expect to expand our offerings of these services to additional residents.
•The size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies while continuing a local-community focus. The size of our business allows us to realize cost savings, economies of scale in the procurement of goods and services, and access to favorable debt and financing terms. Our scale also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions. We negotiate contracts for food, insurance, and other goods and services with the advantages that scale provides. In addition, we leverage our centralized corporate functions such as finance, human resources, legal, information technology, and marketing. We intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform and to enhance our residents' and patients' experiences. We believe that our geographic 
footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. 
Seasonality
Our senior housing business has typically experienced some seasonality, which we experience in certain regions more than others, due to weather patterns, geography, and higher incidence and severity of flu and other illnesses during winter months. Although our seasonal pattern varies from year to year and occupancy patterns have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, historically our average monthly occupancy has generally begun to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter of the year, and we have generally expected average monthly occupancy to begin to increase towards the end of the second quarter each year. Utility expenses trend seasonally high in the first quarter and third quarter of each year. Facility operating expenses, such as labor, food, and supplies also trend higher in the second half of the year compared with the first half due to an increased number of working days. 
Operations
Operations Overview
We have implemented intensive standards, policies and procedures, and systems, including detailed staff resources and training, which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service. Further, we believe our centralized support infrastructure allows our community-based leaders and personnel to focus on resident care and family connections. 
Consolidated Corporate Operations Support
We have developed a centralized support infrastructure and services platform, which we believe provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. The size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as procurement, human resources, finance, accounting, legal, information technology, and marketing. We are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food, supplies, insurance, benefits, and other goods and services. In addition, we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and communities in areas such as training, regulatory affairs, asset management, dining, clinical services, sales, customer engagement, marketing, and procurement. We have also established company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things: resident care; community design and community operations; billing and collections; accounts payable; finance and accounting; risk management; development of associate training materials and programs; advertising and marketing activities; the hiring and training of management and other community-based personnel; compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements; and implementation of our acquisition, development, and leasing plans. 
Community Staffing and Training
Each community has an Executive Director responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the community, including quality of care and service, social services, and financial performance. Each Executive Director receives specialized training from our learning and development associates. In addition, a portion of each Executive Director's compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the community. We continue to take actions intended to simplify the role of our Executive Directors to allow them to focus on our residents and their families and our associates. We believe that the quality of our communities, coupled with support provided by the regional support infrastructure and our ability to provide industry-leading systems and training, has enabled us to attract high-quality, professional community Executive Directors. 
Depending upon the size and type of the community, each Executive Director is supported by key leaders, a Health and Wellness Director (or nursing director), and/or a Sales Director. The Health and Wellness Director or nursing director is directly responsible for day-to-day care of residents. The Sales Director oversees the community's sales, marketing, and community outreach programs. Other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services, activities, housekeeping, and maintenance. 
We believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact. Associates involved in resident care, including administrative staff, are trained in support and care protocols, including emergency response techniques. We have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents. We have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold regular training sessions for management and staff at each community. 
Quality Assurance
We maintain quality assurance programs at each of our communities through our corporate and regional staff. Our quality assurance programs are designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction through the care and services that we provide and we have continued to transform our efforts throughout the pandemic through collaboration with our vendors and a combination of remote and in-person visits. Our quality control measures include, among other things, community inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis. These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds; the appearance and cleanliness of the interior; the professionalism and friendliness of staff; quality of resident care (including assisted living services, nursing care, therapy, and home health programs); the quality of activities and the dining program; observance of residents in their daily living activities; and compliance with government regulations. Our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services we provide to residents. 
In order to foster a sense of belonging and engagement, as well as to respond to residents' needs and desires, at many of our communities, we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committees that meet at least monthly with the Executive Director of the community. Separate resident committees also exist at many of these communities for food service, activities, marketing, and hospitality. These committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable community management to be more responsive to their residents' needs and desires. 
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing efforts are intended to create awareness of our brand and services to educate prospects and referral sources about the Brookdale difference. We meet prospects where they are in their journey, whether they are learning about senior living for the first time or need to schedule a visit at one of our communities. We target a variety of audiences who have a role in the decision-making process for senior housing and our healthcare services, including potential residents, their family members and referral sources, including the medical community (hospital discharge planners, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and social workers), professional organizations, employer groups, clergy, area agencies for the elderly, and paid referral organizations. Our marketing associates develop strategies to promote our communities at the local market and national level. We execute an integrated marketing campaign approach, including local media and outreach programs, digital advertising, social media, print advertising, e-mail, direct mail, and special events, such as health fairs and community receptions. We generate hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries that go directly to our communities and Brookdale website. All online forms and many calls are handled by trained senior living advisors in our Brookdale Connection Center, who schedule visits directly to our communities. Certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted at many communities within the limitations of federal and state laws. 
We will continue to leverage and grow our Brookdale brand to win locally in the markets we serve. In many markets where we offer more choices for senior living based on budget, lifestyle, and care needs, we use a network selling methodology to educate prospects on all of the options available. With our selling model, sales associates are organized to support individual and multiple communities directly. To meet the needs of local demand and supply, we create differentiated value through the segmentation of our communities based on price, service offerings, amenities, and programs offered. 
Human Capital Resources
At Brookdale, we are dedicated to enriching the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence, and integrity. We know that our success is dependent on attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining the best associates. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 45,000 associates, 70% of which were full time. Approximately 900 associates work in or through our Brentwood, Tennessee headquarters and Milwaukee, Wisconsin office, supporting our community- and agency-based associates.
Our Culture
We promote a culture based on servant leadership, where we believe purpose-driven work allows each of us to have a positive impact on the residents, patients, and associates we interact with every day. Our 2020 associate engagement survey showed that 93% of respondents know how they contribute to our success and 95% have a good understanding of our mission, vision, and cornerstones of passion, courage, partnership, and trust. We hire associates who we believe make serving seniors their calling, do what is right even when no one is watching, connect with fellow associates and our residents and patients, and treat one another with respect. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We are a business of people taking care of people, where our associates do extraordinary things every day as part of their shared commitment to Brookdale’s cornerstones and mission. To attract and retain associates, we are committed to maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment where people have an equal chance to grow and succeed. We support our associates by providing an open door policy, offering training to help our people grow and to understand our commitment to providing a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, consistently enforcing our policies, and maintaining the expectation that all our associates will be treated with dignity and respect.
We also believe that true commitment to creating and fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace is best accomplished by example. Our Board of Directors has purposefully evolved its gender composition to more closely resemble our customer and employee base, of which the majority are women. Women now comprise 44% of our Board of Directors. Over the last two years, we also increased the diversity of our Board of Directors and executive leadership team. Two of the top three positions are held by women and 14% of our executive officers are racially or ethnically diverse. Our commitment to diversity is further reflected in our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 81% of our associates are women, who comprise approximately 73% of the leadership roles at our communities, agencies, and corporate offices, and approximately 53% of our associates and 12% of our leadership roles are people of color. Our commitment to developing, retaining, and promoting diverse talent and advancing our inclusion strategy is ongoing.
Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention:
In order to attract people who want to do challenging yet rewarding work, we offer competitive wages and benefits as well as opportunities to grow a career at Brookdale through mentorship, education, and training opportunities. We use a variety of recruitment strategies to attract diverse talent to our organization, including partnerships with local and national organizations. In 2020, we established new nursing school partnerships in Jacksonville, Florida and Denver, Colorado to continue to strengthen our pipeline for caregiver and clinical roles. Additionally, we launched a new career section on our website to attract veterans and military spouses/partners to join Brookdale.
We offer learning opportunities for our associates when they join Brookdale and throughout the year. Our newly implemented iLearn platform provides associates access to regulatory training, continuing education courses, and leadership and professional skill courses. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program for associates to continue to grow their career. To identify future leaders, we conduct strategic talent reviews regularly to provide senior leaders with visibility into succession for key leadership roles. 
We believe the performance of individual communities is correlated to retention of our community leaders. Our Executive Director (ED) and Health and Wellness Director (HWD) combined annual retention at our same community portfolio has remained around 70%. 
Total Rewards
We consider offering a competitive total rewards program an important aspect of being an employer of choice. Both full-time and part-time associates may participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan with an opportunity for a matching contribution, our associate stock purchase plan, and other benefit plans. We provide full-time associates additional benefits, including paid time off ("PTO") and holidays as well as adoption benefits. In 2020, over 50% of eligible full-time associates participated in our medical and dental insurance plans.
We also recognize that there may be a time when associates need financial assistance due to extraordinary circumstances such as a fire, a tornado or hurricane, or the pandemic. Our Associate Compassion Fund provides this type of assistance for associates in need. In 2020, approximately $1.8 million of donations of PTO by our associates were provided directly to associates in need, approximately $0.3 million of which was donated by our senior leadership team to specifically support those associates affected by COVID-19.
Industry Regulation
The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it. Federal, state, and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-community providers like us. Some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include: state and local laws impacting licensure, protecting consumers against deceptive practices, and generally affecting the communities' management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations, such as fire, health, safety, and privacy laws and regulations; federal and state laws governing Medicare and Medicaid, which regulate allowable costs, pricing, quality of services, quality of care, food service, resident rights (including abuse and neglect) and fraud; federal and state residents' rights statutes and regulations; Anti-Kickback and physicians referral ("Stark") laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state, and local legislation or regulation. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Many senior living communities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Although requirements vary from state to state, these requirements may address, among others, the following: personnel education, training, and records; community services; staffing; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; emergency power generator requirements; professional licensing and certification of staff; and resident rights and responsibilities. In several of the states in which we operate there are different levels of care that may be provided based on the level of licensure. Several of the states in which we operate, or intend to operate, assisted living and memory care communities, home health and hospice agencies, and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community or agency may be opened or the services at an existing community may be expanded. Senior living communities may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire, and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted. These laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets. 
Unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a regulator's receipt of a complaint about a provider. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive survey reports from state or federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the community's operations, but the reviewing agency may have the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community or agency, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal and/or state reimbursement programs, or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension, or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers' or facilities' history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine, or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, or cash flows. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole. In addition, states' Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living and memory care communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds. 
Regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry, particularly assisted living and memory care. Our operations could suffer from future regulatory developments, such as federal assisted living and memory care laws and regulations, as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials or an increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties. Certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state. Revocation or suspension of a license, or a citation, at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities, which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross-defaults or may also trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements, or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one community's citation will impact another of our communities, this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups, in addition to federal and state regulators, our operations could be adversely affected. Any adverse 
finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community or individual. 
There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, relationships, and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers, including those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud. With respect to our participation in federal healthcare reimbursement programs, the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the False Claims Act alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties. The False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery. Because of these incentives, so-called "whistleblower" suits have become more frequent. 
Additionally, since we operate communities and agencies that participate in federal and/or state healthcare reimbursement programs, we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are false, fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state laws vary from state to state. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure, citations, sanctions, and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, which may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults. 
We are subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by healthcare providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws, and certain state referral laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or to solicit or receive) "any remuneration ... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind" for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between healthcare providers and sources of patient referral. If we were to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, we may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs, which may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our business, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations. 
We are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules pursuant to HIPAA relating to the privacy of such information. Rules that became effective in 2003 govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain HIPAA covered communities. We established procedures to comply with HIPAA privacy requirements at these communities. We were required to be in compliance with the HIPAA rule establishing administrative, physical, and technical security standards for health information by 2005. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with these rules. In addition, states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data protection or transparency. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in 2020, and we expect additional federal and state legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate consumer privacy protection in the future. These legislative and regulatory developments will impact the design and operation of our business and our privacy and security efforts.
We are subject to federal and state laws, regulations and executive orders relating to healthcare providers’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These requirements vary based on provider type and jurisdiction but generally include mandatory requirements for testing of residents and/or staff, implementation of infection control standards and procedures, imposition of restrictions on new admissions or readmissions of residents, requiring screening of all persons entering a community, imposition of restrictions or limitations on who and how residents may be visited, and imposition of mandatory notification requirements to residents, families, staff, and regulatory bodies related to positive COVID-19 cases. Enhanced or additional penalties may apply for violation of such requirements.
Medicare and Medicaid Programs
We rely on reimbursement from government programs, including the Medicare program and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid programs, for a portion of our revenues. Reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid represented 11.3% and 3.2%, respectively, of our total resident fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the period, Medicare reimbursements represented 76.8% of our Health Care Services segment revenue, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements represented 18.5% of our CCRCs segment revenue. 
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and certain disabled persons. We receive revenue for our home health, hospice, skilled nursing, and outpatient therapy services from Medicare. Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state, funded with federal and state funds pursuant to which healthcare benefits are available to certain indigent or disabled patients. We receive reimbursements under Medicaid (including state Medicaid waiver programs) for many of our assisted living and memory care communities. 
These government reimbursement programs are highly regulated, involve significant administrative discretion, and are subject to frequent and substantial legislative, administrative, and interpretive changes, which may significantly affect reimbursement rates and the methods and timing of payments made under these programs. Continuing efforts of government to contain healthcare costs could materially and adversely affect us, and reimbursement levels may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or may not be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement. 
Medicare reimbursement for home health and skilled nursing services is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a "market basket update." Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ("MedPAC"), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, recommends payment policies to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations and based on previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt MedPAC's recommendations in any given year. 
Medicaid reimbursement rates for many of our assisted living and memory care communities also are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, those adjustments may not reflect actual increases of the cost of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments.
Audits and Investigations
As a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various government reviews, audits, and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. CMS has engaged a number of third party firms, including Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPIC) to conduct extensive reviews of claims data to evaluate the appropriateness of billings submitted for payment. Audit contractors may identify overpayments based on coverage requirements, billing and coding rules, or other risk areas. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities. An adverse determination of government reviews, audits, and investigations may result in citations, sanctions, other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our costs to respond to and defend any such audits, reviews, and investigations may be significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment, and any resulting sanctions or criminal, civil, or regulatory penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the "IMPACT Act"), which became law in 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post-acute care, including home health, hospice, and skilled nursing. The IMPACT Act will require such agencies and facilities to begin reporting standardized patient assessment data, new quality measures, and resource use measures. Failure to report such data when required would subject an agency or facility to a 2% reduction in market basket prices then in effect. The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and MedPAC to study and report to Congress by 2022 regarding alternative post-acute care payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting. The IMPACT Act also includes provisions impacting Medicare-certified hospices, including increasing survey frequency to once every 36 months, imposing a medical review process for facilities with a high percentage of stays in excess of 180 days, and updating the annual aggregate Medicare payment cap. 
Home Health Claim Review Demonstrations
In 2016, CMS announced that it would implement a 3-year Medicare pre-claim review demonstration for home health services in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan, and Massachusetts. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. CMS began the 
pre-claim review demonstration in Illinois in August 2016, which CMS paused in April 2017. The pre-claim review demonstration resulted in increased administrative costs and reimbursement delays for our Illinois home health agency. In December 2018, CMS indicated it was continuing the process for obtaining approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of a 5-year Medicare claim review demonstration for Illinois, which would be further expanded to Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Ohio. The Home Health Review Choice Demonstration ("RCD") was implemented on June 1, 2019 in Illinois and September 30, 2019 in Ohio. To allow home health agencies to transition to the Patient-Driven Grouping Model ("PDGM"), CMS announced in October 2019 that it was rescheduling the implementation of the RCD for the remaining states of Texas, North Carolina, and Florida. The demonstration began in Texas on March 2, 2020, and in North Carolina and Florida on August 31, 2020. CMS has stated that they will monitor the transition to PDGM and assess the need for any changes. Under the RCD, as currently proposed, providers have an initial choice of three options for review: pre-claim review, post-payment review, or minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. We derive a significant portion of our home health revenue from these states. The implementation of the RCD has adversely affected our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Home Health Value-Based Purchasing 
On January 1, 2016, CMS implemented Home Health Value-Based Purchasing ("HHVBP"). The HHVBP model was designed to give Medicare certified home health agencies incentives or penalties, through payment bonuses, to give higher quality and more efficient care. HHVBP was rolled out to nine pilot states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington, a majority of which we currently have home health operations. Bonuses and penalties began in 2018 with the maximum of plus or minus 3% and are scheduled to grow to plus or minus 8% by 2022. Payment adjustments are calculated based on performance in three process measures, nine outcome measures, five patient satisfaction measures, and three agency self-reported measures. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our home health revenue declined approximately 1% due to HHVBP and we expect an additional decline of approximately 1% during 2021. 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the "BBA"), enacted in February 2018, includes several provisions impacting Medicare reimbursement to home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy providers. With respect to home health providers, the BBA (1) bases payment on a 30-day episode of care beginning January 1, 2020, coupled with annual determinations by CMS to ensure budget neutrality (including taking into account provider behavior), (2) eliminated retroactive payment adjustments based upon the level of therapy services required beginning January 1, 2020, (3) extended the 3% add-on payment for home health services provided to residents in rural areas beginning January 1, 2018, coupled with a reduction and phase out of such add-on payment over the following four fiscal years, and (4) established a market basket update of 1.5% for the year beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to hospice providers, the BBA established a new payment policy related to early discharges to hospice care from hospitals, which imposes a financial penalty on hospitals for each early discharge to hospice care beginning October 1, 2018. With respect to outpatient therapy providers, the BBA permanently repealed the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap effective January 1, 2018 and continued the targeted medical review process with a reduction of the applicable threshold triggering such review to $3,000 effective January 1, 2018. 
CMS Final Rule 1689-FC for Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment 
Based on the CMS final rule published in September, 2019, beginning in fiscal year 2021 (as amended by the CARES Act), CMS estimated that the net impact of the payment provisions of the proposed changes would result in an increase of 1.3% in reimbursement to home health providers and finalized the methodology used to determine the rural add-on payment for 2020 through 2022 as well as regulations text changes regarding certifying and recertifying patient eligibility for Medicare home health services and remote patient monitoring. Additionally, the proposed rule includes changes to the home health prospective payment system ("HHPPS") case-mix adjustment methodology through the use of a new PDGM for home health payments. This change affected home health revenue beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and also includes a change in the unit of payment from 60-day episodes of care to 30-day episodes of care. 
Pandemic-Related Legislation
The CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, and Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, signed into law on April 24, 2020, provide liquidity and financial relief to certain businesses, among other things. The CARES Act temporarily suspended the 2% Medicare sequestration for the period May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the sequestration suspension through March 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $87.5 million under the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program administered by CMS, which was temporarily expanded by the CARES Act. Under the program, we requested acceleration/
advancement of 100% of our Medicare payment amount for a three-month period. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act, enacted on October 1, 2020, amended the repayment terms for accelerated/advanced payments. As amended, recoupment of accelerated/advanced payments will begin one year after payments were issued. Payments will be recouped at a rate of 25% of Medicare payments for the first eleven months following the anniversary of issuance and at a rate of 50% of Medicare payments for the next six months. Any outstanding balance of accelerated/advanced payments will be due following such recoupment period.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at, or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines, or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property's value and/or our assets' value. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents, retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral, or to develop or redevelop such property. Such laws impose liability for investigation, remediation, removal, and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release, or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof. We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties. 
Some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-contaminated bandages, swabs and other medical waste products, and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice, and reporting obligations. Our communities' engagement of waste management companies for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building's management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. The regulations also set forth employee training, record-keeping requirements, and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building's management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling, and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or 
operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. 
The presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon, and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation, or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan. Furthermore, the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon, and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners, operators, or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage. In some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community's market value. 
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state, and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change) could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities.
