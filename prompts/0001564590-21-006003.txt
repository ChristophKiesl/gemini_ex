Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “GEO” and the “Company” refer to The GEO Group, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and its unconsolidated affiliates, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
 General
 We are a fully-integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, leasing and management of secure facilities, processing centers and reentry facilities and the provision of community-based services and youth services in the United States, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. We own, lease and operate a broad range of secure facilities including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities, processing centers, as well as community-based reentry facilities. We develop new facilities based on contract awards, using our project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities. We provide innovative technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community based programs. We also provide secure transportation services domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture GEOAmey PECS Ltd. (“GEOAmey”). As of December 31, 2020, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately 93,000 beds at 118 secure and community-based facilities, including idle facilities, and also includes the provision of community supervision services for more than 210,000 individuals, including over 100,000 individuals through an array of technology products including radio frequency, GPS, and alcohol monitoring devices.
 We provide a diversified scope of services on behalf of our government agency partners:
  
• | our secure facility management services involve the provision of security, administrative, rehabilitation, education, and food services at secure services facilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our community based services involve supervision of individuals in community-based programs and re-entry centers and the provision of temporary housing, programming, employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our youth services include residential, shelter care and community-based services along with rehabilitative and educational programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we provide comprehensive electronic monitoring and supervision services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we develop new facilities, using our project development experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we provide secure transportation services; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | our services are provided at facilities which we either own, lease or are owned by government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. As a result of the REIT conversion, we reorganized our operations and moved non-real estate components into taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs"). We are a Florida corporation and our predecessor corporation prior to the REIT conversion was originally organized in 1984.
 Business Segments
 We conduct our business through four reportable business segments: our U.S. Secure Services segment; our GEO Care segment; our International Services segment and our Facility Construction & Design segment. We have identified these four reportable segments to reflect our current view that we operate four distinct business lines, each of which constitutes a material part of our overall business. Our U.S. Secure Services segment primarily encompasses our U.S.-based public-private partnership secure services business. Our GEO Care segment, which conducts its services in the U.S., consists of our community-based services business, our youth services business and our electronic monitoring and supervision service. Our International Services segment primarily consists of our public-private partnership secure services operations in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Our Facility Construction & Design segment primarily contracts with various states, local and federal agencies, as well as international agencies, for the design and construction of facilities for which we generally have been, or expect to be, awarded management contracts. Financial information about these segments for years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is contained in Note 15 — Business Segments and Geographic Information included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact those entrusted in our care and governmental partners. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we incurred significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic but are unable to predict the overall future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties related to the pandemic. Refer to further discussion regarding the economic impacts of COVID-19 to our operations in the Outlook section included in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Executive Order
 
On January 26, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order directing the United States Attorney General not to renew U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities, as consistent with applicable law (the “Executive Order”). Two agencies of the DOJ, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and U.S. Marshals Service (“USMS”), utilize our services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted of federal crimes, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial or sentencing in U.S. federal courts.  Our contracts with the BOP for our company-owned 1,940-bed Great Plains Correctional Facility, our company-owned 1,732-bed Big Spring Correctional Facility, our company-owned 1,800-bed Flightline Correctional Facility, and our company-owned 1,800-bed North Lake Correctional Facility have renewal option periods that expire on May 31, 2021,  November 30, 2021, November 30, 2021, and September 30, 2022, respectively. Additionally, the contracts with the BOP for the county owned and managed 1,800-bed Reeves County Detention Center I & II and the 1,376-bed Reeves County Detention Center III have renewal option periods that expire September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We have a management agreement with Reeves County, Texas for the management oversight of these two county-owned facilities. The Great Plains, Big Spring, Flightline, Northlake Correctional Facilities, Reeves County Detention Center I & II and Reeves County Detention Center III generate annualized revenues for GEO of approximately $35 million, $33 million, $35 million, $35 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively. The BOP has experienced a decline in federal prison populations over the last several years, a trend that has more recently been accelerated by the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result of the Executive Order and the decline in federal prison populations, we expect that our above described contracts with the BOP may not be renewed over the coming years. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Public-Private Partnerships.” Additionally, please refer to “Contract Expirations” below for a discussion of three other BOP contracts whose expiration we had already announced prior to the signing of the Executive Order. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our secure services contracts with the BOP accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenues.
 
Unlike the BOP, the USMS does not own and operate its detention facilities. The USMS contracts for the use of facilities, which are generally located in areas near federal courthouses, primarily through intergovernmental service agreements, and to a lesser extent, direct contracts. With respect to the USMS, the agency may determine to conduct a review of the possible application of the Executive Order on its facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our contract and agreements with the USMS accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenues.
 
President Biden’s administration may implement further executive orders or directives relating to federal criminal justice policies and immigration policies which may impact the federal government’s use of public-private partnerships with respect to correctional and detention needs, including with respect to our contracts, and/or may impact the budget and spending priorities of federal agencies, including the BOP, USMS, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). For a description of BOP, USMS and ICE facilities, please see “Business—Facilities and Day Reporting Centers.”
 
Quarterly Dividends
 
In October 2020, the GEO Board of Directors decided to reduce GEO’s quarterly cash dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend paid on October 23, 2020 from $0.48 per share, or $1.92 per share annualized, to $0.34 per share, or $1.36 per share annualized. The GEO Board of Directors took this action based on a determination that it is in the best interests of GEO and our shareholders to apply excess cash flow to debt reduction. In January 2021, the GEO Board of Directors decided to further reduce GEO’s quarterly cash dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend paid on February 1, 2021 from $0.34 per share, or $1.36 per share annualized, to $0.25 per share, or $1.00 per share annualized. The reduction of GEO’s quarterly dividend payment will allow GEO to continue its focus on paying down debt and to balance its continued creation of value for GEO shareholders with prudent management of its balance sheet. The GEO Board of Directors will continue to evaluate GEO’s dividend policy and capital allocation. The declaration of future quarterly cash dividends is subject to approval by the GEO Board of Directors and to meeting the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations. The GEO Board of Directors retains the power to modify or eliminate GEO’s quarterly dividend as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the future to consider factors including, but not limited to, long-term capital needs and access to the capital markets.

Senior Credit Facility
 
On November 6, 2020, out of an abundance of caution and as a liquidity management strategy, GEO elected to draw down $250 million in borrowings under its credit facility. In order to maintain maximum financial flexibility, GEO plans to maintain this liquidity on hand.
Contract Awards
 
On March 24, 2020, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, BI Incorporated, has signed a contract with ICE for the continued provision of case management and supervision services under the federal government’s Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (“ISAP”). The contract has a term of five years, effective April 1, 2020. Subsequently, a competitor filed a protest challenging the award of the contact. On July 8, 2020, the Government Accountability Office denied the protest and upheld the contract award.
 
We were also successful in our rebid of the continued operation of our company-owned 1,904-bed South Texas ICE Processing Center contract. The contract became effective on August 6, 2020 and has a ten-year term, inclusive of renewal options.
 
Contract Expirations
 
On June 19, 2020, GEO was notified by BOP that the BOP will not be resoliciting the 1,900 beds at GEO’s company-owned D Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, Georgia upon the expiration of the facility management contract between GEO and the BOP. The facility management contract was entered into in October 2010 with a base period of four years and with three renewal options for successive two-year periods. The third renewal period concluded on September 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, GEO entered into a four-month extension of this contract through January 31, 2021, as the BOP evaluates its future capacity needs. The facility management contract for the D Ray James Correctional Facility generated approximately $60 million in annualized revenues for GEO.
 
On November 23, 2020, GEO announced that the BOP has decided to not rebid the contract for the company-owned, 1,450-bed Rivers Correctional Facility in North Carolina, which is set to expire on March 31, 2021. The 10-year contract for the Rivers Correctional Facility generated approximately $43 million in annualized revenues for GEO. 
 
On January 20, 2021, GEO announced that the BOP has decided to not exercise the contract renewal option for the company-owned, 1,878-bed Moshannon Valley Correctional Facility in Pennsylvania, when the contract base period expires on March 31, 2021. The 10-year contract for the Moshannon Valley Correctional Facility generated approximately $42 million in annualized revenues for GEO. 
 
GEO expects to market the D. Ray James Correctional Facility, the Rivers Correctional Facility and the Moshannon Valley Correctional Facility to other federal and state agencies.
 
Idle Facilities
 In our Secure Services segment, we are currently marketing approximately 990 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $24 million at two of our idle facilities to potential customers. In our GEO Care segment, we are currently marketing approximately 1,100 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $26 million at two of our idle facilities to potential customers. The combined annual carrying cost of these idle facilities in 2021 is estimated to be $6.3 million, including depreciation expense of $2.3 million. We currently do not have any firm commitments or agreements in place to activate these facilities but have ongoing contact with several potential customers. Historically, some facilities have been idle for multiple years before they received a new contract award. The per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio. However, if the two idle facilities in our Secure Services and GEO Care segments were to be activated using our Secure Services average per diem rate in 2020, (calculated as the Secure Services revenue divided by the number of Secure Services mandays) and based on the average occupancy rate in our facilities for 2020, we would expect to receive annual incremental revenue of approximately $51 million and an increase in annual earnings per share of approximately $.02 to $.05 per share based on our average operating margin. Refer to the discussion under Executive Order and Contract Expirations above for discussion of recent developments.
 Quality of Operations
 We operate each facility in accordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the standards and guidelines required under the relevant management contract. For many facilities, the standards and guidelines include those established by the American Correctional Association, or (“ACA”). The ACA is an independent organization of corrections professionals, which establishes correctional facility standards and guidelines that are generally acknowledged as a benchmark by governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities. Many of our contracts in the United States require us to seek and maintain ACA accreditation for our facilities. We have sought and received ACA accreditation and re-accreditation for all such facilities. We achieved a median re-accreditation score of 100% as of 
 5


December 31, 2020. Approximately 89% of our 2020 U.S. Secure Services revenue was derived from ACA accredited facilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have also achieved and maintained accreditation by The Joint Commission at five of our secure service facilities and at seven of our youth services locations. We have been successful in achieving and maintaining accreditation under the National Commission on Correctional Health Care ("NCCHC") in a majority of the facilities that we currently operate. The NCCHC accreditation is a voluntary process which we have used to establish comprehensive health care policies and procedures to meet and adhere to the ACA standards. The NCCHC standards, in most cases, exceed ACA Health Care Standards and we have achieved this accreditation at 14 of our U.S. Secure Services facilities and at one youth services location. Additionally, B.I. Incorporated ("BI") has achieved a certification for ISO 9001:2008 for the design, production, installation and servicing of products and services produced by the electronic monitoring business units, including electronic home arrest and electronic monitoring technology products and monitoring services, installation services, and automated caseload management services.
 Corporate Social Responsibility
 In September 2020, we issued our second Human Rights and ESG report. The Human Rights and ESG report builds on the important milestone we achieved in 2013 when our Board adopted a Global Human Rights Policy by providing disclosures related to how we inform our employees of our commitment to respecting human rights; the criteria we use to assess human rights performance; and our contract compliance program, remedies to shortcomings in human rights performance, and independent verification of our performance by third party organizations. The Human Rights and ESG report also addresses criteria, based on recognized ESG reporting standards, related to the development of our employees; our efforts to advance environmental sustainability in the construction and operation of our facilities; and our adherence to ethical governance practices throughout our company. The report covers the year ended December 31, 2019 with supporting data from 2017-2019 where possible. The report showcases, among other items, our company wide awareness and training programs, our commitment to a safe and humane environment for everyone in our care, employee diversity, addressing recidivism through our GEO Continuum of Care, our engagement efforts with our stakeholders, oversight and contract compliance, conservation measures and enhanced environmental sustainability efforts.
 The Human Rights and Environmental, Social and Governance, (“ESG”) report was prepared with reference to the GRI Standards related to General Disclosures, Economic Topics, Environmental Topics and Social Topics based on the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, issued by the Global Sustainability Standards Board and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. GRI is an international independent standards organization created to help business, government and other organizations understand and communicate how their operations affect issues of global importance, such as human rights, corruption and climate change. We have referenced the GRI Standards and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as we have recognized the need for a transparent and disciplined enterprise-wide approach. In our pursuit of this approach, we have begun with the following set of ongoing objectives:
  
• | Provide greater transparency for our stakeholders and the general public with respect to our various efforts in all our facilities aimed at respecting human rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our ability to flag potential issues in all areas of our operations and compress the time it takes to respond with corrective measures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use widely accepted methodologies for evaluating performance and setting objectives for improvements in corporate governance, corporate social policy, environmental impact and energy conservation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ESG report may be accessed on our website under "Investors-Latest Reports-Latest ESG Report." The information included in the Human Rights and ESG report is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Business Development Overview
 Our primary potential customers include: governmental agencies responsible for local, state and federal secure facilities in the United States; governmental agencies responsible for secure facilities in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; federal, state and local government agencies in the United States responsible for community-based services for adult and juvenile offenders; federal, state and local government agencies responsible for monitoring community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; and other foreign governmental agencies. We achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal, or RFP. We primarily rely on the RFP process for organic growth in our U.S. and international secure services operations as well as in our community based reentry services and electronic monitoring services business.
 For our facility management contracts, our state and local experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between one and four months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between one and four months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable.

For our facility management contracts, our federal experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between 12 and 18 months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between four and 18 weeks elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable.
 If the local, state or federal facility for which an award has been made must be constructed, our experience is that construction usually takes between nine and 24 months to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the project. Therefore, management of a newly constructed facility typically commences between 10 and 28 months after the governmental agency’s award.
 For the services provided by BI, local, state and federal experience has been that a period of approximately 30 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of an RFP or Invitation to Bid, or ITB, to the submission of our response; that between one and three months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between one and three months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of a program or the implementation of program operations, as applicable.
 The term of our local, state and federal contracts range from one to five years and some contracts include provisions for optional renewal terms beyond the initial contract term. Contracts can, and are periodically, extended beyond the initial contract term and optional renewal terms through alternative procurement processes including sole source justification processes, cooperative procurement vehicles and agency decisions to add extension time periods.
 We believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective customers when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts. 
  We also plan to leverage our experience and scale of service offerings to expand the range of public-private partnership services that we provide. We have engaged and intend in the future to engage independent consultants to assist us in developing public-private partnership opportunities and in responding to requests for proposals, monitoring the legislative and business climate, and maintaining relationships with existing customers.
 Facility Design, Construction and Finance
 We offer governmental agencies consultation and management services relating to the design and construction of new secure facilities and the redesign and renovation of older facilities including facilities we own, lease or manage as well as facilities we do not own, lease or manage. Domestically, as of December 31, 2020, we have provided services for the design and construction of approximately 57 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of approximately 78 facilities. Internationally, as of December 31, 2020, we have provided services for the design and construction of 11 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of two facilities.
 Contracts to design and construct or to redesign and renovate facilities may be financed in a variety of ways. Governmental agencies may finance the construction of such facilities through any of the following methods:
  
• | a one time general revenue appropriation by the governmental agency for the cost of the new facility;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general obligation bonds that are secured by either a limited or unlimited tax levy by the issuing governmental entity; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | revenue bonds or certificates of participation secured by an annual lease payment that is subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may also act as a source of financing or as a facilitator with respect to the financing of the construction of a facility. In these cases, the construction of such facilities may be financed through various methods including the following:
  
• | funds from equity offerings of our stock;
--+------------------------------------------


• | cash on hand and/or cash flows from our operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | borrowings by us from banks or other institutions (which may or may not be subject to government guarantees in the event of contract termination);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | funds from debt offerings of our notes; or
--+-------------------------------------------


• | lease arrangements with third parties.
--+---------------------------------------

 7



If the project is financed using direct governmental appropriations, with proceeds of the sale of bonds or other obligations issued prior to the award of the project, then financing is in place when the contract relating to the construction or renovation project is executed. If the project is financed using project-specific tax-exempt bonds or other obligations, the construction contract is generally subject to the sale of such bonds or obligations. Generally, substantial expenditures for construction will not be made on such a project until the tax-exempt bonds or other obligations are sold; and, if such bonds or obligations are not sold, construction and therefore, management of the facility, may either be delayed until alternative financing is procured or the development of the project will be suspended or entirely canceled. If the project is self-financed by us, then financing is generally in place prior to the commencement of construction.
 Under our construction and design management contracts, we generally agree to be responsible for overall project development and completion. We typically act as the primary developer on construction contracts for facilities and subcontract with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors. Where possible, we subcontract with construction companies that we have worked with previously. We make use of an in-house staff of architects and operational experts from various service disciplines (e.g. security, medical service, food service, programs and facility maintenance) as part of the team that participates from conceptual design through final construction of the project. This staff coordinates all aspects of the development with subcontractors and provides site-specific services.
 When designing a facility, our architects use, with appropriate modifications, prototype designs we have used in developing prior projects. We believe that the use of these designs allows us to reduce the potential of cost overruns and construction delays, thus controlling costs both to construct and to manage the facility. Our facility designs also maintain security because they increase the area under direct surveillance by correctional officers and make use of additional electronic surveillance.
 
Competitive Strengths
 Attractive REIT Profile
 We believe the key characteristics of our business make us a highly attractive REIT. We are in a real estate intensive industry. Since our inception, we have financed and developed dozens of facilities. We have a diversified set of investment grade customers in the form of government agencies which are required to pay us on time by law. Our occupancy rates have historically generated a stable and sustainable stream of revenue. The REIT structure also allows us to pursue growth opportunities due to the capital-intensive nature of our business.
 Long-Term Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers
 We have developed long-term relationships with our federal, state and other governmental customers, which we believe enhance our ability to win new contracts and retain existing business. We have provided secure management services to the United States Federal Government for 34 years, the State of California for 32 years, prior to the new California law AB 32 that went into effect on January 1, 2020 (aimed at phasing out public-private partnership contracts for the operation of secure facilities within California and facilities outside of the State of California housing State of California inmates), the State of Texas for approximately 33 years, various Australian state government entities for 29 years and the State of Florida for approximately 27 years. These customers accounted for approximately 73% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
 Recurring Revenue with Strong Cash Flow
 Our revenue base has historically been derived from our long-term customer relationships. We have historically been able to expand our revenue base by continuing to reinvest our strong operating cash flow into expansionary projects and through strategic acquisitions that provide scale and further enhance our service offerings. Our consolidated revenues have grown to $2.4 billion in 2020. We expect our operating cash flow to be well in excess of our anticipated annual maintenance capital expenditure needs, which would provide us significant flexibility for the repayment of indebtedness and future dividend payments in connection with operating as a REIT.
Sizeable International Business
 Our international infrastructure, which leverages our operational excellence in the U.S., allows us to aggressively target foreign opportunities that our U.S. based competitors without overseas operations may have difficulty pursuing. We currently have international operations in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Our international services business, including our facility construction and design business currently in Australia, generated approximately $227.5 million of revenues, representing approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in our international revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018 are construction revenues related to the expansion of our Fulham facility in Victoria, Australia which are also presented in our Facility Design & Construction segment. We believe we are well positioned to continue benefiting from foreign governments’ initiatives to enter into public-private partnerships for secure services.

Experienced, Proven Senior Management Team
 Our Chief Executive Officer and founder, George C. Zoley, Ph.D., has led our Company for 36 years and has established a track record of growth and profitability. Under his leadership, our annual consolidated revenues from operations have grown from $207.0 million in 1997 to $2.4 billion in 2020. Dr. Zoley is one of the pioneers of the industry, having developed and opened what we believe to be one of the first public-private partnership secure services facilities in the U.S. in 1986. Our Chief Financial Officer, Brian R. Evans, has been with our Company for over 20 years and led our conversion to a REIT as well as the integration of our recent acquisitions and financing activities. Our top seven senior executives have an average tenure with our Company of over 10 years.
Business Strategies
 Provide High Quality, Comprehensive Services and Cost Savings Throughout the Corrections Lifecycle
 Our objective is to provide federal, state and local governmental agencies with a comprehensive offering of high quality, essential services at a lower cost than they themselves could achieve. We believe government agencies facing budgetary constraints will increasingly seek to outsource a greater proportion of their correctional needs to reliable providers that can enhance quality of service at a reduced cost. We believe our expanded and diversified service offerings uniquely position us to bundle our high quality services and provide a comprehensive continuum of care for our clients, which we believe will lead to lower cost outcomes for our clients and larger scale business opportunities for us.
Maintain Disciplined Operating Approach
 We refrain from pursuing contracts that we do not believe will yield attractive profit margins in relation to the associated operational risks. In addition, although we engage in facility development from time to time without having a corresponding management contract award in place, we endeavor to do so only where we have determined that there is medium to long-term client demand for a facility in that geographical area. We have also elected not to enter certain international markets with a history of economic and political instability. We believe that our strategy of emphasizing lower risk and higher profit opportunities helps us to consistently deliver strong operational performance, lower our costs and increase our overall profitability.
Pursue International Growth Opportunities
 As a global provider of public-private partnership secure services, we are able to capitalize on opportunities to operate existing or new facilities on behalf of foreign governments. We have seen increased business development opportunities including opportunities to cross sell our expanded service offerings in recent years in the international markets in which we operate. We will continue to actively bid on new international projects in our current markets and in new markets that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk.
Selectively Pursue Acquisition Opportunities
 We intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that fit our strategic objectives and enhance our geographic platform and service offerings. Since 2005, and including the acquisitions of Community Education Centers, Protocol Criminal Justice, Inc., Soberlink, Inc. and the correctional and detention facilities of LCS Corrections Services, Inc. we have completed nine acquisitions for total consideration, including debt assumed, in excess of $2.0 billion. Our management team utilizes a disciplined approach to analyze and evaluate acquisition opportunities, which we believe has contributed to our success in completing and integrating our acquisitions.
Intellectual Property and Patents
 We have numerous United States and foreign patents issued as well as a number of United States patents pending in the electronic monitoring space. These patents protect our intellectual property rights and provide us with a competitive advantage by seeking to prevent our competitors from duplicating our technology and/or products in the electronic monitoring line of business. The remaining duration of our patents range from 18 months to 20 years.

(1) | Capacity as used in the table refers to operational capacity consisting of total beds for all facilities except for certain Non-Residential Service Centers under Youth Services for which we have provided service capacity which represents the number of juveniles that can be serviced daily.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | For Youth Services Non-Residential Service Centers, the contract commencement date represents either the program start date or the date that the facility operations were acquired by our subsidiary. The service agreements under these arrangements provide for services on an as-contracted basis and there are no guaranteed minimum populations or management contracts with specified renewal dates. These arrangements are more perpetual in nature. For acquired operations, the commencement date is the original date of contract.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | GEO provides services at these facilities through various Inter-Governmental Agreements, or IGAs, through the various counties and other jurisdictions.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The contract for this facility only requires GEO to provide maintenance services.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | The Colorado Day Reporting Centers provide many of the same services as the full-service Day Reporting Centers, but rather than providing these services through comprehensive treatment plans dictated by the governing authority, these services are provided on a fee for service basis. Such services may be connected to government agency contracts and would be reimbursed by those agencies. Other services are offered directly to offenders allowing them to meet court-ordered requirements and are paid by the offender as the service is provided.

Government Contracts — Terminations, Renewals and Competitive Re-bids
 Generally, we may lose our facility management contracts due to one of three reasons: the termination by a government customer with or without cause at any time; the failure by a customer to renew a contract with us upon the expiration of the then current term; or our failure to 
 18


win the right to continue to operate under a contract that has been competitively re-bid in a procurement process upon its termination or expiration. Our facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days. If government agencies were to use these provisions to terminate, or renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Risk Factors — “We are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts, due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers”.
 Aside from our customers’ unilateral right to terminate our facility management contracts with them at any time for any reason, there are two points during the typical lifecycle of a contract which may result in the loss by us of a facility management contract with our customers. We refer to these points as contract “renewals” and contract “re-bids.” Many of our facility management contracts with our government customers have an initial fixed term and subsequent renewal rights for one or more additional periods at the unilateral option of the customer. Because most of our contracts for youth services do not guarantee placement or revenue, we have not considered these contracts to ever be in the renewal or re-bid stage since they are more perpetual in nature. As such, the contracts for youth services are not considered as renewals or re-bids nor are they included in the table below. We count each government customer’s right to renew a particular facility management contract for an additional period as a separate “renewal.” For example, a five-year initial fixed term contract with customer options to renew for five separate additional one-year periods would, if fully exercised, be counted as five separate renewals, with one renewal coming in each of the five years following the initial term. As of December 31, 2020, 54 of our facility management contracts representing approximately 40,000 beds are scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2021, unless renewed by the customer at its sole option in certain cases, or unless renewed by mutual agreement in other cases. These contracts represented approximately 33% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We undertake substantial efforts to renew our facility management contracts. Our average historical facility management contract renewal rate approximates 90%. However, given their unilateral nature, we cannot assure you that our customers will in fact exercise their renewal options under existing contracts. In addition, in connection with contract renewals, either we or the contracting government agency have typically requested changes or adjustments to contractual terms. As a result, contract renewals may be made on terms that are more or less favorable to us than those in existence prior to the renewals.
 We define competitive re-bids as contracts currently under our management which we believe, based on our experience with the customer and the facility involved, will be re-bid to us and other potential service providers in a competitive procurement process upon the expiration or termination of our contract, assuming all renewal options are exercised. Our determination of which contracts we believe will be competitively re-bid may in some cases be subjective and judgmental, based largely on our knowledge of the dynamics involving a particular contract, the customer and the facility involved. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial fixed term plus any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract by a customer. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to encourage competitive pricing and other terms for the government customer. Potential bidders in competitive re-bid situations include us, other private operators and other government entities. While we are pleased with our historical win rate on competitive re-bids and are committed to continuing to bid competitively on appropriate future competitive re-bid opportunities, we cannot in fact assure you that we will prevail in future competitive re-bid situations. Also, we cannot assure you that any competitive re-bids we win will be on terms more favorable to us than those in existence with respect to the expiring contract.
 As of December 31, 2020, 22 of our facility management contracts as well as certain of our other management contracts that are also subject to competitive re-bid may be subject to competitive re-bid in 2021. These contracts in the aggregate represented 10% and approximately $239 million of our 2020 consolidated revenues. The following table sets forth the number of facility management contracts that we currently believe will be subject to competitive re-bid in each of the next five years and thereafter, and the total number of beds relating to those potential competitive re-bid situations during each period:
 
 
Year | Re-bid | | Total Number of Beds up for Re-bid
-----------+--------+-----+-----------------------------------
2021 | | 22 | | 11,847
2022 | | 12 | | 5,485 
2023 | | 8 | | 3,910 
2024 | | 16 | | 1,031 
2025 | | 12 | | 7,460 
Thereafter | | 36 | | 33,881
Total | | 106 | | 63,614

Competition
 We compete primarily on the basis of the quality and range of services we offer; our experience domestically and internationally in the design, construction, and management of public-private partnerships for secure service facilities; our reputation; and our pricing. We compete 
 19


directly with the public sector, where governmental agencies responsible for the operation of secure services, processing services, youth services, community-based services and reentry facilities are often seeking to retain projects that might otherwise become a public-private partnership. In the private sector, our U.S. Secure Services and International Services business segments compete with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: Core Civic; Management and Training Corporation; Emerald Companies; LaSalle Southwest Corrections; Group 4 Securicor; Sodexo Justice Services (formerly Kaylx); and Serco. Our GEO Care business segment competes with a number of different small-to-medium sized companies, reflecting the highly fragmented nature of the youth services and community based services industry. BI’s electronic monitoring business competes with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: G4 Justice Services, LLC and 3M Electronic Monitoring, a 3M Company. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance.
 Human Capital Resources
 
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
 
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 20,000 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, approximately 430 were employed at our corporate headquarters and regional offices and approximately 20,000 were employed at facilities and international offices. We employ personnel in positions of management, administrative and clerical, security, educational services, human resource services, health services and general maintenance at our various locations. 
 Approximately 6,000 and 1,400 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the United States and at international offices, respectively. GEO welcomes the participation of labor unions in our facilities and respects the rights of individual employees to choose whether or not to join labor organizations. We actively participate in the collective bargaining process, negotiate in good faith and maintain excellent working relationships with each of the unions representing our employees. As a result, over the years, GEO has not experienced any significant or major labor actions, such as strikes or work stoppages.
 Training
 GEO has a robust training program for staff at all levels of the organization. Our training of managerial, administrative, and security staff is based on the standards set by the American Correctional Association. Training includes classroom learning, practical exercises, course examinations, and on-the-job training. GEO’s corporate policy also mandates that every new employee receive orientation training prior to undertaking any assignments
 Under the laws applicable to most of our operations, and internal company policies, our correctional officers are required to complete a minimum amount of training. We generally require at least 40 hours of pre-service training before an employee is allowed to assume their duties plus an additional 120 hours of training during their first year of employment in our domestic facilities, consistent with ACA standards and/or applicable state laws. In addition to the usual 160 hours of training in the first year, most states require 40 or 80 hours of on-the-job training. Florida law requires that correctional officers receive 520 hours of training. We believe that our training programs meet or exceed all applicable requirements.
 Our training program for domestic facilities typically begins with approximately 40 hours of instruction regarding our policies, operational procedures and management philosophy. Training continues with an additional 120 hours of instruction covering legal issues, rights of individuals within our care, techniques of communication and supervision, interpersonal skills and job training relating to the particular position to be held. Each of our employees who has contact with individuals within our care receives a minimum of 40 hours of additional training each year, and each manager receives at least 24 hours of training each year.
 At least 160 hours of training are required for our employees in Australia and South Africa before such employees are allowed to work in positions that will bring them into contact with individuals within our care. Our employees in Australia and South Africa receive a minimum of 40 hours of refresher training each year. In the United Kingdom, our corrections employees also receive a minimum of 240 hours prior to coming in contact with individuals within our care and receive additional training of approximately 25 hours annually.
 With respect to BI and the ISAP services contract, new employees are required to complete training requirements as outlined in the contract within 14 days of hire and prior to being assigned autonomous ISAP related duties. These employees receive 25 hours of refresher training annually thereafter. Program managers for our ISAP contract must receive 24 hours of additional initial training. BI’s monitoring services maintains its own comprehensive certification and training program for all monitoring service specialists. We require all new personnel hired for a position in monitoring operations to complete a seven-week training program. Successful completion of our training 
 20


program and a final certification is required of all of our personnel performing monitoring operations. We require that certification is achieved prior to being permitted to work independently in the call center.
 Health, wellness and employee resources
 GEO’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across businesses and geographies. GEO offers a comprehensive employee benefits program that is competitive for each of the various locations in which we operate across the United States which are designed to develop, attract and retain personnel. The variety of our benefit offerings is designed to provide individual employees with the flexibility to choose coverage options and benefits that best meet their needs and address their priorities 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities across the United States and around the world, our employees have also been impacted by the spread of COVID-19. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees and all those in our care has always been our number one priority. We advise our employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms, and we have exercised and continue to exercise flexible paid leave and paid time off policies to allow for employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms or to care for a family member.
 
Career Growth and Development
 
GEO employees and their family members (parent, spouse and child) are eligible to further pursue their educational goals by receiving reduced tuition rates on a variety of accredited on-line degree programs in business, education, healthcare and other disciplines provided at 14 different higher educational institutions. A tuition reimbursement program is also available for GEO employees pursuing their education as they work to develop their skills and enhance their job performance. Tuition reimbursement is provided to eligible employees for courses offered by accredited colleges, universities, and secretarial and trade schools. Separately, GEO’s subsidiary, BI Incorporated, offers an education assistance program to its full-time employees with at least one year of service. Employees who enroll in the program are eligible to receive up to $3,500 a year in tuition reimbursement.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
In all areas of our business, GEO strives to achieve wider racial and ethnic diversity. In 2020, two of our board seats were held by members of minority communities. Across our organization, under-represented minorities of the United States of America – including African Americans, Hispanic and Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian and Native American/Alaskan – currently account for 64% of our U.S. employees. Minorities comprise 42% of GEO’s corporate workforce, 70% of our facility security staff, and 29% of those serving in management positions as directors or above.
 
Additionally, women comprise an equal portion of GEO’s U.S. workforce and play a significant role in our leadership and management. Women are also involved at the highest levels of our organization. Of the nine members of GEO’s Board of Directors in 2020, two are women. In 2018, the organization 2020 Women on Boards recognized GEO Group as a Winning Company for its commitment to board diversity. Winning Companies champion board diversity by having 20% or more of their board seats held by women. This marked the fourth consecutive year in which GEO had been recognized by 2020 Women on Boards, whose goal is to increase the percentage of women on all corporate boards to 20 percent by 2020.
 Business Regulations and Legal Considerations
 Many governmental agencies are required to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts for products or services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract or partner with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups.
 Certain states, such as Florida, deem correctional officers to be peace officers and require our personnel to be licensed and subject to background investigation. State law also typically requires correctional officers to meet certain training standards.
 The failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the loss of any required license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our current and future operations may be subject to additional regulations as a result of, among other factors, new statutes and regulations and changes in the manner in which existing statutes and regulations are or may be interpreted or applied. Any such additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Insurance
 The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoner’s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale.
 We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $70.0 million per occurrence and $90 million in total general liability annual aggregate limits covering the operations of U.S. Secure Services, GEO Care's community-based services, GEO Care's youth services and BI. We have a claims-made liability insurance program with a specific loss limit of $40.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate related to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services. We are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers’ compensation, environmental liability and cybersecurity liability.
 For most casualty insurance policies, we carry substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $3.0 million per occurrence for general liability and medical professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value.
 With respect to our operations in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia, we utilize a combination of locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and to protect us. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract.
 Of the reserves discussed above, our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers’ compensation, general liability and auto claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $78.9 million and $68.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets. We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
 International Operations
 Our international operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the operations of our wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries, our wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, and South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited, our consolidated joint venture in South Africa, which we refer to as SACM. In Australia, our wholly owned subsidiary, GEO Australia, currently manages three facilities. We operate one facility in South Africa through SACM. Our wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, The GEO Group UK Ltd., operates the 217-bed Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre located near Glasgow, Scotland. See Item 7 for more discussion related to the results of our international operations. Financial information about our operations in different geographic regions appears in Note-15 Business Segments and Geographic Information in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Business Concentration
 Except for the major customers noted in the following table, no other single customer made up greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for these years.
 
 
Customer | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2018
-------------------------------------------------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
Various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government: | | 56 | % | | 53 | % | 50 | %

 
Credit risk related to accounts receivable is reflective of the related revenues. The margins on our federal contracts are above the company average due to the fact that they are company-owned facilities.
