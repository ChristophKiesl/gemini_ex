We utilize third-party distributors for the retail channel in countries where we do not have subsidiaries.
Our goal is to provide universal control solutions that require minimal or no user set-up and deliver consistent and intuitive one-touch control of all connected content sources and devices. QuickSet® ("QuickSet") is a software application that is currently embedded or enabled via a cloud service in over 550 million devices worldwide. QuickSet may be embedded in an AV device, set-top box, or other host device, or delivered as a cloud-based service to enable universal remote setup and control. QuickSet enables universal device control set-up using automated and guided on-screen instructions and a wireless two-way communication link between the remote and the QuickSet enabled device. The two-way connection allows device control code data and configuration settings to be sent to the remote control from the device and greatly simplifies the universal control set-up process and can enable other time-saving features. QuickSet utilizes data transmitted over HDMI or Internet Protocol ("IP") networks to automatically detect various attributes of the connected device and downloads the appropriate control codes and functions into the remote control without the need for the user to enter any additional information. With QuickSet, consumers switch easily between activities and reliably view their chosen content source with a single touch. A QuickSet user experience can be delivered via a tactile remote, touchscreen interface, on-screen graphical user interface or voice-enabled system. Licensees of QuickSet include service providers such as Comcast, Charter Communications, AT&T and Dish Network Corporation; smart TV manufacturers such as Sony Corporation, LG and Samsung; and leading game console manufacturers such as Microsoft Corporation on its Xbox One game system and Sony PlayStation on its PlayStation 5 remote control.
QuickSet Cloud is an end-to-end platform for discovery, control, and interaction with devices including rules and automation framework for a truly connected home experience. UEI has developed one of the largest knowledge graphs of devices on the market, enabling a broad array of connected device information to be collected. Through our QuickSet Cloud and QuickSet SDK delivery methods, we can offer the advantage of edge intelligence built in, as well as the benefits of a cloud-scalable solution.
Our technology pipeline has expanded to include an artificial intelligence platform, nevo.ai, that enables a digital assistant for the connected home with a natural language interface to allow interaction with devices within the home using QuickSet's underlying capabilities. For example, our newest product platform, Nevo Butler, offers a turnkey smart home hub with nevo.ai and QuickSet pre-integrated. Nevo Butler delivers a managed hardware with security built-in capable of supporting other digital assistants. We are engaged with several customers, across different channels, that are currently using our underlying technologies, such as our proprietary microcontrollers, nevo.ai and QuickSet in their devices.
We continue to evolve our hardware and software solutions by adding new features and capabilities to ensure added value. Through our cloud service platforms, QuickSet Cloud and nevo.ai, we also offer Interoperability as a Service, a managed Internet of Things ("IoT") service which ensures compatibility across the most common devices found in consumers' homes. Features are further expandable through enterprise integration with an ecosystem of third party partner services.
In 2018, we won a Technical & Engineering Emmy® Award from The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for our work relating to voice navigation technologies for discovering and interacting with TV content. We were selected for our excellence in engineering and creativity that has materially affected the television viewing experience.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our sales to Comcast accounted for 20.1%, 15.9% and 17.6% of our net sales, respectively. 
Markets and Competition
We continue to place significant emphasis on expanding our sales and marketing efforts to video service providers and home entertainment OEMs in Asia, Latin America and Europe. In the markets for video services we include cable, satellite, IPTV and OTT service providers. In recent years, we have seen a significant change in our markets with the rise of the direct-to-consumer streaming video apps that are enabled on smart TVs and streaming devices as well as advanced set-top boxes. This has resulted in a change in mix in our customer base, especially in the U.S., where our traditional customers in cable and satellite have been complimented with new customers in the digital media streaming domain. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced an MFi-certified, AppleTV remote control for the Multichannel Video Programming Distributor ("MVPD") market allowing subscribers access to subscription-based channels through an OTT streaming platform, such as AppleTV.
Additionally, some of our current customers have successfully introduced media streaming services and expanded their footprint to new end-users. Tivo Stream, Comcast Flex and Dish Sling are examples of current customer offerings of these types of services.
At the same time, we have seen our markets in Home Entertainment OEM, and especially our smartTV OEMs, successfully upgrade to streaming service aggregators. The advanced TV interfaces on Smart TVs and related streaming devices offer platforms for personalized advertising and smart home services which is expected to ensure demand for our wireless and wired control products, microcontrollers and software technology.
Our principal competitors in the home entertainment market are Remote Solutions, Omni Remotes, SMK, Ohsung, Tech4Home and Ruwido. In the international retail and private label markets for wireless controls we compete primarily with the remote segment of Logitech and accessory trading and branding companies like Jasco and Hama, as well as various manufacturers of wireless controls in Asia. Our primary competitors in the OEM market are the OEMs themselves and various wireless control manufacturers in Asia. 
Leveraging our scale and expertise in low-power RF microcontrollers, we continue to pursue further penetration of the more traditional OEM consumer electronics markets as well as newer product categories in the smart home and IoT markets such as lighting, window coverings, and bathroom controllers. Customers in these markets integrate our connectivity and cloud-based solutions, services and technology into their products to enhance their consumer lifestyle ecosystems. Growth in these markets has been driven by the increasing demand for more energy efficient homes, consumer convenience and the increasing proliferation of connected devices.
In home security, safety and automation, we offer universal sub-gigahertz products that are compatible with the top security panel manufacturers, such as Honeywell, GE, Tyco/DSC and 2GIG.

We also introduced a new service platform (UEI Virtual Agent) for easier device onboarding, identification and troubleshooting across our portfolio of control products.
Our personnel are involved with various industry organizations and bodies, which are in the process of setting standards for IR and RF communication and networking in the home. Because of the nature of research and development ("R&D") activities, there can be no assurance that any of our R&D projects will be successfully completed or ultimately achieve commercial success.
Intellectual Property and Technology
A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment devices is our proprietary device knowledge graph. Since our founding in 1986, we have compiled an extensive device control library that includes nearly 13,000 brands comprising over 930,000 device models across AV and smart home platforms, supported by many common smart home protocols, including IR, HDMI-CEC, Zigbee (Rf4CE), Z-Wave, IP, as well as Home Network and Cloud Control.
We have developed a broad portfolio of patented technologies and the industry's leading database of device setup and control software. We ship integrated circuits, on which our software and control code libraries are embedded and that connect to our cloud services, directly to manufacturers for inclusion in their products. In addition, we license our software and technology to manufacturers. 
Our technology also includes other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, as well as wired Consumer Electronics Control ("CEC") and wireless IP control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for many home entertainment and automation devices in the home. Our libraries are continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV and IoT devices. These control codes are captured directly from original control devices or from the manufacturer's written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the library. Our proprietary software and know-how permit us to offer a device control code database that is more robust and efficient than similarly priced products from our competitors.
This device knowledge graph is backed by our unique device fingerprinting technology which includes over 8.3 million unique device fingerprints across both AV and Smart Home devices.
Smart devices are becoming a more prevalent part of the home entertainment experience, and we offer several solutions to enable entertainment device control via a smart phone, tablet, smart TV or smart speaker or digital assistant. In our smart device 
control solutions, we offer the elements needed for device control ranging from IR and RF controller chips to device control libraries to graphical and voice user interfaces, as well as artificial intelligence systems that deliver context aware device interactions. 
We hold a number of patents in the United States and abroad related to our products and technology, and have filed domestic and foreign applications for other patents that are pending. At the end of 2020, we had nearly 600 issued and pending United States patents related to remote control, home security, safety and automation as well as hundreds of foreign counterpart patents and applications in various territories around the world.
Our patents have remaining lives ranging from one to 18 years. We have also obtained copyright registration and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and libraries of our device control codes. Additionally, the names of many of our products are registered, or are being registered, as trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in most of the other countries in which such products are sold. These registrations are valid for terms ranging up to 20 years and may be renewed as long as the trademarks continue to be used and are deemed by management to be important to our operations. While we follow the practice of obtaining patent, copyright and trademark registrations on new developments whenever advisable, in certain cases we have elected common law trade secret protection in lieu of obtaining such other protection.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently own and operate vertically integrated manufacturing and assembly factories in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil, which allow us to produce in the regional markets and to scale our production to meet growing demand. In 2018, we began conversion of our Mexico refurbishment plant into a full manufacturing and assembly factory. This conversion was substantially completed by the third quarter of 2019. We also use third-party manufacturing partners in the Far East, such as Vietnam.
We utilize our own manufacturing plants and third-party manufacturers and suppliers primarily to produce our control and sensor products. In 2020, Qorvo International Pte Ltd. provided 14.2% of our total inventory purchases. In 2019 and 2018, no single supplier provided more than 10% of our total inventory purchases. 
Even though we operate two factories in the PRC and manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico and Brazil, we continue to evaluate additional contract manufacturers and sources of supply. During 2020, we utilized multiple contract manufacturers and maintained duplicate tooling for certain of our products. Where possible we utilize standard parts and components, which are available from multiple sources. 
Our manufacturing process consists of plastic injection, keypad molding, coating or painting, surface mounting of printed circuit boards, assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 International Standard for quality management. Testing and quality control are applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. Our factories in the PRC are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems. In addition, our manufacturing facilities in Yangzhou, PRC have also achieved ISO 45001 International Standard for safety and health management systems with one of the facilities successfully completing the Validated Audit Process with the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"). We are focused on reducing the impact of our operations on the environment; and our teams continue to examine practices and processes throughout our facilities to identify opportunities for greater efficiency. Each of our manufacturing facilities has standing policies and/or guidelines for the monitoring and management of energy consumption, and continually strives for reduction in electricity and water usage. 
In addition to requiring observance to strict quality standards by our suppliers, we maintain and require our suppliers to adhere to a robust Global Supplier Code of Conduct, which is available on our website. As part of the initial qualification and ongoing audit process, our dedicated Global Supplier Quality Management Team examines a supplier's social and environmental responsiveness in areas such as labor practice, occupational health and safety, and environmental protection. Additionally, we are committed to a conflict-free mineral supply chain.
We continually seek additional sources to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuit suppliers. To further manage our integrated system on a chip supplier dependence, we include microcontroller technology which incorporates non-volatile, reprogrammable flash memory in most of our products. Flash memory-based microcontrollers have shorter lead times than microcontrollers using other memory technologies and may be reprogrammed, if necessary. This allows us flexibility to use a given component on many different products, has the added benefit of potentially reducing excess and obsolete inventory 
exposure and allows us to update our product functionality in the field. This diversification lessens our dependence on any one supplier and allows us to negotiate more favorable terms.
We are also a large consumer of low-power, RF chips and modules that are used throughout our product portfolios, including many of our remotes, sensors and thermostats.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including laws regulating the manufacturing and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damages or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products.
We may also face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Our European subsidiaries are WEEE compliant. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the PRC, India and Japan.
We believe that we have materially complied with all currently existing international and domestic federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which we are subject. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the costs incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. In addition, during the same period, the costs incurred in complying with other applicable government regulations likewise did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, may give rise to additional compliance costs that may have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or financial condition.
We are committed to reducing and eliminating substances of concern from our products and manufacturing process. Our products distributed in the European Union are compliant with the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) directives. In other regions, we also need to comply with our customers' specific requirements relating to the non-use of certain hazardous substances in the products, which are typically equally or more stringent than the RoHS directive. We have a dedicated "Green Team" based in the PRC and in-house testing capability to ensure product compliance. At our manufacturing facilities, we are also committed to protecting our workers from exposure to hazardous substances under an established health and safety management system; for example, we strive to have our facilities be free of lead and the substances banned by RoHS. We also place great importance in strict compliance of local health and safety laws and regulations.
We strive to extend the useful life of our products and reduce our products' impact on the environment. For example, we deploy a low energy IR-engine in some of our products which can extend battery life regardless of the protocols utilized by the product. We also offer a robust product refurbishment program to our customers where we reclaim, refurbish and recycle pre-owned remote controls. Under this program, substantially all of the materials in a pre-owned remote control unit are reused or recycled; for example, used plastics and silicon are ground and reused in other products. We have also employed new master carton packing methods to increase shipping efficiency and reduce cardboard usage. Some of our manufacturing facilities are switching to the use of recycled solder. We are also looking for ways to reduce the use of single-use plastics in our products and packaging.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we employed 3,839 members of staff across our worldwide facilities. Of this staff, 2,362 members are associated with our manufacturing and supply chain organizations in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil. In the PRC we are working with external agencies to recruit staff to support our production activities where 3,866 staff members are contracted through agency agreements. Beyond the manufacturing and supply chain organizations, 1,064 members of staff work in engineering and R&D, 109 work in sales and marketing, 33 work in consumer service and support and 271 work in executive and administrative functions. 
We provide and maintain a work environment that is designed to attract, develop and retain top talent through offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to their career development. We recognize that our success is based on the collective talents and dedication of those we employ. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, and we utilize both internal human resource personnel and external recruiting firms to identify and attract talent. Through our history of technological innovation, we appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. Due to the nature of our activities, we tend to heavily invest in engineering capital, employing highly skilled and specialized engineers and technicians in the areas of electronics, RF design, software, cloud, mechanical, industrial design, manufacturing and quality disciplines. 
Our staff is located around the globe at different office and development locations. Our R&D locations are as follows:

Next to these specialized centers of excellence, we employ engineering, sales and marketing and support staff in many of our regional offices in the United States, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, Brazil, India, Japan, Korea and Mexico.
We continue to be committed to an inclusive culture that values equality, opportunity and respect. We have an active policy and Code of Conduct covering diversity, inclusion, anti-discrimination and corporate social responsibility across all our facilities, and we encourage our suppliers to do the same. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a proactive steering committee to monitor, support and ensure the safety and health of all of our staff around the globe.
Labor unions represent approximately 44.8% of our 3,839 employees at December 31, 2020. Some unionized workers, employed in Monterrey, Mexico, are represented under contract with the Sindicato Industrial de Trabajadores de Nuevo León adherido a la Federación Nacional de Sindicatos Independientes. Other unionized workers, employed in Manaus, Brazil, are represented under contract with the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Industrias Metalugicas, Mecanicas e de Materiais Eletricos de Manaus. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit. We believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
Seasonality
