Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to acquiring, developing and commercializing life-changing medicines for underserved patient populations suffering from devastating rare diseases and cancer. We have a differentiated portfolio of small molecule targeted oncology product candidates and are advancing two potentially registrational clinical trials in rare tumor types, as well as several other programs addressing highly prevalent, genetically defined cancers. Our strategic approach and operational excellence in clinical development have enabled us to rapidly advance our two lead product candidates into late-stage clinical trials while simultaneously entering into multiple shared-value partnerships with industry leaders to expand our portfolio. From this foundation, we are continuing to build a differentiated global biopharmaceutical company intensely focused on understanding patients and their diseases in order to develop transformative targeted medicines.
​
Our most advanced product candidate, nirogacestat, is an oral, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor, or GSI, initially in development for the treatment of desmoid tumors, a rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft tissue tumor for which there are currently no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We believe nirogacestat may address the significant limitations associated with existing treatment options and has the potential to become the first therapy approved by the FDA for both newly diagnosed and previously treated desmoid tumors. Since we licensed nirogacestat from Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, in August 2017, the FDA has granted us Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication, and the European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation to nirogacestat for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In May 2019, we announced the initiation of the DeFi trial, a potentially registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of nirogacestat for adult patients with desmoid tumors, and in July 2020, we announced full enrollment of the DeFi trial. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021. In addition to the ongoing DeFi trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group, or COG, in September 2020, to evaluate nirogacestat for the treatment of pediatric patients with desmoid tumors.
​
Our second product candidate is mirdametinib, an oral, small molecule MEK inhibitor initially in development for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas, or NF1-PN, a rare tumor of the peripheral nerve sheath that causes significant pain and disfigurement, and that most often manifests in children. We believe that mirdametinib has the potential to offer a best-in-class profile in order to enable the long-term treatment required for this patient population, as compared to other MEK inhibitors. As with nirogacestat, we licensed mirdametinib from Pfizer in August 2017; since then, the FDA has granted mirdametinib both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation for NF1-PN, and the European Commission has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1. In October 2019, we announced the initiation of the ReNeu trial, a potentially registrational Phase 2b clinical trial of mirdametinib for pediatric and adult patients with NF1-PN. In February 2021, we reported interim clinical data from the first 20 adult patients enrolled in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial. We expect to complete enrollment of the trial in the second half of 2021.
​
In addition to our late-stage programs in rare oncology indications, we have expanded our portfolio to develop targeted therapies for the treatment of highly prevalent hematologic malignancies and genetically defined metastatic solid tumors. To advance this strategy, we are taking a precision medicine approach in collaboration with industry leaders. In hematologic malignancies, we have announced collaborations with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, Pfizer, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., or Allogene, and Precision BioSciences, Inc., or Precision, to develop novel combination regimens of nirogacestat alongside our collaborators’ B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, directed therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In addition to our industry collaborations with leading BCMA therapy developers, we are working with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, or Fred Hutch, to further explore nirogacestat’s ability to potentiate BCMA-directed therapies as part of a sponsored research agreement. In genetically defined metastatic solid tumors, our current efforts center on the mitogen activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway. In collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd., or BeiGene, we are exploring the combination of mirdametinib with BeiGene’s lifirafenib in RAS mutated and other MAPK aberrant cancers. In addition, we are exploring the use of BGB-3245 in a 

4



distinct set of genetically defined BRAF mutated tumors via MapKure, LLC, or MapKure, an entity jointly owned by us and BeiGene.
​
Together, we believe that our portfolio provides multiple opportunities for value creation across three distinct categories of oncology programs, each of which has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients suffering from severe rare diseases and cancer. In our late-stage rare oncology programs, we believe that our two potentially registrational trials with nirogacestat and mirdametinib each have best-in-class potential for the patient populations in which they are being advanced. In our malignant hematology programs, we believe that nirogacestat has the potential to become a cornerstone of BCMA combination therapy in multiple myeloma and we are seeking to achieve this goal by working with partners developing BCMA-targeted agents across modalities. In our biomarker defined metastatic solid tumor programs, we believe that our precision medicine approach to cancers harboring mutations in key MAPK pathway genes, such as RAS and BRAF, provides the opportunity for meaningful clinical benefit for biomarker defined patient populations.
​
Furthermore, we intend to continue to expand our portfolio by licensing additional programs with strong biological rationales and validated mechanisms of action. We also plan to continue using shared-value partnerships to maximize the potential of our therapies to serve patients. Since our founding, we have invested in building leading clinical development capabilities and have focused on structuring innovative partnerships that seek to align incentives and optimize business outcomes for each party involved. We believe that this approach will continue to allow us to expand our shared-value relationships with innovators, maximize the potential of our existing and future portfolio, and ultimately support the building of a scalable and sustainable business focused on the efficient advancement and commercialization of product candidates that hold the potential to transform the lives of patients living with severe rare diseases and cancer.

For purposes of this report, when we refer herein to a “potentially registrational trial,” we are referring to a clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of a product candidate to potentially support submission of a marketing application for such product candidate with the applicable regulatory authorities. Such a trial is also sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial.

Nirogacestat is currently in the potentially registrational Phase 3 DeFi clinical trial for the treatment of adult patients with desmoid tumors, which are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft tissue tumors. Desmoid tumors can aggressively invade surrounding healthy tissues and cause significant morbidities, including severe pain, internal bleeding, incapacitating loss of range of motion and, in rare cases, death. There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors. Nirogacestat has been generally well tolerated in approximately 300 subjects and clinical activity was observed in the desmoid tumor patients enrolled in two previous clinical trials, many of whom had been heavily pre-treated. Since then, the FDA has granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of desmoid tumors. We are currently conducting the DeFi trial, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults with progressing desmoid tumors. We believe that we have designed the DeFi trial such that, if nirogacestat demonstrates clinical activity consistent with that observed in desmoid tumor patients treated to date with nirogacestat, the primary endpoint of this clinical trial should be met. If the results are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for nirogacestat in the U.S. and select international markets. In July 2020, we announced full enrollment of the DeFi trial, and we expect to report topline data in the second half of 2021. In addition to the ongoing DeFi trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in collaboration with COG in September 2020 to evaluate nirogacestat for the treatment of pediatric patients with desmoid tumors. 
​
Nirogacestat + BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) is being explored in collaboration with GSK in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, or RRMM. GSK’s BLENREP is the most clinically advanced BCMA antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, and is approved as a monotherapy in RRMM patients whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with at least four prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, proteasome inhibitor and anti-CD38 antibody. Based on data presented by GSK demonstrating synergy when combining BLENREP and nirogacestat in preclinical multiple myeloma models, we believe that the clinical activity of BLENREP may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Other than the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights, GSK is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the collaboration, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party. The nirogacestat combination with BLENREP is being evaluated as a cohort within GSK’s DREAMM-5 platform study, which is an adaptive Phase 1b clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients. We expect initial clinical data to be reported for the combination of nirogacestat and BLENREP in 2021. 
​
Nirogacestat + ALLO-715 is being explored in collaboration with Allogene in patients with RRMM. Allogene’s ALLO-715 is a clinical-stage allogeneic BCMA chimeric antigen receptor type T, or CAR T, cell therapy. We believe that the clinical activity of allogeneic BCMA CAR T cell therapies, including ALLO-715, may be enhanced with the addition of a GSI like nirogacestat, and encouraging clinical activity has been demonstrated when combining a GSI with other BCMA CAR T cell therapies. Other than the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights, Allogene is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the collaboration, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party. In December 2020, Allogene announced clearance from the FDA for its Investigational New Drug application, or IND to study ALLO-715 in combination with nirogacestat. As part of their ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for ALLO-715, Allogene initiated the cohort evaluating the combination in the first quarter of 2021.
​
Nirogacestat + teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is being explored in collaboration with Janssen in patients with RRMM. Janssen’s teclistamab is a clinical-stage bispecific antibody that targets BCMA and CD3 with monotherapy clinical activity having been demonstrated in RRMM patients. Based on data published by Janssen demonstrating that the activity of teclistamab was improved when combined with a GSI in preclinical multiple myeloma models, we believe that the clinical activity of teclistamab may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Other than the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights, Janssen is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the collaboration, which is governed by a joint oversight committee with equal representation from each party. A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the combination was initiated in the first quarter of 2021 by Janssen.
​
Nirogacestat + elranatamab (PF-06863135) is being explored in collaboration with Pfizer in patients with RRMM. Pfizer’s elranatamab is a clinical-stage bispecific antibody that targets BCMA and CD3 with monotherapy clinical activity having been demonstrated in RRMM patients. Based on data presented by Pfizer demonstrating that the activity of elranatamab was improved when combined with a GSI in preclinical multiple myeloma models, we believe that the clinical activity of elranatamab may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Other than the manufacturing of 

6



nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights, Pfizer is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the collaboration, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party. Pfizer is expected to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination in the first half of 2021.
​
Nirogacestat + PBCAR269A is being explored in collaboration with Precision in patients with RRMM. Precision’s PBCAR269A is a clinical-stage allogeneic BCMA CAR T cell therapy. Based on preclinical data with PBCAR269A, we believe that the clinical activity of PBCAR269A may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Other than the manufacturing of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights, Precision is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the collaboration, which is governed by a joint steering committee with equal representation from each party. Precision is expected to begin evaluating the combination in the first half of 2021 by expanding its ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial to include a nirogacestat combination arm.
​
Mirdametinib is currently in the potentially registrational Phase 2b ReNeu clinical trial for the treatment of NF1-PN, which is a rare tumor of peripheral nerve sheaths that causes significant pain and disfigurement, and that most often manifests in children. In a previous Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in NF1-PN patients, mirdametinib was observed to be clinically active and generally well tolerated. Since then, the FDA has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1 and Fast Track Designation for the treatment of NF1-PN, and the European Commission has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1. The Phase 2b ReNeu trial is an open-label, single-arm trial enrolling both pediatric and adult NF1-PN patients. Given the clinical activity and tolerability observed with mirdametinib in the previous NF1-PN clinical trial and informed by our discussions with the FDA, we designed our Phase 2b clinical trial in a manner that we believe has the potential to generate sufficient data to support approval in both pediatric and adult NF1-PN patients. In February 2021, we reported interim clinical data from the first 20 adult patients enrolled in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial. We expect to complete enrollment for the ReNeu trial in the second half of 2021. If, at the conclusion of the trial, the results are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets. 
​
Mirdametinib + lifirafenib is a combination therapy that we are evaluating in collaboration with BeiGene in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial that is currently enrolling patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors that harbor various oncogenic driver mutations in the MAPK pathway, a signaling pathway whose constitutive activation has been reported in approximately 25% of human cancers due to mutations in genes such as RAS and RAF. Lifirafenib is a pan-RAF dimer inhibitor that was observed to be clinically active in advanced solid tumor patients with RAS and RAF mutations. Preclinical synergy has been observed with mirdametinib and lifirafenib in RAS mutant or MAPK aberrant tumors and based on these data, we believe that lifirafenib’s monotherapy clinical activity can be enhanced with the addition of mirdametinib and that this combination may represent a promising therapy for cancers whose growth is reliant on MAPK pathway signaling, particularly those with mutations in RAS. In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway are currently being enrolled in Australia and in the U.S. We expect to report initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in 2021. 
​
BGB-3245 is an investigational oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of specific BRAF driver mutations and genetic fusions. BGB-3245 is being advanced via MapKure, an entity jointly owned by us and BeiGene. BGB-3245 is exclusively licensed to MapKure by BeiGene and is being initially developed as a monotherapy. Preclinical activity has been observed with BGB-3245 in a range of tumor models with BRAF mutations or BRAF fusions that are presently unaddressed with approved BRAF-directed therapies. MapKure initiated an adaptive Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion clinical trial evaluating BGB-3245 in genetically defined solid tumors in the first quarter of 2020 and patient enrollment is ongoing in Australia and in the U.S. We expect MapKure to report initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial in 2021. 
​
COVID-19 pandemic
​
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease associated with SARS-CoV2, as a global pandemic. Governments and businesses around the world have taken unprecedented actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, shelter- in-place orders, 

7



quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have undertaken a number of business continuity measures to mitigate potential disruption to our operations and in order to preserve the integrity of our research and development programs. To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions to the execution of the research and development activities that we currently have underway; however, as a result of the pandemic we may experience disruptions that could impact our research and development timelines and outcomes. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the impact of emerging variants, on our business. While the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future results will depend on future developments, it is possible that the global pandemic and its associated economic impacts could result in a material impact to our business, future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
​
Our strategy
Our goal is to continue building a differentiated, global biopharmaceutical company by acquiring, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for underserved patient populations. We aim to be an industry leader in rare diseases and targeted oncology. 
The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Efficiently advance our lead product candidates, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, towards marketing approval in the rare oncology indications in which they are currently being developed. We believe that our leading drug development capabilities will enable us to continue efficiently advancing our product candidates towards marketing approval, and we will make use of accelerated regulatory pathways when possible. Since our inception in August 2017, we have made rapid progress advancing two product candidates towards marketing approval. Our first product candidate, nirogacestat, was granted Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Nirogacestat is currently being evaluated in the potentially registrational DeFi trial; we expect to report topline data from the Phase 3 DeFi trial in the second half of 2021. Our second product candidate, mirdametinib, was granted Orphan Drug Designation by both the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of NF1 and Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of NF1-PN. Mirdametinib is currently being evaluated in the potentially registrational ReNeu trial; we expect to provide an update on this trial in the first quarter of 2021.

We have entered into strategic partnerships to develop innovative combination therapies that leverage emerging insights into the fundamental mechanisms that drive cancer. Our strategy is to align incentives among parties by sharing development costs and downstream economics for selected partnered programs. By pursuing this strategy, we believe that we can access promising therapies being developed across the biopharmaceutical industry for which there is scientific and clinical rationale for combinations with our existing product candidates. We have announced collaborations with Allogene, BeiGene, GSK, Janssen, Pfizer and Precision and we intend to execute additional strategic partnerships in the future.

● | Commercialize our product candidates, if approved, either alone or in partnership with others, to bring new medicines to underserved patient populations using a focused and efficient approach. We intend to market and commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the U.S. and select international markets, either alone or in partnership with others. We expect to build our medical affairs organization and commercial infrastructure using a focused and efficient approach, initially establishing market access, sales and marketing capabilities in a targeted manner that is appropriate for the relevant product opportunity. We believe that this approach will allow us to effectively reach the patients and physicians that our product candidates have been developed for and to maximize the commercial potential of our portfolio.

Our product candidates
Nirogacestat
Overview
Nirogacestat (PF-03084014), our most advanced product candidate, is an oral, selective GSI that we are developing for the treatment of certain oncology indications. Gamma secretase is a protease complex that cleaves numerous transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein, or APP, Notch, HER4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, BCMA and CD44. Cleavage of these transmembrane proteins by gamma secretase leads to a variety of signaling events that result from the untethering of the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins. Several of gamma secretase’s substrates have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including APP in Alzheimer’s disease and BCMA and Notch in cancer, forming the rationale for evaluating gamma secretase as a therapeutic target. We believe there is significant potential for nirogacestat to address both newly diagnosed and previously treated desmoid tumors and has the potential to be used more broadly in cancer, either alone or in combination with other therapies.
Desmoid tumors are rare, non-metastatic soft tissue tumors that can occur in both children and adults. Depending on tumor size and location, desmoid tumors can cause severe morbidities such as pain, disfigurement, internal bleeding and incapacitating loss of range of motion. We exclusively licensed worldwide rights to nirogacestat from Pfizer in August 2017. In June 2018, the FDA granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of desmoid tumors and in November 2018 the FDA granted nirogacestat Fast Track Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In August 2019, the FDA granted nirogacestat Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In addition, in September 2019, the European Commission granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
Nirogacestat has been evaluated in nine clinical trials, excluding our ongoing Phase 3 DeFi trial and the ongoing Phase 1b combination clinical trial with GSK, and approximately 300 subjects have been exposed to treatment. Nirogacestat’s clinical activity was observed in the two previous clinical trials that enrolled desmoid tumor patients, in which nirogacestat was generally well tolerated. Pfizer conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of nirogacestat as a treatment for various types of solid tumors. Five of the seven evaluable desmoid tumor patients enrolled in this clinical trial experienced a partial response, or PR, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0, or RECIST v1.0, yielding a 71% objective response rate, or ORR. In these seven desmoid tumor patients, median progression free survival, or PFS, had not been reached at the time of publication owing to the lack of patients progressing on therapy.
The National Cancer Institute, or NCI, then conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating nirogacestat as a treatment for desmoid tumors. Of the 17 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, 16 were evaluable for a response, five of whom had a confirmed PR and 11 of whom had stable disease, or SD, yielding a disease control rate of 100%. Furthermore, due to the lack of patients progressing on therapy, at the time of publication median PFS had not been reached.
Nirogacestat has been generally well tolerated in desmoid tumor patients as evidenced by the duration of time on therapy. In the Phase 1 clinical trial, the mean time on therapy was approximately four years. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, 

9



59% of patients remained on therapy for at least two years, and as of January 2021, five patients are continuing to receive nirogacestat, with treatment durations exceeding 5 years for each of these patients.
Based on these encouraging results, in May 2019, we announced the initiation of the DeFi trial, a potentially registrational Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, and in July 2020, we announced full enrollment of the trial. We believe that we have designed the DeFi trial such that if nirogacestat demonstrates clinical activity consistent with that observed in desmoid tumor patients treated to date with nirogacestat, the primary endpoint of this clinical trial, which is PFS, should be met. If the results are favorable, we plan to apply for marketing approval for nirogacestat in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.

In August 2020, we highlighted published data from investigators at the University of Minnesota and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute demonstrating clinical benefit in four pediatric and young adult desmoid tumor patients treated with nirogacestat under our Expanded Access Program. The clinical activity of nirogacestat in these four patients yielded one complete response, two partial responses and one stable disease, with no Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events reported. In September 2020, a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in collaboration with COG to evaluate nirogacestat for the treatment of children and adolescents with progressive, surgically unresectable desmoid tumors. We are encouraged by the data in these four pediatric and young adult patients and this Phase 2 clinical trial will enable us to further evaluate the potential benefit of nirogacestat in younger desmoid tumor patients. 
In addition to our development efforts in desmoid tumors, we are evaluating nirogacestat as a combination agent with BCMA-targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. GSIs have been shown to reduce cleavage of membrane-bound BCMA on multiple myeloma cells, thereby improving the activity of BCMA-targeted therapies. We are evaluating this novel combination therapy approach through clinical collaborations with several industry partners. We have entered into separate non-exclusive clinical collaborations with GSK, Allogene, Janssen, Precision and Pfizer, each of whom is developing one or more BCMA-targeted therapies. Each partner is responsible for the conduct and expenses of a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of nirogacestat with its respective BCMA agent in RRMM. In June 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in an adaptive Phase1b trial with GSK and we expect to initiate clinical trials with each of Allogene, Janssen, Precision and Pfizer in the first half of 2021.
Nirogacestat for treatment of desmoid tumors
Disease background
Desmoid tumors, also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type fibromatosis, are rare and often debilitating and disfiguring soft tissue tumors characterized by a growth pattern that can invade surrounding healthy tissues, including joints, muscle and viscera. The morbidity of a desmoid tumor is driven by the location of the tumor and the aggressiveness of its growth pattern. Mesentery desmoid tumors, arising in the abdominal cavity, can cause potentially life-threatening abdominal vasculature and bowel obstructions. Similarly, if a desmoid tumor occurs in the head and neck region, it can result in potentially life-threatening impingement on vital structures. When desmoid tumors occur near joints, even small lesions can result in debilitating loss of range of motion, impaired mobility and severe pain. While variable in size, in rare cases, desmoid tumors have been documented to grow in excess of 30 centimeters in diameter.
Patients with desmoid tumors can experience severe impacts on their quality of life. The French desmoid tumor patient advocacy group, SOS Desmoïde, published a national survey of its members in 2015 to assess pain burden in desmoid tumor patients; out of 102 respondents, 63% noted the presence of pain associated with their disease, 38% of whom characterized their pain as permanent. During the prospective development of patient-reported outcome tools for desmoid tumors, Memorial Sloan Kettering and Quintiles evaluated the impacts of desmoid tumors in 31 patients and found that 81% reported disfigurement, 68% reported range-of-motion impairment and 65% reported a negative impact on their activities of daily living as a result of their tumors.
Desmoid tumors typically occur in patients between the ages of 15 to 60 years and are more commonly diagnosed in the third and fourth decades of life, with a two-to-three times higher prevalence in females. The yearly incidence is 

10



estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 new desmoid tumor patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. Most cases of desmoid tumor occur spontaneously and are associated with one of several mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes for the β-catenin protein. There is also a subset of desmoid tumor patients whose tumors are attributable to germline mutations in the APC gene, which encodes for a protein involved in the degradation of β-catenin. These patients have a syndrome known as familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP, and the incidence of desmoid tumors is 800 to 1,000 times higher in FAP patients as compared to the general population. When APC or CTNNB1 mutations are present, tissue trauma, including surgery, pregnancy or soft tissue injury, can lead to the formation of desmoid tumors.
The clinical course of desmoid tumors varies across the patient population. Within any given patient, desmoid tumors can alternate between periods of rapid growth and stabilization, and spontaneous regressions have been reported in up to 20% of patients. Desmoid tumors can vary significantly in terms of their morphology and radiographic appearance but are generally routine to diagnose. Desmoid tumors are usually first noted upon physical examination or by using various imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Histologically, desmoid tumors appear with variable collagen deposition and are not clearly circumscribed. Definitive diagnosis relies upon immunohistochemical stains for nuclear localization of β-catenin. Diagnosis can also be confirmed by screening for mutations in the CTNNB1 and APC genes.
Desmoid tumors, despite being highly morbid, typically have a limited impact on mortality. Due to this limited impact on overall lifespan and current poor treatment options, we believe that there is a sizable prevalent pool of desmoid tumor patients. Existing treatments for desmoid tumors often have low success rates. Up to 70% of patients undergoing surgery will relapse depending on patient age, tumor location and tumor size. Furthermore, based on feedback we have received from interviews and surveys of over 200 physicians, each of whom has treated at least five desmoid tumor patients over the preceding five years, we believe that approximately 50% of patients receiving a given systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or a locoregional intervention such as surgery will not have a satisfactory treatment outcome and will require subsequent treatment for their desmoid tumors. Based on this market research, we believe that up to 90% or more of patients will eventually receive an active intervention, and we estimate that, in any given year over the next decade, approximately 5,500 to 7,000 desmoid tumor patients will be actively receiving treatment in the U.S.
Current treatment landscape for desmoid tumors
There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of desmoid tumors. Historically, desmoid tumors were treated with surgical resection, but this approach has become less favored due to an emerging body of evidence showing a post-surgical tumor recurrence rate of up to 70%, which can potentially increase disease burden and require additional intervention. In addition to the high recurrence rates, surgery itself carries risk of complications and can also be highly morbid, occasionally requiring limb amputation. Given the potential morbidities of surgery and the uncertain magnitude and durability of its benefit, physicians now typically adopt a watchful waiting approach for patients who historically may have been candidates for surgery. Despite its limitations, surgery is still used when a desmoid tumor presents significant risk of morbidity or mortality, such as tumors arising in the head and neck. Radiation therapy may also be used alone or in conjunction with surgery but is generally not preferred given the reported risk of developing secondary neoplasms.
In addition to these local treatments, systemic therapies have been used off-label with varying degrees of activity and tolerability. These therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, such as liposomal doxorubicin and vinblastine/methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-hormonal therapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, imatinib and pazopanib. Of these agents, only sorafenib has been studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with desmoid tumors; this Phase 3 clinical trial was investigator-initiated and did not have a biopharmaceutical industry sponsor. Although sorafenib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to placebo, tolerability was a substantial issue; 20% of treated patients discontinued due to adverse events and an additional 22% of treated patients withdrew consent. At a median follow-up time of 27 months, 61% of the patients receiving sorafenib had discontinued treatment. Overall, we believe that the available off-label systemic therapies are poorly suited for the treatment of desmoid tumors and have not demonstrated an acceptable balance of safety and activity in this population. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet medical need exists for the treatment of desmoid tumors.

Our solution—nirogacestat for the treatment of desmoid tumors
Nirogacestat is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of gamma secretase. We believe that nirogacestat can address the significant limitations associated with existing treatment options and has the potential to become the first therapy approved by the FDA for both newly diagnosed and previously treated desmoid tumors. In May 2019, we announced the initiation of our potentially registrational Phase 3 DeFi trial evaluating nirogacestat in adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors, and in July 2020, we announced full enrollment of the trial.
Mechanism of action
Nirogacestat is an oral, potent, selective, reversible, noncompetitive small molecule inhibitor of gamma secretase, an integral protease complex that cleaves numerous functionally important transmembrane proteins, including Notch. Gamma secretase’s cleavage of Notch causes the release of the Notch intracellular domain, or NICD, which shuttles into the nucleus and activates transcription of downstream target genes. Notch signaling is a regulator of cell proliferation and its dysregulation has been implicated in many forms of cancer. In desmoid tumor cell lines, nirogacestat has been observed to significantly decrease NICD release and reduce downstream activity of the Notch signaling pathway and decrease tumor cell migration, invasion and growth.
Clinical experience with nirogacestat
Approximately 300 subjects have been exposed to nirogacestat across nine clinical trials, not including ongoing clinical trials such as our Phase 3 DeFi trial in desmoid tumor patients and combination trials with BCMA-targeted therapies. Nirogacestat’s clinical activity was observed in two previous clinical trials that enrolled desmoid tumor patients. The first of these was a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial conducted by Pfizer in patients with solid tumors, a subset of whom had a diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Given the activity of nirogacestat in the desmoid tumor patients treated in this Phase 1 clinical trial, the NCI conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial in desmoid tumor patients, which evaluated nirogacestat at 150 mg twice daily, or BID, the same dose being used in our DeFi trial. Nirogacestat was initially intended to be developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, but early clinical trials evaluating its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution did not demonstrate adequate brain exposure to pursue this indication. Given Notch’s role in cancer, nirogacestat was subsequently investigated as a potential antitumor agent. We believe that the peripherally restricted exposure of nirogacestat, as well as the safety and tolerability profile it has demonstrated across clinical trials to date, positions it as a potentially best-in-class GSI for oncology indications.
Nirogacestat was also investigated in three Phase 1 clinical trials conducted in healthy adult subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses. Nirogacestat was further studied in clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers either as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Across all clinical trials completed to date, the dose range evaluated for nirogacestat was 1 mg once daily, or QD, to 330 mg BID.
Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial
In June 2009, Pfizer commenced a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with various solid tumors. This clinical trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, ascertain the recommended Phase 2 dose and evaluate the safety and tolerability of nirogacestat. Sixty-four patients with solid tumors received doses of nirogacestat and the MTD was determined to be 220 mg BID. The recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be 150 mg BID, given its comparable pharmacodynamic activity but more tolerable profile as compared to 220 mg BID.
Of the 64 solid tumor patients enrolled, 46 were evaluable for response, seven of whom had desmoid tumors. Of these desmoid tumor patients, five experienced a PR (defined as at least a 30% reduction in the target lesion as measured by RECIST v1.0), yielding a 71% ORR. In the evaluable desmoid tumor patients, median PFS had not been reached at the time of publication owing to the lack of patients progressing on therapy. Patients whose desmoid tumors arose from either germline mutations in APC or spontaneous mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial. Patients with both of these tumor mutational characteristics experienced an objective response. Of the 39 evaluable non-desmoid tumor patients in this clinical trial, whose diagnoses included colon, breast, thyroid, non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancer, only one 

12



patient experienced an objective response. The results of this clinical trial were reported in peer-reviewed medical journals in 2014 and 2018.
The following graph shows RECIST v1.0 responses for the seven evaluable desmoid tumor patients enrolled in this Phase 1 clinical trial:

The following chart depicts the treatment course for each of the seven evaluable desmoid tumor patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial. Each bar shows the duration of clinical benefit for all therapies received since the time of diagnosis. Arrows on the right indicate patients who were still free of a new intervention, either on nirogacestat treatment (solid) or off nirogacestat treatment (striped), at the time of publication. As shown in the table below the chart, several of these patients were refractory to a number of previous interventions. The mean treatment duration for these patients was greater than four years, suggesting favorable, long-term tolerability of nirogacestat.

​
The 64 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 clinical trial received nirogacestat doses ranging from 20 mg BID to 330 BID. The most common treatment-related adverse events (recorded in greater than 10% of patients) were diarrhea (55%), nausea (38%), fatigue (30%), hypophosphatemia (27%), vomiting (23%), rash (20%) and decreased appetite (17%). The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 through 3 and dose reductions due to treatment-related adverse events were infrequent. Treatment-related adverse events that led to temporary discontinuation or dose reduction included diarrhea, hypophosphatemia, rash, nausea, vomiting and fatigue, and most of these subsequently resolved. Seven patients (11%) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of these, four patients (6%) discontinued due to a treatment-related adverse event (one for Grade 4 anaphylactic shock, one for Grade 1 visual impairment, one for a Grade 3 drug hypersensitivity reaction and one for Grade 3 rash). The Grade 4 anaphylactic shock adverse event was considered by the trial investigator to be related to intravenous treatment with morphine for pain control, as this adverse event started 25 minutes after morphine administration. However, treatment-related causality could not be excluded because the patient had received their first dose of nirogacestat before intravenous administration of morphine.
Long-term follow-up of the seven evaluable desmoid tumor patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial confirmed that all five patients who achieved a PR continued to maintain their responses between 48 and 73+ months. As of December 2016, four patients (patients 3, 4, 6 and 7) had stopped receiving nirogacestat but continued to be followed and remain free of progression between 11 and 53+ months after cessation of therapy. In all, the mean duration of clinical benefit observed was greater than 63 months. In addition, two patients continued to receive nirogacestat under a compassionate access protocol beyond the 2017 publication date, and through December 2020, one of these patients remained on treatment, having received nirogacestat for over eleven years. We believe the duration of clinical benefit and the tolerability profile observed in this Phase 1 clinical trial supported the rationale for the NCI’s subsequent clinical investigation of nirogacestat in desmoid tumor patients.
Phase 2 clinical trial 
The NCI commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in desmoid tumor patients in November 2014. This clinical trial enrolled 17 desmoid tumor patients, who received nirogacestat every day in three-week cycles at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 

14



150 mg BID. Patients were enrolled irrespective of their underlying mutation, which included germline and spontaneous APC mutations, as well as spontaneous CTNNB1 mutations (T41A and S45F). These patients were heavily pre-treated, having failed a median of four prior treatments (with a range of one to nine), which included various systemic therapies and local interventions, including surgery.
Sixteen patients were evaluable for a response using RECIST v1.1. Five patients had a confirmed PR and eleven patients had SD, yielding a disease control rate of 100% among the evaluable patients. Four of the five patients with a confirmed PR on nirogacestat had previously been treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including sorafenib and imatinib, without a reported response. Median PFS had not been reached at the time of publication owing to the lack of patients progressing on therapy. Clinical benefit was observed independent of underlying mutation, number of previous treatments and type of previous treatments. As of January 2021, five patients are continuing to receive nirogacestat, with treatment durations exceeding 5 years for each of these patients.
Best responses in the Phase 2 clinical trial, as measured by RECIST v1.1, are shown in the following chart. Dotted lines represent cutoffs for PR (defined as a 30% reduction from baseline) and for progressive disease (defined as a 20% increase from baseline). SD is reflected between the dotted lines. Patient #01 was missing a baseline CT measurement and therefore MRI was used. Patient #14 was not evaluable for response per protocol due to not returning to the clinical trial site for the patient’s first restaging evaluation and subsequently being lost to follow-up.

The following chart depicts treatment duration, clinical response and mutational status of desmoid tumor patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Time of PR is denoted using black arrows, and the ten patients continuing on therapy at the time of publication are denoted using gray arrows.

All patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial experienced at least one Grade 1 or Grade 2 adverse event. The most commonly reported adverse events regardless of grade and occurring in at least 30% of patients included diarrhea (76%), hypophosphatemia (76%), maculopapular rash (71%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (59%), nausea (53%), lymphocyte count decrease (53%), dry mouth (41%), alanine aminotransferase increase (35%) and anemia (35%). With the exception of hypophosphatemia, these adverse events were all reported as Grade 1 or Grade 2. The only Grade 3 adverse event occurring in at least 20% of patients was hypophosphatemia (47%), which is a known class effect of GSIs and was reversible with oral phosphate replacement therapy in the trial. Four patients required a dose reduction and one patient discontinued therapy due to Grade 2 urticaria that was not responsive to dose reduction. There were no Grade 4 adverse events reported.
DeFi trial and regulatory pathway for nirogacestat in desmoid tumors
Based upon the degree of clinical benefit for desmoid tumor patients observed in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, as well as our discussions with the FDA, in May 2019, we announced the initiation of our potentially registrational DeFi trial. The DeFi trial is being conducted under our open Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for nirogacestat. As of July 2020, the trial was fully enrolled.
The DeFi trial is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial being conducted at clinical sites in North America and Europe. The DeFi trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nirogacestat compared to placebo in patients with progressing desmoid tumors. This clinical trial will consist of two phases: a double-blind phase and an optional open-label extension, or OLE, phase. This clinical trial is enrolling desmoid tumor patients whose tumors have grown by at least 20% in the last 12 months as measured by RECIST v1.1 and will include both treatment-naïve and relapsed and refractory patients. Given the treatment effect observed in previous clinical trials, patients are eligible for enrollment irrespective of the number and type of previous treatments or the specific underlying mutations in APC or CTNNB1.
Patients are being randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 150 mg BID of nirogacestat or placebo every day for 28 day cycles. Eligible patients with confirmed disease progression on trial may enter the optional OLE phase to receive 150 mg BID of nirogacestat. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 115 patients. The primary PFS endpoint is defined as the time from randomization until the date of assessment of progression as determined using RECIST v1.1, or death by any cause. The documented date of radiographic progression will be determined by blinded independent central 

16



review. The FDA has stated that a PFS primary endpoint may support registration in an adequately designed trial with sufficient follow-up. We initiated the DeFi trial in May 2019, achieved complete enrollment in July 2020 and we expect topline data to be available in the second half of 2021; however, as the DeFi trial is an event-driven trial that is designed to measure the difference in PFS between patients receiving nirogacestat versus those receiving a placebo, the exact timing of the trial’s topline readout could fluctuate based upon the enrollment dynamics, the rate at which tumor progression events are occurring and site data entry and verification. 
​
The design of the DeFi trial is summarized in the schematic below:

Key secondary endpoints of the DeFi trial include safety and tolerability, ORR, duration of response and change in tumor volume. Patient-reported outcomes will also be key secondary endpoints in the DeFi trial and will be evaluated using several outcome instruments, including the Memorial Sloan Kettering/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Desmoid Tumor Impact and Desmoid Tumor Symptom scales, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function scale, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 and the Brief Pain Inventory. These instruments were selected to measure symptoms, impact of symptoms on daily living and outcomes that are most relevant to desmoid tumor patients.
In June 2018, the FDA granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of desmoid tumors and in November 2018, the FDA granted nirogacestat Fast Track Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In addition, in August 2019, the FDA granted nirogacestat Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable, recurrent or refractory desmoid tumors or deep fibromatosis. In addition, in September 2019, the European Commission granted nirogacestat Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. If the results from the DeFi trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for nirogacestat in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.
Nirogacestat in combination with BCMA-targeted agents
BCMA is a cell surface protein universally expressed on multiple myeloma, or MM, cells, and the clinical activity of monotherapy BCMA-targeted agents have been demonstrated in this indication. GSIs have been shown to increase BCMA expression on MM cells. Activity of this combination mechanism had previously been observed in multiple preclinical models of MM using BCMA-directed therapies in combination with GSIs, and in December 2019, our collaborator GSK presented preclinical data at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting demonstrating the ability of nirogacestat to potentiate the efficacy of their BCMA-targeted ADC belantamab mafodotin (now approved by the FDA BLENREP) up to 3,000-fold in a panel of BCMA-expressing human cancer cell lines. We believe this combination, as compared to BCMA-directed therapies alone, may provide a meaningful clinical benefit to MM patients by improving response rates, prolonging the duration of clinical benefit or reducing the side effect profile by enabling administration at a lower dose.
In June 2019, we entered into a clinical collaboration with GSK to explore the combination of nirogacestat with their BCMA-targeted ADC, BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf), in patients with RRMM. BLENREP is the most clinically advanced BCMA-targeted ADC and is approved as a monotherapy in RRMM patients whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with at least four prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, proteasome inhibitor and anti-CD38 antibody. We believe that the clinical activity of BCMA directed therapies, including belantamab mafodotin, may be enhanced with the addition of a GSI, like nirogacestat. In June 2020, we announced the dosing of the first patient in an adaptive Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the combination. GSK is responsible for the 

17



conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party. We expect initial clinical data on the combination of nirogacestat plus BLENREP to be reported in 2021.
In January 2020, we entered our second collaboration evaluating nirogacestat with a BCMA-targeted agent, in this case with ALLO-715, an allogeneic BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy product candidate being advanced by Allogene. In December 2020, Allogene announced clearance from the FDA for its IND to study ALLO-715 in combination with nirogacestat. As part of their ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for ALLO-715, Allogene initiated the cohort evaluating the combination in the first quarter of 2021. Allogene is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party.
In September 2020, we entered our third collaboration evaluating nirogacestat with a BCMA-targeted agent, in this case with teclistamab, a clinical-stage bispecific antibody that targets BCMA and CD3 being advanced by Janssen. Teclistamab has demonstrated monotherapy clinical activity in RRMM patients. Based on data published by Janssen demonstrating that the activity of teclistamab was improved when combined with a GSI in preclinical multiple myeloma models, we believe that the clinical activity of teclistamab may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Janssen initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the combination in the first quarter of 2021. Janssen is responsible for the conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint oversight committee with equal representation from each party.
In September 2020, we also entered our fourth collaboration evaluating nirogacestat with a BCMA-targeted agent, in this case with PBCAR269A, an allogeneic BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy being advanced by Precision. Precision is expected to begin evaluating the combination in the first half of 2021 by expanding its ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial to include a nirogacestat combination arm. Precision will be responsible for the conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint steering committee with equal representation from each party.
In October 2020, we entered our fifth collaboration evaluating nirogacestat with a BCMA-targeted agent, in this case with elranatamab, a clinical-stage bispecific antibody that targets BCMA and CD3 being advanced by Pfizer. Elranatamab has demonstrated monotherapy clinical activity demonstrated in RRMM patients. Based on data presented by Pfizer demonstrating that the activity of elranatamab was improved when combined with a GSI in preclinical multiple myeloma models, we believe that the clinical activity of elranatamab may be enhanced with the addition of nirogacestat. Pfizer is expected to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination in the first half of 2021. Pfizer will be responsible for the conduct and expenses of the trial, which is governed by a joint development committee with equal representation from each party.
In addition to our clinical collaborations, in September 2020, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with Fred Hutch to further explore the ability of nirogacestat to modulate BCMA and potentiate BCMA-targeting therapies in a variety of preclinical and patient-derived multiple myeloma models developed by researchers at Fred Hutch.
Disease background – multiple myeloma
MM is a plasma cell neoplasm with substantial morbidity and mortality and is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the U.S. accounting for approximately 10% of all hematologic cancers. The NCI surveillance, epidemiology and end results program estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 130,000 patients in the U.S. living with MM. Of these, approximately 27,000 have relapsed or are refractory to currently available therapies, representing a patient population with few therapeutic options and therefore a significant unmet medical need. It was estimated that approximately 13,000 individuals in the U.S. died from MM in 2020.
MM is characterized by the expansion and abnormal accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, which disrupts normal bone marrow function and over time can lead to anemia, hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, fatigue and weight loss. As the disease progresses, it destroys the surrounding bone marrow and can lead to renal failure, increased susceptibility to infection, skeletal deterioration and neurologic disease.

Current treatment landscape for MM
Treatment of MM has advanced significantly in the past decade driven by a deeper understanding of disease processes and a sequenced or polypharmacy approach. Newly diagnosed patients with MM are treated with either with stem cell transplants or with multiple classes of therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination, to attempt to control their disease progression. These agents include proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide, monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab, histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat, alkylating agents such as melphalan, anti-inflammatories such as dexamethasone and chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. Despite these current options, the durability of clinical response and benefit is often brief. As there are no therapies that currently are considered curative, nearly all patients who survive initial treatments are eventually deemed resistant or refractory to available therapies and their disease continues to progress. By the time these heavily pretreated patients reach this advanced state, they are often directed to clinical trials for treatment with experimental agents. Due to the advanced condition of these patients, the refractory nature of their disease and the toll prior treatments have taken on their health, responses to treatment are generally poor.
BCMA-directed agents have emerged as a potentially promising approach for the treatment of RRMM patients due to the restriction of BCMA’s expression solely on the surface of plasmablasts and differentiated plasma cells. The first of these agents to receive regulatory approval was GSK’s BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf), a BCMA-targeted ADC which was approved by the FDA in August 2020 as a monotherapy treatment for adults with RRMM who have received at least four prior therapies. We are aware of at least 20 distinct programs in preclinical and clinical development that target BCMA; these programs represent a variety of therapeutics modalities, including ADCs, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, or CAR-T cells, and allogeneic CAR-T cells.
We are also aware of at least two efforts by others to combine a GSI and a BCMA-directed agent to treat RRMM. Juno Therapeutics, Inc., a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, is currently evaluating an autologous BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy in combination with crenigacestat, a GSI licensed from Eli Lilly and Company in December 2017; this combination is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical testing. In December 2018, Novartis licensed the rights to another GSI, AL102, for use in combination with its autologous BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy; to our knowledge, this combination has not yet entered clinical testing. Both crenigacestat and AL102 have been evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials and a challenging tolerability profile was observed for both of these agents.
Our solution – combination of nirogacestat and antibody-drug conjugate
BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) was awarded Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in 2017 and is the first BCMA-targeted agent to receive regulatory approval from the FDA. The regulatory submission was based on the DREAMM-2 trial, an open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and activity of BLENREP in RRMM. In the DREAMM-2 trial, treatment of RRMM patients with BLENREP led to an objective response rate of 31% in 97 patients receiving the 2.5 mg/kg dose administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. Seventy-three percent of responders had a duration of response ≥ 6 months and the median duration of response was not reached.
Among these patients, 22% were exposed for 6 months or longer. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients who received BLENREP; keratopathy (2.1%) was the most frequent adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients who received BLENREP. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included pneumonia (7%), pyrexia (6%), renal impairment (4.2%), sepsis (4.2%), hypercalcemia (4.2%), and infusion-related reactions (3.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including sepsis (1%), cardiac arrest (1%), and lung infection (1%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 54% of patients who received BLENREP. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption in >3% of patients included keratopathy (47%), blurred vision (5%), dry eye (3.2%), and pneumonia (3.2%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in >3% of patients included keratopathy (23%) and thrombocytopenia (5%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were keratopathy, decreased visual acuity, nausea, blurred vision, pyrexia, infusion-related reactions, and fatigue.

19



We believe that the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of the combination of nirogacestat and BLENREP, which was initiated pursuant to our collaboration agreement with GSK, is the first clinical trial testing the combination of a GSI with a BCMA-targeted ADC for patients with RRMM. We believe that nirogacestat, by maintaining a high level of surface expression of BCMA on MM cells and by reducing peripheral antigen sink resulting from shed soluble BCMA extracellular domain, or ECD, can improve clinical outcomes over belantamab mafodotin alone. In particular, as compared to BLENREP alone, we believe this combination may improve response rates, prolong the duration of clinical benefit or reduce the side effect profile by enabling administration of BLENREP at a lower dose.
Our solution – combination of nirogacestat and allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies
ALLO-715 is a BCMA-targeted allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy product candidate in clinical testing for the treatment of RRMM and is delivered to patients via one-time infusion. The ALLO-715 Phase 1 monotherapy trial is currently ongoing and following the FDA clearance in December 2020 of an IND submitted by Allogene to study ALLO-715 in combination with nirogacestat, Allogene initiated a new combination cohort as part of their ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2021.
PBCAR269A is a BCMA-targeted allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy product candidate in clinical testing for the treatment of RRMM and is delivered to patients via one-time infusion. Precision is expected to begin evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and PBCAR269A in the first half of 2021 by expanding its ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial studying PBCAR269A to include a nirogacestat combination arm, pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Precision.
We believe that the ongoing and planned combination clinical trials of nirogacestat with ALLO-715 and PBCAR269A will be the first clinical trials testing the combination of a GSI with an allogeneic BCMA CAR-T cell therapy product candidate. Autologous BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy products have been associated with high response rates in clinical trials. We believe that nirogacestat, by maintaining a high level of surface expression of BCMA on MM cells and by reducing peripheral antigen sink resulting from shed soluble BCMA ECD may improve clinical outcomes over monotherapy CAR-T cell therapy. In particular, we believe this combination may improve response rates, prolong the duration of clinical benefit or reduce the side effect profile by enabling administration of a lower dose of CAR-T cells.
Our solution – combination of nirogacestat and bispecific antibodies
Teclistamab is a bispecific antibody targeting BCMA and CD3 in clinical testing for the treatment of RRMM. The teclistamab Phase 2 monotherapy trial is ongoing and pending discussions with regulators, we expect Janssen to initiate the Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the combination of nirogacestat and teclistamab in early 2021, pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Janssen.
Elranatamab is a bispecific antibody targeting BCMA and CD3 in clinical testing for the treatment of RRMM. A Phase 1 trial evaluating elranatamab as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide or a PD-1 inhibitor is ongoing. Pending discussions with regulators, we expect Pfizer to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the combination of nirogacestat and elranatamab in the first half of 2021, pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Pfizer. We believe that the planned combination clinical trials of nirogacestat with teclistamab and elranatamab will be the first clinical trials testing the combination of a GSI and a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody. We believe that nirogacestat, by maintaining a high level of surface expression of BCMA on MM cells and by reducing peripheral antigen sink resulting from shed soluble BCMA ECD may improve clinical outcomes over monotherapy bispecific antibody treatment. In particular, we believe this combination strategy may improve response rates, prolong the duration of clinical benefit or reduce the side effect profile by enabling administration at a lower dose.
Our differentiation – combination of nirogacestat and BCMA-targeted therapies
We believe that BCMA-targeted therapies will play an important role in the future treatment paradigm of MM, with each of our collaboration partners possessing particular advantages among the modalities being investigated to therapeutically target BCMA. ADCs and bispecific antibodies possess several attractive features, including conventional infusion schedules and standard pharmaceutical manufacturing, storage and administration processes. In addition, dosing of ADCs and bispecific antibodies can be readily modified throughout the course of treatment. Allogeneic CAR-T cell

therapies have the benefit of potentially yielding profound clinical benefit using a one-time infusion of an ‘off-the-shelf’ cell therapy product. Physician and patient preference for a given BCMA-targeted therapy modality may depend upon the treatment setting in which a patient is receiving care, the clinical characteristics of a given patient and the efficacy and tolerability profile of the therapy.
Given our clinical experience with nirogacestat as well as its tolerability profile at doses we believe will be active in combination with BCMA-targeted therapies based upon preclinical MM models, we believe that nirogacestat could be a compelling and differentiated GSI for use in combination with a BCMA-directed therapy in MM.
Combination mechanism of action
Gamma secretase has been shown to directly cleave membrane-bound BCMA, resulting in the release of the BCMA ECD from the cell surface. By inhibiting gamma secretase, membrane-bound BCMA can be preserved, increasing target density while reducing levels of soluble BCMA ECD, which may serve as decoy receptors. Nirogacestat’s ability to enhance the activity of BCMA-directed therapies has been observed in multiple preclinical models of MM, which was first presented in December 2019 at the 61st Annual American Society of Hematology meeting by our collaborator GSK in combination with belantamab mafodotin.
BLENREP’s activity against BCMA-expressing MM cells is attributable to four potential mechanisms: (1) targeted delivery of its cytotoxic payload, (2) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, (3) BCMA receptor signaling inhibition due to blocking of ligand binding and (4) immunogenic cell death. BLENREP is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting BCMA, which is conjugated to a monomethyl auristatin F, or MMAF, payload. Auristatin based cytotoxics have been employed in a variety of investigational ADCs, as well as in the approved agent brentuximab vedotin, a CD30 targeting molecule indicated in several hematologic malignancies.
The activity of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies, such as ALLO-715 and PBCAR269A, against BCMA-expressing MM cells is driven by direct T-cell mediated killing of BCMA expressing MM cells. 
The activity of BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibodies, such as teclistamab and elranatamab, is driven by the recruitment and activation of T cells to kill BCMA-expressing MM cells.

The following graphic illustrates the effect of GSI (shown in combination with a BCMA directed ADC) on decreasing gamma secretase-mediated cleavage of BCMA, leading to increased density of target (BCMA) on cancer cells and reduced levels of decoy receptors (soluble BCMA ECD).

The data demonstrated that treatment of BCMA-expressing cancer cell lines with nirogacestat led to significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and corresponding decreases in shedding of BCMA, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. We believe each of these mechanisms is important for potentiating the activity of BCMA-directed therapies. 


22



A 3-day proliferation assay on a panel of multiple myeloma and lymphoma cell lines with varying levels of BCMA expression was conducted. Results showed that adding nirogacestat enhanced multiple myeloma cell killing activity of belantamab mafodotin up to 3,000-fold and enabled sensitivity in belantamab mafodotin resistant cell lines outside of multiple myeloma.

Therefore, we believe that by increasing surface expression of BCMA and reducing the shedding of soluble BCMA, nirogacestat may enhance the ability of BCMA therapies to target disease-causing MM cells and improve clinical activity or tolerability in patients.
Planned combination therapies future clinical trials
In addition to the ongoing adaptive Phase 1b trial evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and BLENREP in patients with RRMM that is being conducted by GSK, the ongoing Phase 1 trial evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and ALLO-715 in patients with RRMM that is being conducted by Allogene and the ongoing Phase 1 trial evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and teclistamab in patients with RRMM that is being conducted by Janssen, we expect two additional clinical trials for nirogacestat in combination with each of our collaborators’ BCMA-targeted therapies to initiate in the first half of 2021.
We and Pfizer have designed a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of nirogacestat and elranatamab in patients with RRMM. Pending discussions with regulators, we expect Pfizer to initiate this Phase 1b/2 combination clinical trial in the first half of 2021.
Precision is expected to begin evaluating the combination of nirogacestat and PBCAR269A in the first half of 2021 by expanding its ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial to include a nirogacestat combination arm.
Mirdametinib
Overview
Mirdametinib (PD-0325901) is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2. MEK proteins occupy a pivotal position in the MAPK pathway, a key signaling network that regulates cell growth and survival, and that plays a central role in multiple oncology and rare disease indications.
We are initially investigating mirdametinib as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with NF1-PN, a rare disorder characterized by mutations in the MAPK pathway that lead to the growth of peripheral nerve sheath tumors, which cause significant pain, disfigurement and morbidity. NF1-PN are most often diagnosed in the first two decades of life and are characterized by aggressive tumor growth, which is typically more rapid during childhood. In August 2017, we licensed exclusive worldwide rights to mirdametinib from Pfizer. In October 2018 and July 2019, the FDA and European 

23



Commission, respectively, granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1, and in May 2019, the FDA granted mirdametinib Fast Track Designation for the treatment of NF1-PN.
Mirdametinib has been evaluated in eight Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, with over 200 subjects having been exposed to treatment. A Phase 2 clinical trial was conducted by the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Consortium, which evaluated mirdametinib in 19 NF1-PN patients. In this clinical trial, 42% of patients experienced an objective response (defined as at least a 20% volumetric reduction in their target PN tumor) by 12 months of treatment. Based on the strength of these data and our interactions with the FDA, we initiated our potentially registrational single-arm, open-label Phase 2b ReNeu clinical trial of mirdametinib in NF1-PN patients in October 2019. The primary endpoint for the ReNeu trial is ORR, with an objective response defined as at least a 20% reduction in tumor volume from baseline as determined by volumetric MRI assessment. If the results of this clinical trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.
In addition to our monotherapy program in NF1-PN, we believe that mirdametinib holds promise for use in multiple targeted combination therapies in oncology. Our first such effort is evaluating mirdametinib in combination with BeiGene’s RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib (BGB-283). In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of this combination that is being conducted by BeiGene. This trial is currently enrolling patients in the U.S. and Australia with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway.
Overview of the MAPK pathway
The MAPK pathway, which relies upon the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, represents a central biological pathway in all human cells that is responsible for helping to regulate cellular transcription, proliferation and survival. The general structure of the pathway consists of RAS, a small GTPase, and three downstream protein kinases, RAF, MEK and ERK. In addition, at the level of RAS, the pathway is negatively regulated by several proteins, including neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene. Given its direct regulation of ERK, which directly controls downstream signaling through the MAPK pathway, MEK occupies a pivotal position in this signaling cascade and represents a rational therapeutic target for addressing indications where overactivation of the MAPK pathway contributes significantly to disease onset and/or progression.

24



Constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway has been reported in approximately 25% of human cancers, including colon, lung, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and renal tumors. The cause of pathway activation is varied and tissue-specific, but is driven by one or more of the following mechanisms, each of which is depicted in the illustration below: (i) upstream activation of one or more receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, (ii) mutations in a RAS isoform, such as KRAS and (iii) other mutations or aberrations within the pathway, such as in BRAF and NF1.

Mirdametinib for treatment of NF1-PN
Disease background
NF1 is a rare, autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder that arises from mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes for neurofibromin, a key negative regulator of the MAPK pathway. NF1 is the most common form of neurofibromatosis, with an estimated global birth incidence of approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 patients living with NF1 in the U.S. NF1 is clinically heterogeneous and manifests in a variety of symptoms across numerous organ systems, including abnormal pigmentation, skeletal deformities, tumor growth and neurological complications, such as cognitive impairment. Patients with NF1 have a 15-year mean reduction in their life expectancy compared to the general population.
NF1 patients have an approximately 30% to 50% lifetime risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas, or PN, which are tumors that grow in an infiltrative pattern along the peripheral nerve sheath and that can cause severe disfigurement, pain 

25



and functional impairment; in rare cases, NF1-PN may be fatal. NF1-PN are most often diagnosed in the first two decades of life and can be confirmed using routine imaging techniques. These tumors are characterized by aggressive growth, which is typically more rapid during childhood. NF1-PN typically do not spontaneously regress. In a study published in 2012 examining the natural growth dynamics of NF1-PN, 95 NF1-PN patients had the volumes of individual PN lesions monitored over time. Of these 95 patients, 69 were older than 16 years of age at the time of the initial assessment; these 69 patients had a total of 146 NF1-PN lesions monitored. At an average follow-up time of 2.4 years (range 1.05 to 4.10 years), six lesions (4.1%) were documented to have had a volumetric decrease of at least 20%.
While NF1-PN are benign, these tumors can undergo malignant transformation, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, or MPNST. NF1 patients have an 8% to 15% lifetime risk of developing MPNST, a diagnosis that carries with it a 12-month survival rate of under 50%. In addition to MPNST, NF1 patients are at an increased risk of developing other malignancies, including breast cancer and gliomas.
Current treatment landscape for NF1-PN
A MEK inhibitor, Koselugo (selumetinib), was approved by the FDA in April 2020 for the treatment of pediatric patients two years of age and older with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN. While surgical resection is another treatment option for NF1-PN patients, wide margins are required to resect the tumors, and this is an outcome that can rarely be achieved in NF1-PN patients. This is because NF1-PN arise from nerve cells and grow in an infiltrative pattern, making it challenging to successfully resect tumors without severe comorbidities, such as permanent nerve damage and disfigurement. Patients that are ineligible for surgery or those who have had a recurrence post-surgery are often treated with a variety of off-label therapies. Among these off-label therapies are various systemic treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which have not been shown to consistently confer a clinical benefit.
The inadequacy of surgery highlights the need for improved systemic therapies. Given that NF1-PN is driven by overactivation of the MAPK pathway, MEK inhibitors have emerged as a class of therapies that hold significant promise for the treatment of NF1-PN, and we believe that MEK inhibitors have the potential to become the standard of care.
In addition to Koselugo, we are aware of at least two other MEK inhibitors in Phase 2 clinical trials for this indication, including a MEK inhibitor approved for other oncology indications that is sometimes used off-label in NF1-PN patients. Given the lifelong and devastating nature of NF1-PN, as well as the need to begin treating patients at a young age, we believe that the optimal MEK inhibitor is one that will have a tolerability profile suitable for long-term dosing while simultaneously arresting or reversing tumor growth.
Our solution — mirdametinib for the treatment of NF1-PN
Mirdametinib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, which we are developing as a monotherapy in NF1-PN. Based on results from prior clinical trials, we believe that mirdametinib, using the dose and schedule from the NF1-PN Phase 2 clinical trial, has the potential to offer a potentially best-in-class profile in order to enable the long-term treatment required for this patient population, as compared to other MEK inhibitors. Given the clinical activity and tolerability profile observed with mirdametinib in the previous NF1-PN clinical trial, and following our discussions with the FDA, we designed our ongoing potentially registrational Phase 2b clinical trial, or the ReNeu trial, in a manner that we believe has the potential to generate sufficient data to support approval in both pediatric and adult NF1-PN patients. If the results of the ReNeu trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets, although specific countries have not yet been finally determined.
Mechanism of action
Neurofibromin is a critical repressor of RAS signaling and is impaired in patients with a mutated NF1 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. MEK inhibitors can reduce MAPK pathway activity and therefore arrest or reverse NF1-PN growth, which has been observed clinically with several MEK inhibitors, including mirdametinib.

26



Clinical experience with mirdametinib
Over 200 subjects have been exposed to mirdametinib across eight clinical trials, not including our ongoing ReNeu trial in NF1-PN patients and the ongoing Phase 1b/2 combination clinical trial with BeiGene. Mirdametinib has shown clinical activity in a previous Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trial Consortium that enrolled adolescent and adult NF1-PN patients, and data from this clinical trial was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2021. Given the activity and tolerability of mirdametinib in this clinical trial, we are utilizing the same dose and schedule in our potentially registrational Phase 2b ReNeu trial. Furthermore, based on discussions with the FDA, we will be enrolling pediatric NF1-PN patients, in addition to adolescent and adult patients.
Mirdametinib has been tested in monotherapy clinical trials across a broad dose range (from 1 mg QD to 30 mg BID), with the initial MTD determined to be 15 mg BID and the recommended Phase 2 dose determined to be 10 mg BID administered on a five days-on, two days-off schedule.
Post-treatment biopsies taken in a Phase 1 monotherapy clinical trial in solid tumors showed a pharmacodynamic effect at doses as low as 1 mg QD, as measured by a greater than 90% decrease in levels of phosphorylated ERK from baseline, demonstrating inhibition of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, in the Phase 2 clinical trial in NF1-PN patients, clinical activity was observed at doses of 4 mg BID and below. These pharmacodynamic and clinical activity data at doses below the MTD formed the rationale for continuing to advance mirdametinib in NF1-PN and in genetically defined solid tumors, either alone or in combination.
To date, the safety profile of monotherapy mirdametinib in patients with advanced cancers at doses lower than 10 mg BID using an intermittent schedule has been characterized by mostly manageable and reversible toxicities, and mirdametinib is observed to be generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported of these adverse events have been rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue.
Other adverse events have been reported at a lower frequency, though these adverse events primarily occurred in patients who received doses above 10 mg and up to 30 mg BID, a range that is significantly higher than the maximum allowable dose of 4 mg BID being used in our ongoing Phase 2b ReNeu trial. These adverse events included ocular disorders (visual disturbances, blurred vision and retinal vein occlusion), nervous system disorders (confusion, slowed ideation, slurred speech and hallucinations), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (general weakness and neck muscle weakness associated with mild and moderate elevations in creatine kinase) and cardiac disorders (decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and congestive heart failure). 
Phase 2 clinical trial in NF1-PN 
The Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating mirdametinib in adolescents and adults with NF1-PN enrolled 19 patients between 16 and 39 years of age. This clinical trial commenced in June 2014 and data was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2021. Patients received an oral dose of 2 mg/m2 BID with a maximum dose of 4 mg BID (without regard to food) on a four-week cycle of three weeks-on, one week-off. Eight patients (42%) achieved an objective response by cycle 12, prospectively defined as a volumetric reduction in their target PN of at least 20%, and 10 patients (53%) had stable disease. The following chart shows maximum tumor volume change from baseline for each patient.

27



The protocol specified that patients were to be removed from the clinical trial if they did not achieve at least a 15% volumetric reduction in their target PN by cycle eight of treatment, corresponding to approximately eight months on therapy. Patients achieving at least a 15% reduction in their target PN by cycle eight of treatment, but who did not achieve at least a 20% reduction in their target PN by cycle 12 of treatment, were also removed from the trial. Importantly, it has been observed in subsequent clinical trials of other MEK inhibitors that some NF1-PN patients achieved their first objective response to therapy 12 months or more following the start of treatment. Therefore, we believe that the design of this clinical trial was not optimized to demonstrate the full potential of mirdametinib’s antitumor activity in the NF1-PN patients that were enrolled, a consideration that we have aimed to address in our ongoing potentially registrational Phase 2b ReNeu trial by allowing patients to remain on treatment for up to 24 months.
Patients completed the following patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as part of the trial protocol: (i) the Numerical Rating Scale-11, which is a measure of pain intensity, (ii) the Brief Pain Inventory Pain Interference subscale, which is a measure of the impact of pain on daily functioning and (iii) the Pediatric Quality of Life (QoL) Inventory NF1 module, which is a measure of disease-specific health-related QoL impact across 16 domains. These PRO measures showed statistically significant improvement with mirdametinib in multiple areas, including tumor pain intensity reduction from baseline by cycle 4 in the total sample, cognitive function improvement from baseline at cycle 8 in the total sample and QoL improvement by cycle 8 for patients who achieved a partial response. 
Mirdametinib was generally well tolerated in this trial. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events reported. Two treatment-related Grade 3 events, occurring in the same patient, were reported. The most common adverse events of any grade were acneiform rash (95%), fatigue (58%), and nausea (53%). Five patients (26%) had dose reductions due to adverse events, including one patient for Grade 3 abdominal and/or back pain, one patient for Grade 2 nausea, one patient for Grade 2 fatigue and two patients for Grade 1 rash. No patients discontinued treatment due to dose limiting toxicity. Five patients discontinued mirdametinib treatment: four due to low-grade rash that was perceived to be intolerable and one due to noncompliance with the trial protocol.
Mirdametinib ReNeu trial in NF1-PN and regulatory pathway
Given the degree of clinical benefit observed in patients with NF1-PN in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial of mirdametinib, and informed by our discussions with the FDA, we initiated the potentially registrational ReNeu clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ReNeu trial is a Phase 2b, longitudinal, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mirdametinib in patients at least two years of age with an inoperable NF1-PN that is causing significant morbidity or major deformity. The ReNeu trial is being conducted at clinical sites in 

28



North America. As in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial in NF1-PN patients, mirdametinib is being administered orally at a 2 mg/m2 BID dose with a maximum dose of 4 mg BID (without regard to food). Dosing is occurring on a four-week cycle with a three weeks-on, one week-off schedule. The intervention period will last for up to 24 cycles. In contrast to the previous Phase 2 clinical trial, we have designed our ReNeu trial with an intervention period that we believe is optimized to demonstrate the full antitumor activity of mirdametinib in NF1-PN patients.
We anticipate enrolling approximately 100 patients in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial, roughly half of whom will be pediatric patients. As of February 2021, the ReNeu trial has reached approximately 70% of its final enrollment target, and we expect to complete enrollment in the second half of 2021. The primary endpoint is ORR measured using three-dimensional MRI volumetric analysis and assessed by blinded independent central review, or BICR. As in the previous Phase 2 clinical trial, an objective response is defined as a decrease of at least 20% in tumor volume in the target NF1-PN by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include the duration of response and health-related quality-of-life measurements.
Interim clinical data
In February 2021, we reported interim clinical data from the first 20 adult patients enrolled in the Phase 2b ReNeu trial. Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in the table below.

As of the data cutoff date of January 22, 2021, 10 of these 20 patients (50%) had achieved an objective response, as assessed by a reduction of at least 20% in tumor volume by BICR. The following chart shows the best percent change in tumor volume from baseline in these first 20 adult patients.

Regulatory pathway
In October 2018, the FDA granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1, in May 2019, the FDA granted mirdametinib Fast Track Designation for the treatment of patients at least two years of age with NF1-associated inoperable PN that are progressing or causing significant morbidity and in July 2019, the European Commission granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1. If the results of the Phase 2b clinical trial are favorable, we plan to file for marketing approval for mirdametinib in the U.S. and select international markets.
Mirdametinib in combination with a RAF dimer inhibitor (lifirafenib)
Overview
In September 2018, we entered into a global clinical collaboration with BeiGene to evaluate the combination of mirdametinib with BeiGene’s RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib, in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring RAS mutations, RAF mutations or other MAPK pathway aberrations. Lifirafenib has been observed to potently inhibit BRAF, CRAF and ARAF across all homodimeric and heterodimeric conformations of these proteins that have been evaluated. Furthermore, monotherapy lifirafenib has shown activity in tumors harboring RAS and RAF mutations in a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by BeiGene. We believe that lifirafenib’s clinical activity can be enhanced with the addition of a potent and selective MEK inhibitor like mirdametinib and provide a potentially promising combination therapy for cancers whose growth is reliant on MAPK pathway signaling, such as those with mutations in RAS or RAF. In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial being 

31



conducted by BeiGene that is currently enrolling patients in the U.S. and Australia with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway.
Disease background
RAS mutations
RAS mutations are one of the most common genetic aberrations found in human cancers and these driver mutations are found in approximately 25% of all solid tumors, representing over 200,000 new patients diagnosed in the U.S. each year. RAS proteins, which are comprised of the KRAS, HRAS and NRAS isoforms, are central to the transduction of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and lead to downstream activation of the canonical RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade of the MAPK pathway.
The following table illustrates the reported prevalence of KRAS and NRAS mutations in selected types of solid tumors.

​

32



We believe that effective therapies for patients harboring RAS mutations represent a significant clinical need. To date, MEK or RAF inhibitors used as monotherapies have generally demonstrated only limited clinical activity in patients whose tumors harbor RAS mutations. These tumors are generally poorly responsive to targeted therapies and RAS mutations typically confer poor prognosis, although outcomes can vary across different cancer types with RAS mutations.
RAF mutations
RAF mutations have been reported in up to 7% of all solid tumors, with the most widely described being the BRAF V600 mutations, commonly found in patients with metastatic melanoma. While there are approved MEK-RAF targeted combination therapies for patients with BRAF V600 mutations, patients eventually progress on these therapies representing a significant unmet clinical need.
In addition, there have been numerous non-V600 BRAF mutations described, which are not responsive to the currently approved therapies, and the use of the existing therapies has been shown to paradoxically increase the ability of tumor cells with these non-V600 BRAF mutations to proliferate.
Other MAPK aberrations
Patients with mutations and aberrations in the MAPK pathway aside from RAS and RAF mutations also represent a substantial unmet clinical need owing to a lack of approved therapies. Such tumors include malignant cancers driven by NF1 mutations, such as MPNST.
Current treatment landscape
We are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of cancers harboring RAS mutations. There are several approved therapies in indications where RAS mutations are frequent, though these therapies are not specifically designed to address RAS mutations. There are multiple programs in clinical development today for RAS-mutant solid tumors that are evaluating various mechanisms of action.
For RAF mutations, we are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA for treatment of patients harboring non-V600 BRAF mutations. There are several approved therapies in indications where RAF mutations are frequent, though none are designed to address RAF mutations aside from those therapies targeting BRAF V600 mutations, and even for these an unmet medical need exists because patients eventually progress on these therapies.
For patients whose tumors harbor other MAPK aberrations, we are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA. There are several approved therapies in indications where we believe such MAPK pathway aberrations are frequent, though these therapies are not specifically designed to address these aberrations.
Our solution—combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib
We believe that the biological rationale and the differentiated pharmacological properties of mirdametinib in combination with lifirafenib support the potential to provide significant clinical benefit in these large genetically defined tumor populations with significant unmet medical need. Our ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of the novel combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib is among the first clinical trials evaluating vertical inhibition of the MAPK pathway using a RAF dimer inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor. We believe this combination has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit in patients with solid tumors harboring RAS mutations, RAF mutations and other MAPK pathway aberrations.
Preclinical data with the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib demonstrating antitumor activity in RAS mutant cancer models were presented at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, Conferences. A variety of MEK inhibitors were evaluated in combination with lifirafenib in this preclinical study, and mirdametinib was observed to be among the MEK inhibitors with the highest synergy and the most potent antitumor activity in combination. Additional preclinical data from studies of mirdametinib in combination with lifirafenib presented at the 

33



2020 AACR Virtual Annual Meeting II demonstrated potent and synergistic activity in vitro and in vivo across a panel of cancer models harboring a variety of RAS mutations. BeiGene’s lifirafenib has demonstrated antitumor activity as a monotherapy in a completed Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RAS and RAF mutated solid tumors and was observed to be generally well tolerated. 
​
Combination mechanism of action
Given lifirafenib’s activity profile, we believe that it is among the most promising RAF inhibitors. In particular, lifirafenib has been observed to inhibit both dimeric and monomeric forms of RAF, which we believe should overcome the paradoxical MAPK pathway activation seen with several other RAF inhibitors. Furthermore, lifirafenib has shown potent inhibition in preclinical studies across all RAF isoforms tested. We believe these two attributes are primarily responsible for the monotherapy activity data observed with this compound in its Phase 1 clinical trial.
Currently approved RAF inhibitors were designed to address tumors whose growth is reliant upon signaling via monomeric forms of BRAF, such as those with BRAF V600 mutations, a subset of MAPK aberrations commonly found in metastatic melanoma. In this setting, the addition of a MEK inhibitor to a BRAF V600 inhibitor showed significant clinical activity beyond monotherapy BRAF inhibition. By targeting both monomeric and dimeric forms of RAF, RAF dimer inhibitors, such as lifirafenib, are designed to work in tumors beyond just those harboring BRAF V600 mutations and therefore have the potential to address a much broader range of genetically defined patient populations. This includes RAS-mutant cancers, which predominantly signal through hetero- and homodimeric RAF; both of these conformations are potentially addressed by lifirafenib.

34



The following illustration depicts how the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib is intended to vertically inhibit the MAPK pathway to prevent the proliferation and survival of cancer cells reliant upon this pathway.

​
We believe that by vertically inhibiting two key, adjacent constituents of the MAPK pathway, the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib can potentially address the resistance mechanisms and feedback loops that have prevented development of therapies for many devastating cancers harboring MAPK pathway gene mutations, such as those in RAS, RAF and NF1. In particular we believe that the Phase 1 clinical data demonstrated lifirafenib’s activity across both monomeric and dimeric forms of RAF, as well as mirdametinib’s observed clinical pharmacodynamic activity at low doses, provide the opportunity for a leading combination therapy to address tumors with aberrant MAPK signaling.
Combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib clinical trial
In May 2019, we announced the initiation of an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of mirdametinib and lifirafenib. This clinical trial is enrolling patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring relevant genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway. This clinical trial is being conducted by BeiGene in collaboration with us in both the U.S. and Australia. The clinical trial is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, we intend to determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination therapy. In the second stage, the trial is expected to enroll expansion cohorts comprised of patients with tumor types and mutational backgrounds of interest, which may include non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial cancer with KRAS mutations, to assess antitumor efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination therapy at the recommended Phase 2 dose. We expect to report initial clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial in 2021.

In June 2019, we announced the formation of MapKure, which is jointly owned by us and BeiGene. BeiGene licensed to MapKure exclusive rights to BGB-3245, a novel, oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of monomeric and dimeric forms of activating BRAF mutations, including V600 BRAF mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations and RAF fusions. MapKure is advancing BGB-3245 through clinical development for solid tumor patients harboring BRAF driver mutations and BRAF fusions that were observed to be sensitive to the compound in preclinical studies. In February 2020 MapKure, BeiGene and SpringWorks announced the initiation of a Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion clinical trial evaluating BGB-3245 in adult patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors harboring specific genetic mutations that based on preclinical results are predicted to be sensitive to treatment with BGB-3245. We expect to report initial clinical data from the ongoing trial in 2021.
In addition to our significant, but non-controlling equity ownership in MapKure, we have one seat on each of MapKure’s joint steering committee and its board of directors. We are also contributing to the clinical development of BGB-3245 and other operational activities through a service agreement with MapKure.
Based on preclinical data, we believe that BGB-3245 may be unique in its BRAF binding and disassociation properties, potentially enabling differentiated antitumor activity as compared to other known RAF inhibitors. We believe this may better position BGB-3245 for clinical development as a monotherapy in certain biomarker defined patient populations. These biomarkers include de novo Class 2 BRAF mutations, de novo BRAF fusions and BRAF resistance mutations following treatment with BRAF V600 inhibitors. 
To date, approximately 200 unique mutant BRAF alleles have been identified in human tumors. Activating BRAF mutations have been categorized into three classes: Class 1 mutants, comprised of constitutively active monomers, such as V600E mutations, Class 2 mutants, comprised of constitutively active dimers, and Class 3 mutants, which are kinase-impaired or kinase-dead. Today, only Class 1 BRAF mutations have any approved targeted therapeutic options, such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. The following table summarizes the distribution of BRAF mutations that have been described in the scientific literature as of 2017.

Despite the clinical activity of approved BRAF inhibitors in patients with Class 1 BRAF mutations, emerging evidence suggests that resistance commonly develops via mutations that enable ligand independent signaling by dimerization of the protein, such as p61 BRAF V600E and BRAF V600E/L514V, which represent an area of unmet medical need. BGB-3245 has demonstrated preclinical activity against these mutations.
Furthermore, BRAF fusion proteins have recently been described as drivers of cancer cell growth, and patients can now be screened for such fusions in the clinical setting. Recent literature suggests that these mutations may account for 0.3% of all human cancers, with 20 novel BRAF fusions now identified across 12 distinct tumor types, with enrichment in specific cancers. We believe that BGB-3245 may also address patients with these BRAF fusions.
License and collaboration agreements
Pfizer license agreements
We were originally conceived by Pfizer as an innovative way to advance investigational therapies that may hold significant promise for underserved patients, and Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., DFAPA, the former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer, is a member of our board of directors. Pfizer initially made an equity investment and also contributed royalty- and milestone-bearing product licenses, including for our two lead product candidates, nirogacestat and mirdametinib.
A description of each of our license agreements with Pfizer is set forth below:
Nirogacestat license agreement
In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Nirogacestat License Agreement, with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired exclusive (including as to Pfizer) worldwide sublicensable rights to research, develop and manufacture nirogacestat for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases and commercialize nirogacestat for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of all diseases other than Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Additionally, Pfizer agreed that, for ten years, it would not conduct a clinical trial of a gamma secretase inhibitor for desmoid tumors. Pfizer retained rights to commercialize nirogacestat for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. We subsequently amended the Nirogacestat License Agreement in July 2019 with regard to certain provisions relating to intellectual property.
Pursuant to the Nirogacestat License Agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S. If, following regulatory approval in the U.S., we reasonably anticipate that the product will receive a certain level of reimbursement in certain countries, then we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for the product in such country and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in such country.
We are required to pay Pfizer up to an aggregate of $232.5 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestone events.
We will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of nirogacestat at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low 20s, that may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third-party licenses and generic competition.
Unless earlier terminated, the Nirogacestat License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim. Following expiration of the applicable royalty period for a country, we will continue to have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to all IP licensed during the royalty period for such country. We have the right to terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement if the other party 

37



is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Nirogacestat License Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. If Pfizer terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach or our insolvency, Pfizer retains its license with respect to targets for which it has exercised an option (unless Pfizer elects otherwise), subject to reduced payment obligations.
Mirdametinib license agreement
In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Mirdametinib License Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired exclusive (including as to Pfizer) worldwide sublicensable rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize mirdametinib for the treatment of all diseases. Additionally, Pfizer agreed, that for ten years, it will not conduct a clinical trial with a MEK inhibitor for NF1, but excluding a MEK inhibitor owned or controlled by a third party that acquires, or is acquired by, Pfizer. We subsequently amended the Mirdametinib License Agreement in August 2019 with regard to certain provisions relating to intellectual property.
Pursuant to the Mirdametinib License Agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S. If, following regulatory approval in the U.S., we reasonably anticipate that the product will receive a certain level of reimbursement in certain countries, then we will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for the product in such country and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in such country.
We are required to pay Pfizer up to an aggregate of $229.8 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestone events.
We will pay Pfizer tiered royalties on sales of mirdametinib at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low 20s, that may be subject to deductions for expiration of valid claims, amounts due under third party licenses and generic competition.
Unless earlier terminated, the Mirdametinib License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim. Following expiration of the applicable royalty period for a country, we will continue to have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to all IP licensed during the royalty period for such country. We have the right to terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Pfizer may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Mirdametinib License Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. If Pfizer terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach or our insolvency, Pfizer retains its license with respect to targets for which it has exercised an option (unless Pfizer elects otherwise), subject to reduced payment obligations.
BeiGene clinical collaboration agreement
In August 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with BeiGene, the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining BeiGene’s investigational RAF dimer inhibitor, lifirafenib (BGB-283), and mirdametinib, in a Phase 1b clinical trial for patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.
We and BeiGene are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our respective activities for the clinical trial. BeiGene is responsible for administering the clinical trial and we are responsible for performing the fixed dose formulation activities at our cost. Each party will be solely responsible for its costs associated with manufacturing and supply of its compound for the clinical trial. Upon completion of the clinical trial, if the parties agree that certain pre-defined criteria have been satisfied, the parties will negotiate in good faith a definitive agreement to provide for the 

38



expansion of the clinical collaboration and a commercial relationship based on specified principles, provided that neither party is obligated to enter into such definitive agreement.
We will share with BeiGene equally the costs associated with the clinical trial. The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee of equal representation from us and BeiGene.
During a specified exclusivity period, neither party will develop or commercialize the other party’s compound. Further, for a certain period following the effective date of the agreement, neither party will clinically develop (or prepare to clinically develop) or commercialize the combination of certain inhibitors in any form, or any products containing any such combination, except as permitted by the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement will expire on the one-year anniversary of the date that BeiGene provides the final clinical trial report for the clinical trial to us. Either party may terminate the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) either party entirely ceases all development of its compound, (ii) either party reasonably concludes that there is a patient safety issue or (iii) if a regulatory authority withdraws approval for either party’s compound or the clinical trial. Either party may also terminate the BeiGene Collaboration Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period.
GlaxoSmithKline clinical collaboration agreement
In June 2019, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with GSK, the GSK Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf), GSK’s BCMA ADC, which was approved by the FDA in August 2020 as a monotherapy treatment for adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), with such combination trial also in patients with RRMM in an adaptive Phase 1b clinical trial.
GSK is responsible for administering the clinical trial and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. The collaboration is managed by a joint development committee of equal representation by us and GSK. Following completion of the clinical trial, within a specified period of time, either party may propose new agreements for the purpose of performing one or more additional clinical trials of the combination therapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. If a party proposes to conduct an additional clinical trial, the parties will negotiate in good faith, without obligation, the details of a definitive agreement to provide for the expansion of the clinical collaboration. If the parties do not reach an agreement, and only one party wishes to proceed with an additional clinical trial, it may do so if the other party does not object to the protocol based on safety concerns.
Unless earlier terminated, the GSK Collaboration Agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either party may terminate the GSK Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) if either party commits a material breach of the GSK Collaboration Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period, (ii) either party files a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings and such proceedings are not dismissed within a certain time period, (iii) due to regulatory action that prevents a party from supplying its compound or if a party, in its own discretion, determined to discontinue the manufacture or development of its compound for medical, scientific or legal reasons, (iv) either party concludes in good faith that there is a Material Safety Issue, as defined in the GSK Collaboration Agreement, or (v) if a clinical hold with respect to either party’s compound arises during the term of the GSK Collaboration Agreement.
Allogene clinical collaboration agreement
In January 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Allogene, the Allogene Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with ALLO-715, Allogene’s investigational allogeneic BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell product, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Allogene is responsible for administering the Phase 1 clinical trial and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to 

39



intellectual property rights. The collaboration is managed by a joint development committee of equal representation by us and Allogene. 
Unless earlier terminated, the Allogene Collaboration Agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either party may terminate the Allogene Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) if either party commits a material breach of the Allogene Collaboration Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period, (ii) either party files a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings and such proceedings are not dismissed within a certain time period, (iii) due to regulatory action that prevents a party from supplying its compound or if a party, in its own discretion, determined to discontinue the manufacture or development of its compound for medical, scientific or legal reasons, (iv) either party concludes in good faith that there is a Material Safety Issue, as defined in the Allogene Collaboration Agreement, or (v) if a clinical hold with respect to either party’s compound arises during the term of the Allogene Collaboration Agreement.
Janssen clinical collaboration agreement
In September 2020, we entered into a clinical collaboration and supply agreement with Janssen, the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate our investigational gamma secretase inhibitor, or GSI, nirogacestat, in combination with Janssen’s bispecific antibody targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and CD3, teclistamab, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
​
Janssen is responsible for administering the Phase 1 clinical trial and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. The collaboration is managed by a joint oversight committee of equal representation by us and Janssen.
​
Unless earlier terminated, the Janssen Collaboration Agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either we or Janssen may terminate the Janssen Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) if either party commits a material breach of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period, (ii) if either party concludes in good faith that the study may unreasonably affect patient safety and safety issues are unable to be addressed by amendment to the protocol, or (iii) due to regulatory action that prevents a party from supplying its compound or if a party, in its own discretion, determined to discontinue the manufacture or development of its compound for medical, scientific or legal reasons. Janssen may terminate the Janssen Collaboration Agreement for any reason so long as it provides advance written notice to us as specified in such agreement. We may terminate the Janssen Collaboration Agreement and supply of nirogacestat if we reasonably and in good faith believe nirogacestat is not used by Janssen as described in the protocol. 
Precision clinical collaboration agreement
In September 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Precision, the Precision Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with PBCAR269A, an investigational allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy candidate targeting BCMA, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
​
Precision is responsible for administering the Phase 1/2a clinical trial and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee of equal representation by us and Precision. Following completion of the clinical trial, within a specified period of time, either party may propose new agreements for the purpose of performing one or more additional clinical trials of the combination therapy. If a party proposes to conduct an additional clinical trial, the parties will negotiate in good faith, without obligation, the details of a definitive agreement to provide for the expansion of the clinical collaboration.
​
Unless earlier terminated, the Precision Collaboration Agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either party may terminate the Precision Collaboration Agreement as follows: (i) if either party commits a material breach of the Precision Collaboration Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period, (ii) either party files a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings and such proceedings are not 

40



dismissed within a certain time period, (iii) due to regulatory action that prevents a party from supplying its compound or if a party, in its own discretion, determined to discontinue the manufacture or development of its compound for medical, scientific or legal reasons, (iv) either party concludes in good faith that there is a Material Safety Issue, as defined in the Precision Collaboration Agreement, or (v) if a clinical hold with respect to either party’s compound arises during the term of the Precision Collaboration Agreement. In addition, Precision may terminate the Precision Collaboration Agreement if it determines, following a review of available data, that further development or commercialization of the combination therapy is not commercially reasonable.
​
Pfizer clinical collaboration agreement
In October 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Pfizer, the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, to evaluate nirogacestat in combination with Pfizer’s bispecific antibody targeting BCMA and CD3, elranatamab, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
​
Pfizer is responsible for administering the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial and is responsible for all costs associated with the direct conduct of the clinical trial, other than the manufacture and supply of nirogacestat and certain expenses related to intellectual property rights. The collaboration is managed by a joint development committee of equal representation by us and Pfizer.
​
Unless earlier terminated, the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement will expire upon completion of the analyses contemplated by the clinical trial. Either we or Pfizer may terminate the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement: (i) if either party commits a material breach of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period, (ii) if either party concludes in good faith that the study may unreasonably affect patient safety and safety issues are unable to be addressed by amendment to the protocol, or (iii) due to regulatory action that prevents a party from supplying its compound or if a party, in its own discretion, determined to discontinue the manufacture or development of its compound for medical, scientific or legal reasons. SpringWorks may terminate the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement and supply if SpringWorks reasonably and in good faith believes nirogacestat is being used in an unsafe manner and Pfizer fails to reasonably and in good faith address such issue.
​
Jazz Pharmaceuticals asset purchase and exclusive license agreement
​
In October 2020, we announced an asset purchase and exclusive license agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, or Jazz, the Jazz Agreement, pursuant to which Jazz acquired our fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH, inhibitor program including PF-04457845. Jazz made an upfront payment of $35 million to us with potential future payments of up to $375 million based upon the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, Jazz is obligated to pay us sales-based royalties on future net sales of PF-04457845.
​
Pursuant to the Jazz Agreement, Jazz is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for at least one product in the U.S. and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize such product in the U.S. 
​
Unless earlier terminated, the Jazz Agreement shall remain in effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such product in such country, as defined in the Jazz Agreement. Either party may terminate the Jazz Agreement if either party commits a material breach of the Jazz Agreement that is not cured within a certain time period. Jazz may terminate the Jazz Agreement for any reason so long as it provides advance written notice to us as specified in such agreement.
Manufacturing
We rely on third parties to manufacture nirogacestat and mirdametinib. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce drug substance for the nirogacestat and mirdametinib programs.
We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We currently rely solely on these CMOs for scale-up and process development work 

41



and to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time to cover commercial production. We may also elect to enter into agreements with other CMOs to manufacture supplies of drug substance and finished drug product.
Sales and marketing
If any of our product candidates are approved, we intend to market and commercialize them in the U.S. and select international markets, either alone or in partnership with others.
Many desmoid tumor and NF1-PN patients are managed by specialist physicians, including oncologists, medical geneticists and neurologists, and therefore we believe can be reached with a targeted sales force.
For our product candidates being explored in combination with other agents or in highly prevalent diseases, we intend to establish commercialization strategies for each in collaboration with our partner as we approach potential marketing approval, and will share responsibilities in a manner that takes into account our respective commercial infrastructures, competencies and country-specific expertise.
Educational and patient initiatives
We actively collaborate with desmoid tumor and NF1-PN constituents through a number of initiatives, including participation in patient meetings and educational initiatives. Examples of such constituents include the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, COG and Children’s Tumor Foundation. We undertake these activities in order to better understand the burdens and unmet needs these patients face so that we can more effectively facilitate their access to our product candidates, if approved. In each of these disease areas we will support disease awareness and diagnosis and subsequent treatment of identified patients, by providing information, increasing physician awareness and creating more efficient referral pathways.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid evolution of technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with approved treatment options, including off-label therapies, and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key considerations that would impact our ability to effectively compete with other therapies include the efficacy, safety, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection of our products. Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products.
For our program in desmoid tumors, where there are no therapies currently approved by the FDA, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Corporation, Cellestia Biotech AG and Iterion Therapeutics, Inc. We are also aware of several therapies, some of which are generic, that are used off-label for the treatment of desmoid tumors. These therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, such as liposomal doxorubicin and vinblastine/methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-hormonal therapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, imatinib and pazopanib.
For the treatment of NF1-PN, AstraZeneca’s Koselugo is currently the only therapy approved by the FDA. We are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including Array BioPharma Inc. (a subsidiary of Pfizer), Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Exelixis, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Infixion Bioscience, Inc., NFlection Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis International AG and Teton Therapeutics LLC. We are also aware of several 

42



therapies, some of which are generic, that are used off-label for the treatment of NF1-PN. These therapies include radiotherapy and various systemic treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
​
For our targeted oncology portfolio, we are aware that other oncology focused companies are or may be developing products for the treatment of solid tumors with RAS mutations, RAF mutations and other MAPK aberrations, including Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd., Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Day One Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Kinnate Biopharma Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna Inc., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Revolution Medicines, Inc., TheRas, Inc. and Wellspring Biosciences, Inc. There may be additional companies with programs suitable for addressing these patient populations that could be competitive with our efforts but that have not yet disclosed specific clinical development plans. In addition we are aware that other oncology focused companies are or may be developing products targeting BCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients, including AbbVie Inc., Amgen Inc, AstraZeneca PLC, Autolus Therapeutics plc, bluebird bio, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cartesian Therapeutics, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Heidelberg Pharma GmbH, Legend Biotech Corporation, Novartis International AG, Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Seagen.
Smaller or early-stage companies, including oncology-focused therapeutics companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling patients in clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The availability of reimbursement from government and private payors will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approvals for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to commercialize our product candidates.
Intellectual property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuit of U.S. and foreign patent applications related to proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, such as compositions of matter and methods-of-use, that we determine are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we, our licensors, or our collaborators currently have, or are pursuing, patents covering the composition of matter for our product candidates and we plan to generally pursue patent protection covering methods-of-use for one or more clinical programs. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Patents
At the time we were formed in August 2017, we entered into license agreements with Pfizer for our lead product candidates, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights under Pfizer patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize our lead product candidates.
We have exclusive licenses under the Nirogacestat License Agreement to patent rights in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to nirogacestat. The patent rights in-licensed under the Nirogacestat License Agreement include five granted patents in the U.S. (with the agreement originally covering three such patents, and two additional patents having been subsequently granted based on work conducted by us and with Pfizer’s consent) and more than 25 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. A U.S. patent covering nirogacestat as a composition of matter has a statutory expiration date in 2025 and a U.S. composition of matter patent that covers the polymorphic form of nirogacestat that is currently in clinical development 

43



expires in 2039, in each case, not including patent term adjustment or any patent term extension, and relevant foreign counterparts are expected to expire in 2025, in each case, not including any patent term extensions. In addition, a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office has been received for a patent application with composition of matter claims covering several polymorphic forms of nirogacestat, including the polymorphic form that is currently in clinical development and which is also covered by the above referenced U.S. patent. The patent issuing from this application will also expire in 2039. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of nirogacestat for the treatment of desmoid tumors, we expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. See “License and collaboration agreements—Pfizer license agreements” above for additional information on our rights under the Nirogacestat License Agreement. Nirogacestat received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of desmoid tumors.
​
We have exclusive licenses under the Mirdametinib License Agreement to patent rights in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to mirdametinib. The patent rights in-licensed under the Mirdametinib License Agreement include two granted patents in the U.S. and more than 45 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. A U.S. patent covering mirdametinib as a composition of matter has a statutory expiration date in 2021, not including patent term adjustment or patent term extension, and relevant foreign counterparts are expected to expire in 2021, in each case, not including any patent term extensions. With patent term adjustments, the U.S. patent expires in 2022. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of mirdametinib for the treatment of NF1, we expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. See “License and collaboration agreements—Pfizer license agreements” above for additional information on our rights under the Mirdametinib License Agreement. The FDA has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1-PN, and the European Commission has granted mirdametinib Orphan Drug Designation for NF1.
For combination therapeutics involving nirogacestat or mirdametinib, there may be opportunities to enhance our patent estate, which we will explore. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these efforts.
Trade secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drug products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular 

44



drug products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the U.S. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under certain federal governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the U.S., the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to biologics, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost sharing obligation imposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time-consuming process.
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit.
In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the European Union, or EU, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as nirogacestat, mirdametinib and our other product candidates. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety 

45



and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority and submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Clinical trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time, or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being 

46



exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the IRB or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements related to registration and reporting of certain clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
U.S.—FDA regulation
Approval process
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, 

47



and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. This requirement applies on the later of 60 days after the date of enactment or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,875,842 for Fiscal Year 2021, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees for eligible products, which are currently $336,432 for Fiscal Year 2021.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the 

48



potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change.
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Patent term extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension for one patent. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from approval.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Orphan drugs

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or therapeutic biologic will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Such a designation, may also be revoked by the FDA in 

49



certain circumstances, such as if the agency finds that the applicant’s request for designation request omitted material information required under the Orphan Drug Act and its implementing regulations. 
Fast Track Designation and accelerated approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment, and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Under the Fast Track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Breakthrough therapy designation
Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA provides more extensive development consultation opportunities with FDA senior staff, allows for the rolling review of the drug’s application for approval and indicates that the product could be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of application submission for drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Disclosure of clinical trial information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be 

50



delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
EU regulation
In the EU, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD, or the Common Technical Document, with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 was adopted. Currently, the regulation is anticipated not to come into effect before December 2021. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the EU, we may submit Marketing Authorization Applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the 

51



centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

● | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting an MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
EU regulatory exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
EU orphan designation and exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU, are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

52



The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:

● | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Other regulations – rest of the world
For other countries outside of the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other healthcare laws
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General and HHS Office for Civil Rights, other divisions of the HHS and the Department of Justice.
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. On November 20, 2020, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG finalized further modifications to the AKS. Under the final rule, OIG added safe harbor 

53



protections under the AKS for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. The final rule (with some exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, this rule will have on our business.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., or off-label), and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under these laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, although it is unclear that we would be considered a “business associate” in the normal course of our business. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be 

54



imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. See “European data collection” below for a discussion of data privacy and security enactments of the EU.
For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect in January 2020, and the California Attorney General has since promulgated final regulations. The law provides broad rights to California consumers with respect to the collection and use of their personal information and imposes data protection obligations on certain businesses. While the CCPA does not apply to protected health information that is subject to HIPAA or personal information collected, used or disclosed in research, as defined by federal law, the CCPA may still affect our business activities. Moreover, on November 3, 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, under a ballot initiative. The CPRA amends the existing CCPA to include new consumer rights and additional data protection obligations. The new data protection requirements under the CPRA apply to information collected on or after January 1, 2022. With the promulgation of final regulations, the California State Attorney General has commenced enforcement actions against CCPA violators. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA and the amendments under the CPRA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. The California law further expands the need for privacy and process enhancements and commitment of resources in support of compliance. Moreover, more than ten states have proposed bills in the last year with provisions similar to the CCPA and CPRA. It is likely that other states will pass laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA in the near future and a federal data protection law may also be on the horizon.
​
Similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government 

55



funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
European data collection
The collection and use of personal health data in or arising from the EU are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in respect of clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Current and future legislation
In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs address a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establish annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and create a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Since then, the ACA 

56



risk adjustment program payment parameters have been updated annually. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially given the new Biden Administration. 
Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:

● | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027, unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions are suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic.

● | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. The Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration also previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Blueprint contains certain measures that HHS is already working to implement. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021.
Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the U.S. have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain

product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Corporate history and information
We were originally formed in Delaware in August 2017 and until March 29, 2019, we conducted our business through SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization and merger that was completed on March 29, 2019, or the Reorganization, all of the equity interests in SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC were exchanged for the same number and class of newly issued securities of SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. and, as a result, SpringWorks Therapeutics, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. 
​
On September 17, 2019, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 10,350,000 shares of common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,350,000 additional shares of our common stock, at the public offering price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $169.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upon the closing of the IPO, our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock. 
​
On October 13, 2020, the Company completed the sale of 5,637,254 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering, including 735,294 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriter's full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at an offering price of $51.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $269.5 million.
