Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 
We are a healthy beverages and lifestyles company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic, natural and other better-for-you healthy beverages, liquid dietary supplements, cannabidiol (“CBD”) topical products, and other healthy lifestyle products. We compete in the growth segments of the beverage industry as a leading one-stop shop supplier for major retailers and distributors. We also are one of a few companies that commercializes its business across multiple channels including traditional retail, ecommerce, direct to consumer, and medical channels. We offer liquid dietary supplement products, including Tahitian Noni® Juice, through a direct-to-consumer model using independent distributors (called independent product consultants or “IPCs”). We market a full portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) better-for-you beverages including competitive offerings in the kombucha, tea, yerba mate, coffee, functional waters, relaxation drinks, energy drinks, rehydrating beverages, and functional medical beverage segments. We differentiate our brands through functional performance characteristics and ingredients, and offer many products that are 100% organic and natural, with no high-fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), no genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), no preservatives, and only natural flavors, fruits, and ingredients. We rank among the largest healthy-beverage companies in the world as well as one of the fastest growing beverage companies according to Beverage Industry Magazine annual rankings and Markets and Markets. Our goal is to become the world’s leading healthy beverage company, with leading brands for consumers, leading growth for retailers and distributors, and leading return on investment for shareholders. Our target market is health conscious consumers, who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift towards alternative beverage choices and away from less healthy options such as carbonated soft drinks or other high caloric beverages. We believe consumer awareness of the benefits of healthier lifestyles and the availability of heathier beverages is rapidly accelerating worldwide, and we are seeking to capitalize on that shift.
Corporate History
 
New Age Beverages Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington in April 2010 under the name American Brewing Company, Inc. (“American Brewing”). On April 1, 2015, American Brewing acquired the assets of B&R Liquid Adventure, which included the brand Búcha® Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring the Búcha® Live Kombucha brand and business, we were a craft brewery operation. In October 2015, we sold the American Brewing division, including its brewery and related assets, to focus exclusively on healthy beverages. In April 2016, new management assumed daily operation of the business, and began the implementation of a new vision for the Company. In May 2016 we changed our corporate name to Búcha, Inc. (“Búcha”), and then on June 30, 2016, we acquired the combined assets of Xing Beverage, LLC, New Age Beverages, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, and New Age Properties. We then shut down all California operations where Búcha was based, relocated the Company’s operational headquarters to Denver, Colorado and changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation.
 
In February 2017, we up-listed to the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In March 2017, we acquired the assets of Maverick Brands, including its brand Coco Libre®. In June 2017, we acquired the assets of Premier Micronutrient Corporation (“PMC”), and also completed the acquisition of Marley Beverage Company (“Marley”) including the brand licensing rights to Marley® brand RTD beverages.
 
On December 21, 2018, we completed a business combination with Morinda, whereby Morinda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Morinda is a Utah-based healthy lifestyles and beverage company founded in 1996 with operations in more than 60 countries around the world, and manufacturing operations in Tahiti, the U.S., China, Japan, and Germany. Morinda was the first company to commercially globally sell products derived from the noni plant, an antioxidant-rich, natural resource found in French Polynesia. Morinda is primarily a direct-to-consumer and ecommerce business working with approximately 280,000 independent contractor IPCs and customers worldwide. More than 60% of its business is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The combination with Morinda provided the Company with an augmented portfolio of healthy beverages, with multi-channel penetration spanning traditional retail, ecommerce, and in-home, and hybrid route-to-market spanning direct-store-delivery (“DSD”), wholesale, and direct-to-consumer.

On July 10, 2019, we completed a business combination with Brands Within Reach, LLC (“BWR”) whereby BWR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. BWR owns key licensing and distribution rights in the United States for some of the world’s leading beverage brands including Nestea®, Volvic®, Evian® and Illy® Ready-to-Drink Coffee. We have established our new North American operations location at BWR’s leased facility north of New York City in Mamaroneck, New York.
 
We have four direct subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. These subsidiaries consist of Morinda (doing business as Noni by NewAge), BWR, NABC, Inc., and NABC Properties, LLC (“NABC Properties”). NABC, Inc. is a Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of the Company’s subsidiaries and divisions. NABC Properties administers a building owned by New Age in southern Colorado. We previously had a subsidiary, New  Age Health Sciences, Inc., that was merged with and into NABC in November 2019.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our operating segments have consisted of the Morinda segment and the NewAge segment. We recently announced that Morinda has begun doing business as Noni by NewAge, thereby refocusing on the rich Tahitian heritage of our noni-based product offerings and cinching the tie with New Age Beverages. As a result of this change, throughout this Report we refer to our former Morinda segment as the Noni by NewAge segment of our business.
 
The Noni by NewAge segment is engaged in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of Tahitian Noni® Juice, MAX and other noni beverages as well as other nutritional, cosmetic and personal care products. The Noni by NewAge segment has manufacturing operations in Tahiti, Germany, Japan, the United States, and China. The Noni by NewAge products are sold and distributed in more than 60 countries using IPC’s through its direct to consumer selling network and e-commerce business model. Approximately 80% of the net revenue of the Noni by NewAge segment is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia.
 
The NewAge segment manufactures, markets and sells a portfolio of healthy beverage brands including Xing® Tea, Marley, Búcha® Live Kombucha, Coco-Libre®, Evian® and Volvic®. These products are distributed through the Company’s DSD network and a hybrid of other routes to market throughout the United States and in 15 countries around the world. The NewAge brands are sold in all channels of distribution including hypermarkets, supermarkets, pharmacies, convenience, gas and other outlets.
 
Principal Products
 
Our core business is developing, marketing, selling, and distributing healthy liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink beverages. The beverage industry comprises $1 trillion in annual revenue according to Euromonitor and Booz & Company and is highly competitive with three to four major multibillion-dollar multinational companies dominating the sector. We compete by differentiating our brands as healthier and better-for-you alternatives that are natural, organic, have no artificial ingredients or sweeteners, or a combination of those features. Our brands include Tahitian Noni® Juice, TruAge®, Xing® Tea, Aspen Pure®, Marley®, Búcha® Live Kombucha, PediaAde™, Coco Libre®, BioShield™, and ‘NHANCED™ Recovery, all competing in the beverage industry. Noni by NewAge also has several additional consumer product offerings, including a TeMana® line of skin care and lip products, a Noni + Collagen ingestible skincare product, Noni + CBD, and wellness supplements.
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our RTD beverage products using a range of marketing media, including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.
 
We currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team consisting of approximately 75 people throughout the United States, whose compensation is variable and performance-based. Each salesperson has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion, and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As distribution to new major customers, new major channels, or new major markets increases, we will expand the sales and marketing team on a variable basis.
 
We use a direct selling model to market our Tahitian Noni and TeMana products through and to approximately 280,000 IPCs and customers in over 60 countries around the world. Noni by NewAge has offices and employees in 25 countries to motivate, educate, and assist IPCs in their efforts.

Distribution
 
Our products are currently distributed in over 60 countries, and in all 50 U.S. states through a hybrid of four routes to market (including our own DSD system that reaches more than 6,000 outlets) and to more than 35,000 other outlets throughout the United States—directly through customers’ warehouses, through our network of DSD partners and through our network of brokers and distributors. Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations—and direct to consumers through individual independent distributor IPCs and e-commerce.
 
Our sales strategy seeks to distribute our products worldwide to consumers in the most cost-efficient method possible. We sell our products direct to consumers through IPC’s and our own ecommerce system and other ecommerce systems, through retail customers across grocery, gas, convenience, pharmacy, mass, club and other channels, to major foodservice customers, to alternative channel customers including juice/smoothie shops, military, office, and health clubs, and through hospitals, outpatient doctor offices, and other channels.
 
Direct-to-Consumer Distribution of Tahitian Noni, TruAge, TeMana, and Other Products
 
Independent Product Consultants (“IPCs”)
 
People who wish to sell Noni by NewAge branded products (including Tahitian Noni and TeMana) through our person-to-person sales model must enroll as IPCs in our independent sales force. New IPCs are sponsored by an existing IPC, and the new IPC becomes a member of the sponsoring IPC’s sales organization. Newly enrolled IPCs must sign a written agreement or alternatively accept the terms and conditions of the agreement online at the Company’s website. The agreement requires all IPCs to comply with the Noni by NewAge policies and procedures, including that IPCs will: (i) safeguard and protect the reputation of the Company and its products; (ii) refrain from any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful consumer or recruiting practices; (iii) refrain from any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful claims about the Company’s products or compensation plan; and (iv) refrain from promoting or selling products that are competitive to the Company’s flagship products, or promoting other network marketing opportunities to IPCs whom they did not personally sponsor with the Company. The Company may take disciplinary action (up to and including termination of an IPCs purchase and sales organization rights) if an IPC violates these policies and procedures. In many markets, IPCs must purchase a nominally-priced starter kit (approximately $35) which includes sales and educational materials. No commissions are paid on the purchase of a starter kit. The Company policies and procedures manual is available to IPCs in this kit as well as online at the Company’s website. No investment or product inventory purchase is required to become an IPC.
 
After enrolling, IPCs may purchase products directly at wholesale (member) pricing for resale to their customers as well as for personal use. IPCs may build sales organizations by sponsoring and enrolling new IPCs. As IPCs sponsor others, generational levels are created in the IPC’s organizational structure (referred to as a “downline”). As these IPCs continue to sponsor others, their sales organization forms a part of the greater sales organization of the upline sponsors. We have no requirements for IPCs to sponsor new IPCs, and IPCs are not compensated for recruiting or sponsoring others. All IPC compensation is based on product sales of that IPC and part of their downline organization. Subject to payment of a nominal annual renewal fee (which is waived for active sales activity of an IPC at the time of renewal), IPCs may continue to purchase our products at member pricing and establish a sales organization while in compliance with our policies and procedures.
 
Although our global compensation plan is designed generally to permit IPCs to establish downlines without country or border limitations, our business and compensation plan for China must be executed in a modified form due to Chinese laws and regulations. Only individuals who are residents of China and are eligible to work there may enroll as IPCs or as customers in China. The same general policies and procedures described above, modified for China, apply to IPCs in China. According to Chinese regulations, non-China residents are not permitted to sponsor IPCs in China, or otherwise participate in the compensation plan for China.
 
IPC Training and Motivation
 
An IPC’s sponsor provides the initial training about our products and compensation plan. Other IPCs in the sponsor’s sales organization typically assist with this training. Our policies require that a sponsor must maintain an ongoing professional leadership association with IPCs in their sales organization. We develop training materials and sales tools to assist IPCs with this training and in building their sales organizations. We also conduct online trainings and webinars, regional, national, and international IPC events, as well as intensive leadership training events. Attendance at these events is voluntary, and IPCs may attend the events that they feel will most benefit them and their sales organization. We have found that the most successful and productive IPCs tend to be those who take advantage of these events. While Noni by NewAge employees work to support the IPCs and to provide them with training materials and sales tools, we rely on our IPCs to operate as the sales force for Noni by NewAge, and to sell products, sponsor new IPCs and customers to sell and purchase our products, and to train new IPCs regarding our products and compensation plan.

IPC Compensation
 
Our compensation plan has several attractive features and provides several opportunities for IPCs to earn compensation. IPCs understand that success comes from the effort, dedication, resources, and time they commit to their business. The compensation opportunities require that IPCs consistently work at building, training, and retaining their sales organizations to sell our products to consumers. Each compensation opportunity is designed to reward dedicated IPCs for directly and indirectly generating product sales through their sales organization and to consumers. All compensation is conditioned on the IPC’s good standing and compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures and the laws of the country where the IPC does business
 
The integration of our compensation plan across international markets (except China) allows IPCs to earn commissions from global product sales along with local product sales. We believe our compensation plan is one of the most attractive and lucrative offered by any direct selling company—and is thus a significant aspect of our ability to expand internationally.
 
Customers
 
Noni by NewAge also has a customer program. Individuals may enroll as customers and purchase products for their personal use only. Customers do not resell or distribute our products. The customer program allows us to include individuals who wish to use our products but who do not wish to participate in the business. Customers are not eligible to earn commissions. Customers may upgrade their account at any time to become an IPC to then participate in the business and compensation plan and be eligible to earn commissions.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
Our manufacturing and bottling facilities are in American Fork, Utah; Mataiea, Tahiti; Chongqing, China; and Alamosa, Colorado, with contract manufacturing and bottling in Tokyo, Japan; Bad Liebenwerda, Germany; and ten other facilities throughout the US. Each of our products are produced to exacting specifications and standards, and subject to strict quality control procedures.
 
Our Coco Libre brand of coconut water is sourced from young coconuts on the southeastern coast of Vietnam, which we believe produces the sweetest and most complex flavored coconut water of any major competitor. Xing, Búcha, and Marley products are produced using our proprietary blends and production processes.
 
Our noni fruit is harvested from noni trees on 18 islands of French Polynesia by approximately 2,000 harvesters, who are independent contractors, and who work and coordinate with Company representatives on each island. All fruit is checked at the time of harvest for quality, maturity, and purity. To date, we have maintained good relations with our suppliers and have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the noni fruit.
 
The noni fruit is then shipped to our 85,000 square foot processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti, where the fruit is again checked before being processed. This facility, as well as all facilities that produce products for us, adheres to the Good Manufacturing Practices as established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Tahiti facility is well-maintained, and the buildings and equipment are kept clean and in good repair and technology is up to date. The facility is regularly inspected by the French Polynesian authorities and by the FDA.
 
At this processing facility, the seeds are separated from the fruit. The seeds are later processed for oil extraction. The fruit is extensively inspected, pasteurized, and turned into puree, which is the key component of our Tahitian Noni Juice. The pasteurized puree is checked for quality and hermetically sealed in tote bins which are shipped by sea to ports in the United States, Japan, China and Germany for manufacturing our products. Each day the equipment used at this facility is automatically cleaned by a three step clean-in-place (“CIP”) system. This system ensures the cleanliness of the equipment, tanks, and pipes used in the processing of the puree.
 
Reliance on Third-Party Suppliers and Distributors
 
Except as noted above, we rely on various suppliers for the raw and packaging materials, production, sale, and distribution of our products. Third-party distributors cover places outside of our owned DSD distribution network. The material terms of these relationships are typically negotiated annually and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third-party distribution needs and also have long-term relationships with our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.

The contractual arrangements with third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with third party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.
 
Competition
 
The beverage industry, specifically the healthy beverage industry, and the direct selling industries are multi-billion-dollar industries which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations and from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share. We also face stiff competition to engage IPCs that sell our direct-to-consumer products.
 
The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and have more name recognition than we have. However, we believe that, with our diverse product line, consisting of noni juice, TeMana Products, kombucha tea, green tea, water, energy beverages, and new CBD-infused beverages, we will have the ability to compete effectively in the industry and increase our market share.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
Our mission to only provide healthy functional beverages with real efficacy for consumers governs our development efforts. Our research and development (“R&D”) efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on consumer insights and trends and competitive opportunities.
 
Our new products and R&D efforts in our Health Sciences Division are science-backed by the patents, cooperative research studies, and human and animal trials acquired from PMC. They are targeted toward fundamental human needs, segments that do not yet exist in beverages but do exist in the pharmaceutical arena, and opportunities where NewAge can gain first mover advantage. A guiding principle of “no compromise” governs our development efforts.
 
Noni by NewAge has an R&D group that is closely aligned with and supports the goals and plans of the Company. In addition to developing new healthy and scientifically sound products and reviewing and improving existing formulas and processes for cost reductions, Noni by NewAge R&D continues to conduct and publish new, cutting edge benefits research on noni and other new products. R&D is an integral part of the global corporate structure providing timely technical, regulatory, quality, processing and scientific standards, data, and expertise as needed and requested. Noni by NewAge R&D, in partnership with other departments, maintains an extensive intellectual property database of patents, publications, formulations and ideas that help protect and keep the Company in the forefront of healthy beverage offerings and product development. Noni by NewAge R&D administers laboratories that provide analytical, chemical, microbiological, nutritional, and biochemical capabilities. We believe that we own the only lab in the world dedicated to the study of the noni plant and pioneering new innovative applications for noni.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We hold numerous issued U.S. patents and trademarks and have rights to additional U.S. patents under license agreements. We also hold issued patents and trademarks in other countries. In addition, we have pending U.S. and international patent applications that cover numerous inventions. We also maintain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries as well as pending trademark applications in the U.S. and other countries and have rights to additional U.S. and international trademarks under license agreements.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and unpatented know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements.
 
Under a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:
 

● | below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | naturally occurring; 
● | the result of necessary cooking; or 
● | subject to another applicable exemption. 

 
One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future.
 
We use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. We also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
Our facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our Company’s capital expenditures, net income, or competitive position.
 
We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The interpretation and application of data privacy and data protection laws and regulations are often uncertain and are evolving in the United States and internationally. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business and develop strategies to address regulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of our beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the peak summer months accounting for a higher level of sales. Our net revenue during the second and third quarters of the year has historically accounted for approximately 60% of annual revenue, and this seasonality is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 934 employees globally, including 28 that worked for us on a part time basis. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
