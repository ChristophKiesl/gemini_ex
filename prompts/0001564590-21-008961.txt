ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 Overview   Glatfelter is a leading global supplier of engineered materials.  Our high-quality, innovative, and customizable solutions are found in tea and single-serve coffee filtration, personal hygiene as well as in many diverse packaging, home improvement and industrial applications. Our annual net sales approximate $916 million with customers in over 100 countries. We own and operate eleven manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our facilities have a combined production capacity of approximately 298,000 metric tons of composite fibers and airlaid materials used in a wide array of applications. In addition, we operate sales and distribution offices in Russia, Italy, China, and the United States.
 Glatfelter has undergone a strategic transformation focused on becoming a leading engineered materials company accelerating growth through innovation and sustainability. The transformation includes unlocking value through the realignment of our product portfolio, investing in strategic growth opportunities, delivering shareholder distributions, and creating financial capacity for strategic flexibility. Our portfolio now consists of leading positions serving markets growing at or above gross domestic product rates, a predictable cash flow profile, and significantly improved adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”).
 We manage our business and make investment decisions under a functional operating model with two distinct reporting segments: Composite Fibers and Airlaid Materials. These segments serve growing global customers and markets providing innovative and customizable solutions, ultimately delivering high-quality engineered materials. As a leading global supplier of engineered materials for consumer and industrial applications, we partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have divested non-strategic assets and made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands and grow our sales. We are committed to growing with our key markets and will make appropriate investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands.
 On January 5, 2021, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Georgia-Pacific's U.S. nonwovens business ("G-P”) for $175 million. This business includes the Mount Holly, NC manufacturing facility with annual production capacity of approximately 37,000 metric tons and an R&D center and pilot line for nonwovens product development in Memphis, TN. G-P had annual net sales of approximately $100 million. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory clearances. Additional information related to this pending acquisition is set forth in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 3 – “Acquisitions.”

Composite Fibers is comprised of five paper making facilities (Germany (3), France and England), a metallizing operation (Wales) and a pulp mill (the Philippines). The combined attributes of the facilities are summarized as follows (in metric tons):
 
 
Production Capacity | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM | 
------------------------------------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------
145,000 lightweight and other paper | Abaca pulp | | 14,900
 | Wood pulp | | 86,000
 | Synthetic fiber | | 20,500
15,700 metallized | Base stock | | 13,350
15,000 abaca pulp | Abaca fiber | | 23,700

 
Composite Fibers’ lightweight products are produced using highly specialized inclined wire paper machine technology.
 The primary raw materials used in the production of our lightweight materials are softwood pulps, abaca pulp, and other specialty fibers. Enough quantities of abaca pulp and its source material, abaca fiber, are important to support growth in this segment. Abaca pulp, a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability globally, is produced by our Philippine pulp mill, providing a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers segment. As the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands.
 In addition to critical raw materials, Composite Fibers’ production cost is influenced by the price of electricity and natural gas. In 2020, Composite Fibers purchased approximately 77% of its electricity needs, the cost of which is influenced by the natural gas markets. In addition, the segment generates all the steam used in production by burning natural gas.
 In Composite Fibers’ markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single serve coffee & tea | Ahlstrom, Purico, Miquel y Costas and Zhejiang Kan 
Wallcovering | Mayak & Technocell JV, Neu Kaliss, Goznak, Kämmerer and Ahlstrom 
Technical specialties | Nippon Kodoshi Corp ("NKK"), Kan Kyo Technology, Burrows and Suominen Oyj 
Composite laminates | Schweitzer-Maudit, Purico, Miquel y Costas, MB Papeles Especiales and Oi Feng 
Metallized | AR Metallizing, Torras Papel Novelis, Vaassen, Galileo Nanotech, and Wenzhou Protec Vacuum Metallizing Co.

 
Our strategy in Composite Fibers is focused on:
  
• | leveraging innovation resources to drive plastic free applications, and new product and new business development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | optimizing our asset utilization and product portfolio while capitalizing on growing global markets in beverage filtration, electrical storage and consumer products trends;

AIRLAID MATERIALS   Airlaid Materials, with annual net sales of approximately $391.4 million, is a leading global supplier of highly absorbent and engineered cellulose-based airlaid nonwoven materials, primarily used to manufacture consumer products for growing global end-user markets. Our products are composed of all-natural fluff pulp, which is sustainable by design. The categories served by Airlaid Materials include:

• | feminine hygiene and other hygiene products;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | specialty wipes;
--+-----------------


• | tabletop;
--+----------


• | home care;
--+-----------


• | adult incontinence; and
--+------------------------


• | other consumer and industrial products.
--+----------------------------------------

 Airlaid Materials’ customers are industry leading consumer product companies as well as private label converters. We believe this business holds a leading position in the majority of the markets it serves. Airlaid Materials has developed long-term customer relationships through superior quality, customer service, and a reputation for quickly bringing product and process innovations to market.
 This segment’s net sales composition by categories is set forth in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 8 – “Revenue. “
 The feminine hygiene category accounted for 52% and 51% of Airlaid Material’s net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Most feminine hygiene sales are to a group of large, leading global consumer products companies. We believe these markets are growth oriented due to population growth in certain geographic regions and changing consumer preferences. In developing regions, demand is also influenced by increases in disposable income and cultural preferences. 
 Airlaid Materials operates state-of-the-art facilities in Falkenhagen and Steinfurt, Germany, Gatineau, Canada and Fort Smith, Arkansas. 
 Airlaid Materials’ four facilities operate with the following combined attributes (in metric tons):
 
 
Airlaid Production Capacity (metric tons) | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
------------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------+--------
 | 153,000 | | Fluff pulp | | 122,000

 
Key raw material used in the airlaid production process other than fluff pulp include synthetic fibers, super absorbent polymers, and latex. The cost to produce is influenced by the cost of critical raw materials and energy prices. Airlaid Materials purchases substantially all the electricity and natural gas used in its operations. Approximately 74% of this segment’s net sales in 2020 was earned under contracts whose selling price is influenced by pass-through provisions directly related to the cost of certain key raw materials.
 Airlaid Materials continues to be a technology and product innovation leader in technically demanding segments of the markets it serves. Its airlaid material production employs multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies as opposed to other methods such as hydrogen-bonding. We believe that its facilities are among the most modern and flexible airlaid facilities in the world, allowing it to produce at industry leading operating rates. Its proprietary single-lane festooning technology provides converting and product packaging capabilities which supports efficiency in the customers converting processes. Airlaid Materials’ in-house technical expertise combined with significant capital investment requirements and rigorous customer expectations creates large barriers to entry for new competitors.
 The following summarizes Airlaid Materials’ key competitors:

In recent years, our TCIR has consistently ranked in the top quartile of safety performance in our industry. 
 Talent Attraction, Retention and Development  Our employees make essential contributions to our success and ability to drive growth and innovation. Even as the organization has undertaken substantial change in recent years, our vision and Core Values remain the center of our steadfast compliant culture. We are always working to enhance our human resources programs by implementing and integrating enterprise-level processes for talent attraction, career development and training. Creating a best-in-class, globally consistent process for these employee experiences has become even more important as part of our strategic transformation and the move of our corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina. 
 Glatfelter supports its team by providing fair wages, competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, diverse wellness programs and other benefits to help enhance the lives of our employees. We regularly review our employee offerings to ensure we are positioned to attract and retain world-class talent.
