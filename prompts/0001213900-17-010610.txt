Retail Communications offerings include our flagship ‘Boss Revolution’ branded PIN-less international long distance prepaid calling offerings as well as traditional, disposable hard cards sold under a variety of brands. In the United States, the majority of our customers purchase Retail Communications offerings through one of our more than 35,000 Boss Revolution authorized resellers. These resellers are typically small, independent retailers serving foreign-born communities. Boss Revolution customers can also purchase calling services directly through our IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, website (www.bossrevolution.com), or mobile calling app available free on both the iTunes App Store and Google Play.
 
Our Wholesale Carrier Services business terminates international long-distance calls for our retail customers and for other telecommunications companies, service providers, and resellers around the world.

Our Payment Services vertical includes international mobile top-up (IMTU) offerings sold through our retail network or directly from the Boss Revolution online/mobile platform and Boss Revolution Money app, our Boss Revolution international money transfer service and our National Retail Solutions business. IMTU is sold under the Boss Revolution brand as well as through mobile operator top-up cards sold by Boss Revolution resellers. Our Boss Revolution international money transfer business includes remittances from the United States to over 30 countries. It is offered through certain Boss Revolution resellers as well as the Boss Revolution online/mobile platform and Boss Revolution Money app.
 
Our National Retail Solutions, or NRS, business is also part of our Payment Services vertical and provides point of sale (POS) terminals and services linked to those terminals - including consumer rewards programs, credit card processing and coupon program participation - to independent retailers in the United States.

OUR STRATEGY
 
History and Background
 Since our founding, we have focused on value creation by leveraging potentially disruptive telecommunications, payment and other technologies to challenge entrenched business models. Outside of our core businesses, we sought to select and incubate promising early stage businesses and, in some cases, have sold those businesses or spun them off to our stockholders.
 
In 2007 and 2008, in response to a long-term, industry-wide decline in the sale of prepaid, disposable calling cards, which was our dominant offering at the time, we initiated a fundamental restructuring of our businesses. We right-sized corporate overhead, reduced network costs at IDT Telecom, streamlined our operations, and refocused on the growth and profitability of our core telecommunications businesses. We subsequently spun off certain non-core businesses and assets to our stockholders, including CTM Media (2009), Genie Energy (2011), Straight Path Communications (2013), and Zedge (2016). In October 2014, we completed the sale of our interest in Fabrix, a network storage and processing technology business, to Ericsson for $69 million in cash as part of Ericsson’s purchase of Fabrix for $95 million.
 
In 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our IDT Financial Services Holdings Limited subsidiary, a Gibraltar-based bank and e-money issuer across the European Economic Union, to JAR Fintech Limited, for approximately $18 million, which we expect to close in calendar 2017.
 
Within IDT Telecom, we reduced the cost of our infrastructure while leveraging our VoIP expertise and large retail network to develop new products and services. We also sharpened our retail focus to provide high-quality, cost-effective communications and payment services primarily to foreign-born consumers. This is a historically underserved market that includes significant numbers of unbanked and under-banked consumers.
 
As part of our effort to meet the changing demands of our target demographic, in 2008 we launched Boss Revolution PIN-less, a pay-as-you-go international long-distance voice service. The service grew rapidly and eventually overtook sales of our traditional, disposable prepaid calling cards. We believe that Boss Revolution PIN-less has become the nation’s leading pay-as-you-go international calling service. We subsequently developed and introduced complementary payment services over the Boss Revolution platform, including international and domestic airtime top-up, gift cards, domestic bill payment and an international money transfer service. These additions represent significant milestones toward our goal of offering a comprehensive suite of voice and payment products under a single, global brand and platform targeted to under-banked, foreign-born consumers.
 
To simplify the Boss Revolution PIN-less calling experience and extend its reach, we introduced our Boss Revolution Calling mobile app in 2013. The app is free to the consumer and is distributed through both the iTunes and Google Play app stores. In 2017, we introduced a Boss Revolution retailer portal that can be accessed via the web browser on a mobile device to enable any qualified individual in the United States with an Android or iOS smartphone to become a Boss Revolution retailer and to manage their Boss Revolution account virtually anywhere, anytime. In 2017, we introduced the BOSS Revolution Money app, which works seamlessly with the Boss Revolution calling app to let customers send money transfers, mobile airtime top-up and electronic gift cards to family and friends easily and securely.
 
Leveraging the high volumes of traffic to certain overseas destinations generated by our retail business, we have long been a significant operator in the global wholesale telecommunications market, carrying and terminating international calling traffic on behalf of other telecommunications companies and call aggregators. More recently, we have maintained our leadership in the wholesale market by leveraging VoIP technology and broadening our offerings with different levels of service quality.
 
In 2015, we refocused our net2phone division to provide cloud-based communications to small and medium-sized businesses. Unlike most other competitors in this space, net2phone works exclusively through the agent channel, provisioning its service through third-party technology providers and other value-added resellers.
 
Recent Strategic Developments
 In August 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to reorganize us into three separate entities by spinning off two non-core business units and certain assets, one of which was Zedge, to our stockholders, which we completed on June 1, 2016. Throughout fiscal 2017, we prepared to spin off additional non-core assets including our interests in two clinical and early stage pharmaceutical companies - Rafael Pharmaceuticals and Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - and our real estate holdings to our shareholders as Rafael Holdings, Inc. In addition, we intend to contribute $50 million to $60 million in cash to Rafael Holdings, Inc. prior to the spin-off.
 
IDT Telecom
 IDT Telecom’s largest offerings, including its Boss Revolution prepaid PIN-less calling services and wholesale termination business, face intense competitive pressures on revenues and margins. In response, IDT Telecom is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy that includes:
 

■ | Reducing the cost of operating our network, streamlining operations, and right sizing overhead; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Expanding our national network of 35,000+ Boss Revolution retailers;

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
IDT TELECOM
 IDT Telecom reports financial and operational results in three reportable segments: Telecom Platform Services, Unified Communications as a Service, and Consumer Phone Service. Since our inception, we have derived the majority of our revenues and operating expenses from IDT Telecom’s businesses. In fiscal 2017, IDT Telecom had revenues of $1,499.0 million, representing 99.8% of our total consolidated revenues, and income from operations of $23.6 million, as compared with revenues of $1,484.8 million and income from operations of $32.4 million in fiscal 2016.
TELECOM PLATFORM SERVICES
 Our Telecom Platform Services segment, which represented 97.5% and 97.0% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, markets and distributes multiple communications and payment services across three business verticals:

■ | Retail Communications provides international long-distance calling products primarily to foreign-born communities worldwide, with its core markets in the United States; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Wholesale Carrier Services is a global telecom carrier, terminating international long distance calls around the world for Tier 1 fixed line and mobile network operators, as well as other service providers; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Payment Services provides payment offerings, including international and domestic airtime top-up, international money transfer, and our merchant service offerings through POS terminals. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During fiscal 2017, our Telecom Platform Services segment generated $1,464.1 million in revenues worldwide and income from operations of $24.4 million, as compared with revenues of $1,451.6 million and income from operations of $32.8 million in fiscal 2016.
 
Retail Communications
 Retail Communications’ revenue was $610.2 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $664.9 million in fiscal 2016 (41.7% and 45.8% of Telecom Platform Services’ revenue in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively).
 
Most of Retail Communications’ sales are generated by the Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling service. Other smaller lines of business contribute to Retail Communications sales, including (1) traditional, disposable prepaid calling cards sold under a variety of brand names both domestically and overseas, (2) private label and IDT branded prepaid and point of sale activated calling cards sold to large retailers, medium sized retail chains (e.g. supermarkets, drug stores), and smaller grocery stores and similar outlets, and (3) our PennyTalk international calling service. Other revenues generated using our Boss Revolution platform, including airtime top-up and international money transfer, are reflected in the Payment Services vertical discussed below.
 
Boss Revolution PIN-less allows users to call their families and friends overseas without the need to enter a personal identification number, or PIN. To place a call, a customer must first establish a Boss Revolution prepaid account. Boss Revolution customers can access our network by dialing a local access or toll-free number. Our platform recognizes the user’s network-provided automatic number identification (ANI) and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding Boss Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. The dialing process is automated to provide one-touch dialing in the Boss Revolution Calling app.

Boss Revolution customers’ account balances are typically debited at a fixed rate per minute. In contrast to many competitors, Boss Revolution does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. Boss Revolution per minute rates can vary by the destination country, city, and whether the call is a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the Boss Revolution consumer website and within the Boss Revolution Calling app. In addition to per minute prepaid plans, Boss Revolution offers unlimited calling plans for a flat monthly fee to some destinations.
 
Customers can add to, or top-up, their account balance at any Boss Revolution retailer using cash, a debit card or a credit card. Customers with a credit card, debit card or store-bought top-up voucher can also add to their account balance directly by phone, online through the Boss Revolution consumer web site (www.bossrevolution.com), or through the Boss Revolution Calling or Money apps.
 
In the United States, we distribute many of our retail products through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sells to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells Boss Revolution platform products directly to retailers. Also, the Boss Revolution Calling app is available for download through both the iTunes and Google Play stores. Distributors, our internal sales people and retailers typically receive commissions based on the revenue generated by each transaction.
 
In 2017, we introduced a Boss Revolution retailer portal that can be accessed via the web browser on a mobile device to enable any qualified individual in the United States with an Android or iOS smartphone to become a Boss Revolution retailer and to manage their Boss Revolution account virtually anywhere, anytime. The Boss Revolution retailer portal enables retailers to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions for the various products and services available on the portal. The Boss Revolution retailer portal also provides a direct, real-time interface with our retailers, resulting in a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that can rapidly respond to changes in the business environment.
 
The Boss Revolution platform allows us to target and promote services directly to distributors, retailers and customers and to introduce and cross-sell offerings. In 2017, we introduced the BOSS Revolution Money app, which works seamlessly with the Boss Revolution Calling app to let customers send money transfers, mobile airtime top-up and electronic gift cards to family and friends easily and securely.
 
In the United States, the Boss Revolution brand is supported by national, regional and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising, print media, and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events.
 
Retail Communications’ sales have traditionally been strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network and their large foreign-born populations. We continue to grow distributor relationships and expand our retail network in other areas of the United States, including the Southwest and West Coast, where we historically have not had as strong of a market presence.
 
We expect to launch Boss Revolution Mobile before the end of calendar 2017. Boss Revolution Mobile will be a domestic mobile service operating on Sprint’s nationwide network offering an innovative, low-cost model for mobile service under our Boss Revolution brand.
 
Wholesale Carrier Services
 Wholesale Carrier Services’ revenue was $608.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $567.4 million in fiscal 2016 (41.6% and 39.1% of Telecom Platform Services’ revenue in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively).
 
Wholesale Carrier Services terminates international telecommunications traffic in more than 170 countries around the world. The division’s customers include our Retail Communications business, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers’ traffic in exchange for terminating our wholesale and retail traffic with them.
 
We offer competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We can offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our Retail Communications business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers and market makers, and an extensive network of interconnects around the globe.
 
IDT Telecom terminated 26.6 billion minutes in fiscal 2017, as compared to 27.4 billion minutes in fiscal 2016, making us one of the largest carriers of international long-distance minutes worldwide. Wholesale Carrier Services accounted for 19.9 billion minutes and 19.3 billion minutes of the total IDT Telecom minutes in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

IDT Telecom has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers outside the United States, particularly Tier 1 providers in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market.
 
Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long-distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues.
 
In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2017, Wholesale Carrier Services had more than 3,000 customers. IDT Telecom has over 600 carrier relationships globally.
 
Wholesale Carrier Services’ revenue is generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators.
 
In fiscal 2017, we announced an outsourcing initiative, Voicehub, to help fixed and mobile telephony operators enhance the profitability and value of their international voice operations. Wholesale Carrier Services will provide these operators with customized solutions including full outsourcing, handing all inbound and outbound calls with or without switch management, and hybrid arrangements whereby the operator retains certain routes or customers directly.
 
Payment Services
 Payment Services’ revenue was $245.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $219.3 million in fiscal 2016 (16.7% and 15.1% of Telecom Platform Services’ revenue in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively).
 
Most of Payment Services’ revenue is generated by the sale of international airtime top-up offerings. Other products and services in this vertical include domestic airtime top-up, gift cards sold in the United States and Europe, domestic bill pay service, our international money transfer service, our merchant services through POS terminals offerings and, until its expected sale in the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, the operations of our Gibraltar-based bank. Payment Services’ offerings leverage our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our global reach to provide convenient and affordable offerings primarily over the Boss Revolution platform.
 
Our international airtime top-up products enable customers to purchase airtime for a prepaid mobile telephone in another country. They are sold both over our Boss Revolution platform and in hard card format. Our international airtime top-up offerings are focused on geographic corridors, such as the United States to various Central American countries, that tend to generate high volumes of business, and are part of a comprehensive product offering that includes product, marketing and distribution focused on those corridors.
 
International remittances are a significant economic activity among our target market of foreign-born residents and other under-banked communities. Our international money transfer service is offered over the Boss Revolution platform, and like other payment services, utilizes our retail network and associated ability to serve unbanked customers. However, we expect that only a limited number of Boss Revolution retailers in the United States will eventually qualify to process international money transfer transactions.
 
Revenues from international money transfer are derived from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Transaction costs include commissions paid to the retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, and foreign currency exchange costs.
 
Our merchant services business, National Retail Solutions, was founded in fiscal 2016 to help bodegas and other independent retailers serving immigrant communities compete more effectively against big-box retailers and retail chains.  NRS’s services leverage its nationwide network of point-of-sale (POS) terminals installed with bodegas nationwide.  NRS designed the POS terminals which offer versatile functionality including barcode scanners, customer and retailer facing hi-definition screens, and credit card readers.  At September 30, 2017, NRS had deployed over 3,500 POS terminals.

-

 

NRS derives revenue from the sale of the POS terminals to retailers, a monthly recurring fee for use of the terminals, and additional terminal-based marketing, advertising and payment services sold a la carte. These include data analytics, vendor payouts, inventory control, credit card processing and display advertising. 
 
NRS also aggregates the market power of its retailer network to provide compelling offerings for consumer-packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers and distributors who otherwise do not have an efficient channel to access independent, urban and immigrant-focused retailers.  NRS offers CPG suppliers access to its retailer network and to their customers through its popular customer loyalty program, the BR Club.  NRS’s offerings to CPG companies include coupon distribution and redemption capabilities and new product placement and promotion. 
 
The NRS merchant services business is synergistic with other BOSS Revolution communications and payment services including PIN-less calling, international and domestic money transfer, and sales of international mobile top-up products.  BR Club members receive promotional text and in-store promotions for IDT’s calling and payment services offerings, all of which can be sold and provisioned by retailers directly from their NRS terminals.
 
Payment Services also includes reloadable prepaid debit cards marketed across the European Economic Area and Bank Identification Number (BIN) sponsorship services offered by our Gibraltar-based bank, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter of calendar 2017.
 
International Operations
 Internationally, we are a provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through an extensive network of thousands of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling and domestic and international airtime top-up and payment services in select global markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. Wholesale Termination and related wholesale services are marketed and sold globally through our internal Carrier Sales team.
 
In Europe, we market our Retail Communications products in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Austria, seeking to capitalize on the demographic opportunity presented by immigration from outside of Europe to these developed nations. Because the immigrant market is fragmented, and due to the large number of markets in which we compete, we offer over 470 different prepaid calling cards in Europe. In addition, we sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile Calling app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, we sell the Prime Card, a leading prepaid MasterCard through select retailers and online directly to consumers.
 
Our operations in Europe also include Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our European corporate, Retail Communications and Wholesale Carrier Services operations in London, England. We also operate satellite offices in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Greece.
 
Our European operations, including Wholesale Carrier Services and Retail Communications, generated $408.9 million of revenues in fiscal 2017, an 11% increase from the $368.5 million of revenues generated during fiscal 2016. Our European operations’ revenues constituted 27.3% of IDT Telecom’s revenues in fiscal 2017, as compared to 24.8% in fiscal 2016.
 
In Asia, we sell Retail Communications products in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Malaysia. In Hong Kong, we are one of the top providers of prepaid calling services to the Filipino, Indian and Indonesian populations, three of the largest overseas worker segments there. In addition, in Singapore, our Retail Communications products are a market leader to the Indian, Indonesian and Bangladeshi populations, which are among the largest ethnic segments in Singapore. We sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile Calling app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In Asia, we also sell postpaid services direct to consumers and small businesses. In fiscal 2017, IDT Telecom generated $43.7 million in revenues from our operations in the Asia Pacific region compared to $45.4 million in fiscal 2016. Our operations in Asia also include Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong.
 
In Latin America, we market Retail Communications products in Argentina and Brazil. In addition, we offer SIP Trunking VoIP services in Brazil to large enterprise businesses. In fiscal 2017, net2phone began offering its Hosted PBX services in Brazil and Argentina. We maintain our Latin American headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Sao Paulo, Brazil. In fiscal 2017, IDT Telecom generated $10.4 million in revenues from the sale of Retail Communications and UCaaS products in Latin America compared to $13.3 million in fiscal 2016.

Telecommunications Network Infrastructure
 IDT Telecom operates a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without waiting for third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over commercially available alternatives.
 
The IDT Telecom core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows IDT Telecom to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support its global reach, IDT Telecom operates voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. IDT Telecom receives and terminates voice traffic from every country in the world, including cellular, landline and satellite calls through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. It is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States. More recently, we started to make use of one of the leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.
 
UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AS A SERVICE (UCAAS)
 UCaaS’ revenue was $29.4 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $26.4 million in fiscal 2016. UCaaS’ loss from operations was $1.9 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016.
 
UCaaS’ revenue is generated primarily by VoIP products and services sold under the net2phone brand. net2phone’s VoiP offerings include (1) cable telephony, (2) cloud-based private branch exchange, or PBX, services offered to enterprise customers exclusively through value-added resellers (VARs), service providers, telecom agents and managed service providers, (3) Session Initiation Protocol, or SIP, trunking, which supports inbound and outbound domestic and international calling from an IP PBX, and (4) PicuP, a highly-automated business phone service that answers, routes and manages voice calls. In fiscal 2017, net2phone launched cloud-based PBX services in Brazil and Argentina, leveraging IDT’s local licenses, telephony platform and infrastructure. net2phone plans to expand into new markets in South America, Europe and Asia focusing on its cloud-based PBX product set.
 
IDT continues to optimize and improve its cable telephony platform to reduce the underlying costs of service and increase the speed of deployment.

CONSUMER PHONE SERVICES
 Our Consumer Phone Services segment generated revenues of $5.5 million and income from operations of $1.1 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to revenues of $6.9 million and income from operations of $1.2 million in fiscal 2016.
 
During fiscal 2017, we continued to operate the business in harvest mode-maximizing revenue from current customers while maintaining expenses at the minimum levels essential to operate the business. This strategy has been in effect since calendar 2005 when the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, decided to terminate the UNE-P pricing regime, which resulted in significantly inferior economics in the operating model for this business. We expect the Consumer Phone Services’ customer base and revenues will continue to decline in fiscal 2018.
 
We currently provide our bundled local/long distance phone service in 11 states, marketed under the brand name IDT America. Our bundled local/long distance service, offered predominantly to residential customers, includes unlimited local, regional toll and domestic long distance calling and popular calling features. A second plan is available, providing unlimited local service with our long distance included for as low as 3.9 cents per minute. With either plan, competitive international rates and/or additional features can be added for additional monthly fees. We also offer stand-alone long-distance service throughout the United States.
 
At July 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,500 active customers for our bundled local/long distance plans and approximately 14,500 customers for our long distance-only plans, compared to approximately 4,200 and 18,100 customers, respectively, on July 31, 2016. Our highest customer concentrations are in large urban areas, with the greatest number of customers located in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
 
ALL OTHER
 Operating segments that are not reportable individually are included in All Other. During fiscal 2017, All Other generated $2.7 million in revenues and income from operations of $0.3 million, compared to revenues of $11.5 million and income from operations of $4.2 million during fiscal 2016.
 
All Other also includes our real estate holdings, and other smaller businesses.
 
We own the approximate 496,000 square-foot building in Newark, New Jersey in which our headquarters is located, and we occupy approximately 20% of that building. We also own an 800-car public parking garage located across the street from that building. In addition, we own a building in Piscataway, New Jersey that is used partially by IDT Telecom for certain of its operations and a 12,400 square foot condominium interest in a building in Jerusalem, Israel.
 
In fiscal 2016 and 2017, we made investments totaling $10 million in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, a clinical stage, oncology-focused pharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of therapies that exploit the metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells. Our 90%-owned subsidiary, IDT-Rafael Holdings, LLC, or IDT-Rafael Holdings, owns direct and indirect interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals. IDT-Rafael Holdings owns a 50% interest in CS Pharma Holdings, LLC, or CS Pharma.  CS Pharma owns $10 million in Convertible Series D Notes issued by Rafael Pharmaceuticals. We and CS Pharma hold warrants to purchase up to 56%, in the aggregate, of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, on an as-converted and fully diluted basis.
 
The Rafael Pharmaceuticals Series D Note earns interest at 3.5% per annum, with principal and accrued interest due and payable on September 16, 2018. The Series D Note is convertible at the holder’s option into shares of Rafael Pharmaceuticals Series D Preferred Stock at a price of $1.25 per share, subject to downward adjustment if there are interim financings of Rafael Pharmaceuticals at lower prices and certain other events. The Series D Note also includes a mandatory conversion into Rafael Pharmaceuticals common stock upon a qualified initial public offering of Rafael Pharmaceuticals.
 
The right to exercise Rafael Pharmaceuticals warrants as to the first $10 million thereof is held by CS Pharma. The exercise price of the warrant is the lower of 70% of the price sold in an equity financing of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, or $1.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The warrant will expire upon the earlier of December 31, 2020 or a qualified initial public offering of Rafael Pharmaceuticals or liquidation event of Rafael Pharmaceuticals. 
 
The 50% of CS Pharma not held by IDT-Rafael Holdings are held by investors who purchased that interest for $10 million in the aggregate. CS Pharma holds $10 million of cash that is expected to be invested in Rafael Pharmaceuticals.  The 10% of IDT-Rafael Holdings that we do not own is owned by Howard S. Jonas.

In addition, IDT-Rafael Holdings had the contractual right to receive additional shares of Rafael Pharmaceuticals representing 10% of the outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals that will be issued upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Food and Drug Administration approval of a Rafael Pharmaceuticals drug application, (ii) an initial public offering of Rafael Pharmaceuticals at a valuation of over $500 million, or (iii) a sale of Rafael Pharmaceuticals above certain valuations. Currently, none of the conditions have been satisfied and the right remains contingent. On September 14, 2017, IDT-Rafael Holdings distributed this right to its members on a pro-rata basis such that we received the right to 9% of the outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals and Mr. Jonas received the right to 1% of the outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals. In addition, as compensation for assuming the role of Chairman of the Board of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, and to create additional incentive to contribute to the success of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, on September 19, 2017, we transferred our right to receive 9% of the outstanding capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals to Mr. Jonas. The right is further transferable at the discretion of Mr. Jonas.
 
In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we used cash of $1.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for investments in Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a development-stage, privately held Israeli company focused on the development of an innovative, safe and effective cancer therapy based on liposome delivery. We own 38.9% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Lipomedix. We have the option to invest an additional $0.9 million in Lipomedix, which would increase our aggregate ownership to 50.6% of the issued share capital on a fully diluted basis. The option expires on the earlier of (1) a merger or acquisition transaction, (2) an initial public offering, or (3) November 30, 2017.
 
Throughout fiscal 2017, we prepared to spin off non-core assets including our interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals and Lipomedix as well as our real estate holdings to our shareholders as Rafael Holdings, Inc. In addition, we intend to contribute $50 million to $60 million in cash to Rafael Holdings, Inc. prior to the spin-off.
 
On June 1, 2016, we completed the Zedge Spin-Off, which was a pro rata distribution of the common stock that we held in our subsidiary Zedge to our stockholders. At the time of its spin-off, Zedge’s principal business consisted of providing one of the most popular content platforms for mobile device personalization including ringtones, wallpapers, home screen icons and notification sounds. Prior to its sale in October 2014, Fabrix was also included in All Other. Fabrix is a software development company offering a cloud-based scale-out storage and computing platform optimized for big data, virtualization and media storage, processing and delivery. The final sale price for 100% of the shares in Fabrix was $95 million in cash, excluding transaction costs and working capital and other adjustments. We owned approximately 78% of Fabrix on a fully diluted basis. Our share of the sale price was $69.2 million, after reflecting the impact of working capital and other adjustments. We recorded gain on the sale of our interest in Fabrix of $76.9 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
 
COMPETITION
 
IDT Telecom
 
Telecom Platform Services
 
Retail Communications
 Like all international calling services, our Boss Revolution PIN-less service is subject to fierce competition, and we do not expect to continue to grow revenues and margins without a successful strategy and sound execution. While virtually any company offering communication services is a competitor of our Retail Communications offerings, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators (or MVNOs) with aggressive international rate plans, and VoIP and other “over the top” (OTT) service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large foreign state-owned or state sanctioned telephone companies.
 
In our view, our ability to compete successfully against these operators depends on several factors. Our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high quality services. Our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign-born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash. Our Boss Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing. Finally, we also offer synergistic payment services over the Boss Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. In our view, these factors represent competitive advantages.
 
However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition, and can provide comparable service levels and pricing through established brands. Consequently, our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, expand our distribution and retail networks, improve our ability to reach and sell to customers through mobile devices, develop successful new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to build the brand equity of Boss Revolution.

Wholesale Carrier Services
 The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price, products and quality of service.
 
In our Wholesale Carrier Services business, we participate in a global market place with:
 

■ | interexchange carriers and other long-distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T Mobile, AT&T and Verizon; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, France Telecom and KDDI; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | OTT internet telephony providers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other VoIP providers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other providers of international long-distance services; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Wholesale Carrier Services business derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors: our Retail Communications business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, tradable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; the proprietary technologies powering our wholesale platform and in particular, the software that drives voice over internet protocols enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; our professional and experienced account management; and our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. In aggregate, these factors provide us with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes.
 
Payment Services
 The major competitors to Payment Services’ offerings include:
 

■ | international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that directly compete with our international airtime top-up; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other distributors, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our international airtime top-up offerings or aggressively discount their product offerings that are like our international airtime top-up offerings; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | traditional international money transfer services such as Western Union and MoneyGram that target foreign born communities in the United States, as well as new entrants trying to disrupt the money transfer market such as Xoom.com, Transferwise and World Remit. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS)
 Some of the major competitors to our UCaaS offerings include other UCaaS and or hosted voice providers such as Vonage Business, Nextiva, 8x8, West Corp, and Ring Central. Due to their longevity and substantial investments in the space, these providers offer a more advanced product set that includes features such as video, chat, collaboration, and analytics. These competitors, in addition to possessing more widely recognized brands, also support integration of their services with other well-known, third-party customer relationship management, or CRM, vendors such as SalesForce and SugarCRM as well as with various Google applications.
 
Consumer Phone Services
 The U.S. consumer phone services industry is characterized by intense competition, with numerous providers competing for a declining number of wireline customers, leading to a high churn rate because customers frequently change providers in response to offers of lower rates or promotional incentives.
 
The regional bell operating companies, or RBOCs, remain our primary competitors in the local exchange market. We are also competing with providers offering communications service over broadband connections using VoIP technology, such as cable companies and independent VoIP providers. Companies also provide voice telephony services over broadband Internet connections, allowing users of these Internet services, such as Vonage and Skype, to obtain communications services without subscribing to a conventional telephone line. Mobile wireless companies are deploying wireless technology as a substitute for traditional wireline local telephones.
 
Due to changes in the U.S. regulatory environment that affected our cost of provisioning bundled local/long distance phone services and increased competition, we ceased marketing activities for this service, and as a result, our Consumer Phone Services business has declined significantly.

REGULATION
 The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state and local laws, regulations, orders and legislation that are likely to materially affect us.
 
Regulation of Telecom in the United States
 Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The FCC has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges
 In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary net2phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
Interconnection and Unbundled Network Elements
 FCC rule changes relating to unbundling have resulted in increased costs to purchase services and increased uncertainty regarding the financial viability of providing service using unbundled network elements. As a result, starting in 2006, we placed our Consumer Phone Services business in “harvest mode,” wherein we seek to retain existing customers but do not actively market to new customers.
 
We continue to negotiate interconnection arrangements with Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, or ILECs, generally on a state-by-state basis, for our Consumer Phone Services business as well as other businesses. These agreements typically have terms of two or three years and need to be periodically renewed and renegotiated. While current FCC rules and regulations require the incumbent provider to provide certain network elements necessary for us to provision end-user services on an individual and combined basis, we cannot assure that the ILECs will provide these components in a manner and at a price that will support competitive operations.
 
Access Charges
 As a provider of long distance services, we remit access fees directly to local exchange carriers or indirectly to our underlying long-distance carriers for the origination and termination of our long-distance telecommunications traffic. Generally, intrastate access charges are higher than interstate access charges. Therefore, to the degree access charges increase or a greater percentage of our long-distance traffic becomes intrastate, our costs of providing long distance services will increase. Similarly, as a local exchange provider, we bill access charges to long distance providers for the termination of those providers’ long-distance calls. Accordingly, as opposed to our long-distance business, our local exchange business benefits from the receipt of intrastate and interstate long distance traffic. Under FCC rules, our interstate access rates must be set at levels no higher than those of the ILEC in each area we serve, which limits our ability to seek increased revenue from these services. Some, but not all, states have similar restrictions on our intrastate access charges.

13

For nearly a decade, the FCC has had open regulatory proceedings in which it has considered reforming “intercarrier compensation,” which is a term that covers the payments that carriers bill and remit to each other-access charges and reciprocal compensation, generally-for the use of telecommunications networks to originate and terminate phone calls. On November 18, 2011, the FCC released a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking wherein it set forth a schedule which, over a period of several years, substantially reduces terminating access rates. Since we both make payments to and receive payments from other carriers for terminating long distance calls, the FCC’s action has the effect of reducing payments we receive from other carriers while also reducing our costs to terminate our long-distance calls. The FCC has also raised the possibility - which it has yet to conclusively act upon - that it will reduce originating access charges in a similar manner. Due to the nature of IDT’s business, IDT pays, but does not bill originating access charges. At this time we cannot predict the effect future FCC actions may have upon our business.
 
Customer Proprietary Network Information
 In 2007, the FCC increased its regulatory oversight of Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI. The FCC took this increased role in response to several high-profile cases of “pretexting,” which occurs when an individual secures from a communications provider, through deception, the private phone records of another person. We have a CPNI compliance policy in place and we believe we currently meet or exceed all FCC requirements for the protection of CPNI. However, we cannot be assured that we are in full compliance and if the FCC were to conclude that we were not in compliance, we could be subject to fines or other forms of sanction.
Straight Path Spectrum LLC
 On September 20, 2016, we received a letter of inquiry from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC requesting certain information and materials related to an investigation of potential violations by Straight Path Spectrum LLC (formerly a subsidiary of ours and currently a subsidiary of Straight Path) in connection with licenses to operate on the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands of the Fixed Microwave Services. As disclosed in Straight Path’s filings with the SEC, Straight Path entered into a consent decree with the FCC that terminated the FCC’s related investigation against Straight Path. We have cooperated with the FCC in this matter and have responded to the letter of inquiry. If the FCC were to pursue separate action against us, the FCC could seek to fine or impose regulatory penalties or civil liability on us related to activities during the period of ownership by us.
Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions
 Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s public utility commission. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services, but permits state public utility commissions to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long-distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business.
 
Regulation of Telecom—International
 In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries. We have obtained licenses or authorizations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In numerous countries where we operate or plan to operate, we are subject to many local laws and regulations that, among other things, may restrict or limit the ability of telecommunications companies to provide telecommunications services in competition with state-owned or state-sanctioned dominant carriers.
 
Regulation of Internet Telephony
 The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, IDT is able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services.

Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations
 Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded (also called “open loop”) prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including:

■ | Banking laws and regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Anti-money laundering laws; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Privacy and data security laws and regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Consumer protection laws and regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Unclaimed property laws; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Card association and network organization rules. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with the development of our money transmission services and the expansion of our network branded prepaid card offerings, we have actively pursued our own money transmitter licenses. At July 31, 2017, we had received a money transmitter license in 47 of the 49 U.S. states that require such a license, as well as in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.
 
Regulation of Other Businesses
 We operate other smaller or early-stage initiatives and operations, which may be subject to federal, state, local or foreign law and regulation.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain name registrations and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand names. All of our employees sign confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that the employee may not use or disclose our confidential information except as expressly permitted in connection with the performance of his or her duties for us, or in other limited circumstances. These agreements also state that, to the extent rights in any invention conceived by the employee while employed by us do not vest in us automatically by operation of law, the employee is required to assign his or her rights to us.
 
We own approximately 100 trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications in the United States and at least 360 registrations and pending applications abroad. We protect our brands in the marketplace including the IDT, Boss Revolution and net2phone brands. Where deemed appropriate, we have filed trademark applications throughout the world in an effort to protect our trademarks. Where deemed appropriate, we have also filed patent applications in an effort to protect our patentable intellectual property. IDT Corporation owns 11 issued patents and 3 patent applications in the United States and 14 patents issued abroad with 4 patent applications pending abroad.
 
We maintain a global telecommunications switching and transmission infrastructure that enables us to provide an array of telecommunications, Internet access and Internet telephony services to our customers worldwide. We have domestic and foreign patents and patent applications regarding our infrastructure and/or global telecommunication network for our international telecommunications traffic and the international traffic of other telecommunications companies.
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
Companies in the telecommunications industry and other industries in which we compete own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Although we do not believe that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use.
