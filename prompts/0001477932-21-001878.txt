DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Our Corporate History and Background 
 
The Company was incorporated on July 5, 2016, under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
On June 26, 2020, Milena Topolac Tomovic, the then major shareholder, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hak Yiu Ng, wherein Milena Topolac Tomovic sold 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, then representing approximately 78.9% of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock, to Mr. Ng.
 
Milena Topolac Tomovic served as President, Secretary, Treasurer and a director from July 5, 2016 until her resignation on July 6, 2020. Effective from July 6, 2020, Milena Topolac Tomovic resigned as a director, and from the offices of President, Secretary and Treasurer of, the Company. Immediately prior to such resignation, Ms. Topolac Tomovic, as the sole member of the board of directors at such time, appointed Hak Yiu Ng as a director, and as President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Ng was the Company’s sole officer and director until November 25, 2020.
 
On November 25, 2020, Hak Yiu Ng resigned as Secretary and was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. On November 25, 2020, Huang Zhen Kun was appointed Chief Executive Officer and a Director; Lau Kit Yan, Mark was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and a Director; Poon To Ming was appointed Chief Operating Officer; Wong Ka Hing Andrew was appointed Chief Marketing Officer; and Xu Ming was appointed Chief Technology Officer.
 
The Company does not have any current plans, arrangements, discussions or intentions, whether written or oral, to engage in a merger or acquisition with an identified or unidentified company or person to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.
 
From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of Powertech Holdings, the principal business of the Company was a plan to establish a business to lease and sell certain items or means of what we referred to as eco-transport. These items are commonly known under the names: a Segway, a gyro-scooter or a self-balanced two-wheeled scooter, a self-balanced mono-wheeled scooter and a two-wheeled hoverboard. We expected our products and services to be demanded by establishments or enterprises or events, for instance, conferences held in large facilities, or touristic agencies and other establishments or organizations that face the problem of covering large distances by employees or visitors of theirs.

Renewable Energy Segment in Hong Kong
 
Hong Kong is one of the most densely-populated regions in the world. According to the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government, the population of Hong Kong is estimated to be 7.52 million in mid-2019. The large population results in a serious energy demand in modern life.
 
Renewable energy (“RE”) is one of practical and affordable solutions to the energy needs in Hong Kong. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables could supply 80% of the world’s electricity by 2050. Although Hong Kong does not have favorable conditions for large-scale commercialized RE power generation, the government has applied RE on a wider and large scale by 2030 as according to the Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan. Based on the currently mature and commercially available technologies, Hong Kong has about 3-4% of realizable RE potential arising from solar energy. The Hong Kong government spearhead to apply RE in a systematic manner, issue its environmental policy by specifying all new government buildings to have at least 10% rooftop space to install solar power system, while set up a strong budget to do retrofit work for all existing government and public buildings to install rooftop solar power system.

The Paris Agreement an ambitious multilateral treaty agreed in December 2015, succeeds the Kyoto Protocol that will expire in 2020. Hong Kong formally signed it on Earth Day, 22 April 2016, and the Paris Agreement came into force on 4th November 2016.
 
The key provisions of the Paris Agreement call for global actions to - achieve “peak” greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between carbon sources and sinks in the second half of the 21st century (i.e. to reach “carbon neutrality” between 2051 and 2100); and, keep global average temperature increase well below 2 degree relative to pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degree
 
To meet the requirement of the Paris Agreement, Hong Kong has set an ambitious carbon intensity target of 65% to 70% by 2030 using 2005 as the base, which is equivalent to 26% to 36% absolute reduction and a reduction to 3.3-3.8 tonnes on a per capita basis.

6. Tracker-run Solar Greenhouse (patent pending)
 
Solar greenhouse with solar tracker, where a computer programmed motor run tracking mechanism is built in to the rooftop structure, whereas the solar panels rotates according to the sun’s track, maintaining always 90 degree angle facing the sun, maximizing solar irradiation harvest which results in much higher solar power yield than conventional mounting structure. Power output is 15% higher than fixed tilt structural greenhouse. The motor is programmed in such a manner that, during typhoon day, it turns flat to avoid wind load, while when it rains, it rotates continuous to do auto-cleaning of the solar panels.
 
This product is denoted by the following features:
 

· | The optimum tracking angle is calculated using highly precise astronomical equations based on time, longitude and latitude information from a GPS sensor; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The current tilt angle is obtained from a sensor (e.g. an inclinometer); and 
· | By coordinating the two angles, the control system instructs the tracking mounting system to follow the sun throughout the day, which increases the total amount of electrical energy produced.

Link is committed to build in all the shopping malls rooftop solar power system. And so far, Powertech have completed 3 projects for LINK.
 
Our Business model and Business Strategy:
 
EPC (Engineer, Procurement and Construction): For government and for pseudo-government organisations, and some of the industrial clients who owns industrial and commercial builders, we offer one stop solution of EPC services, whereas we design, engineer, procure, and install solar power system for the clients on BOT basis. Our business strategy for these group of clients is to offer full set of value added service, not only doing solar power system installation, but also service like water-proof works, building repairing works. This distinguished us from our competitors that, we carry out waterproof work on the Premises before installing the System by laying over an aluminium foil waterproof asphalt self-adhesive membrane (asphalt base/butyl/ rubber group) to the entire roof of each of the Buildings up to 300mm of the parapet wall. The asphalt self adhesive membrane stop water leakage problem and at the same time act as reflective layer for solar irradiation to back sides of bi-facial solar panels, which result in higher solar yield. We tailor made all solar mounting system of each project to meet the stringent demand of the legal wind code, making third party wind tunnel test to make sure the system is safe and durable.
 
Since the fourth quarter of 2020, we have developed and built the solar plant system and generated some income from the sale of the electricity under the government program.
