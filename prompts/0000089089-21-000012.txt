Item 1. Business
General
We are North America’s largest provider of deathcare products and services, with a network of funeral service locations and cemeteries unequaled in geographic scale. At December 31, 2020, we operated 1,470 funeral service locations and 483 cemeteries (including 297 funeral service/cemetery combination locations), which are geographically diversified across 44 states, eight Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
We are well known for our Dignity Memorial® brand, North America's first transcontinental brand of deathcare products and services. Our other brands include Dignity Planning™, National Cremation Society®, Advantage® Funeral and Cremation Services, Funeraria del Angel™, Making Everlasting Memories®, Neptune Society™ and Trident Society™. Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral service/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and other related businesses, which enable us to serve a wide array of customer needs. We sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need and on a preneed basis.
History
We were incorporated in Texas in July of 1962. Our original business plan was based on efficiencies of scale, specifically reducing overhead costs by sharing resources such as preparation services, back office administration support, transportation, and personnel among funeral service locations in a business “cluster.” After proving the plan’s effectiveness in Houston in the early 1960s, we set out to apply this operating strategy through the acquisition of deathcare businesses in other markets over the next three decades. Beginning in 1993, we expanded beyond North America, acquiring major deathcare companies in Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, plus smaller holdings in other European countries, Asia and South America.
During the mid to late 1990s, acquisitions of deathcare facilities became extremely competitive, resulting in increased prices for acquisitions and substantially reduced returns on invested capital. In 1999, we significantly reduced our level of acquisition activity and over the next several years implemented various initiatives to pay down debt, increase cash flow, reduce overhead costs, increase efficiency, and leverage our scale. We divested our international businesses and many North American funeral service locations and cemeteries that were either underperforming or did not fit within our long-term strategy. At the same time, we began to capitalize on the strength of our network by introducing to North America the first transcontinental brand of deathcare services and products — Dignity Memorial® (see www.dignitymemorial.com). Information contained on our website is not part of this report.
In late 2006, having arrived at a position of financial stability and improved operating efficiency, we acquired the then second largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Alderwoods Group. In early 2010, we acquired the then fifth largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Keystone North America. In June of 2011, we acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of The Neptune Society, Inc. (Neptune), which is the nation's largest direct cremation organization, now known as SCI Direct. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2014, we acquired the remaining 30% of the outstanding shares of Neptune. In December 2013, we purchased Stewart Enterprises, Inc. (Stewart), the then second largest operator of funeral service locations and cemeteries in North America. We continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and complete divestitures of non-strategic funeral homes and cemeteries, some of which can be meaningful.
Funeral and Cemetery Operations
Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral service/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and other related businesses. See Note 13 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas.
We have the largest number of combination locations in North America. Funeral service/cemetery combination locations are businesses in which a funeral service location is physically located within or adjoining a cemetery that we own. Combination locations allow certain facility, personnel, and equipment costs to be shared between the funeral service location and cemetery locations. Such combination facilities typically can be more cost competitive and have higher gross margins than funeral and

PART I

cemetery operations that are operated separately. Combination locations also create synergies between funeral and cemetery preneed sales force personnel and give families added convenience to purchase both funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at a single location. 
Funeral service locations provide all professional services related to funerals and cremations, including the use of funeral home facilities and motor vehicles, arranging and directing services, removal, preparation, embalming, cremations, memorialization, and catering. Funeral merchandise, including burial caskets and related accessories, urns and other cremation receptacles, outer burial containers, flowers, online and video tributes, stationery products, casket and cremation memorialization products, travel protection, and other ancillary merchandise, is sold at funeral service locations.
Our cemeteries provide cemetery property interment rights, including developed lots, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces, niches, and other cremation memorialization and interment options. Cemetery merchandise and services, including memorial markers and bases, outer burial containers, flowers and floral placement, other ancillary merchandise, graveside services, merchandise installation, and interments, are sold at our cemeteries. 
We also sell cemetery property interment rights and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services whereby a customer contractually agrees to the terms of certain products and services to be delivered and performed in the future. We define these sales as preneed sales. As a result of such preneed sales, our preneed backlog of unfulfilled funeral and cemetery contracts was $12.7 billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table at December 31, 2020 provides the number of our funeral service locations and cemeteries by country, and by state, territory, or province:

We believe we have satisfactory title to the properties owned and used in our business, subject to various liens, encumbrances, and easements that are incidental to ownership rights and uses and do not materially detract from the value of the property. At December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 90% of the real estate and buildings used at our facilities, and the remainder of the facilities were leased under both finance and operating leases. At December 31, 2020, our 483 cemeteries contained a total of approximately 35,500 acres, of which approximately 66% was developed.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 1929 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77019. The property consists of approximately 160,000 square feet of office space and 185,000 square feet of parking space on approximately seven acres. We also lease approximately 35,000 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which we utilize for corporate activities. We own a building in Jefferson, Louisiana with approximately 96,200 square feet of office space that we use, in part, for corporate activities

COVID-19 Impact
During 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) spread worldwide and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 poses a threat to the health and economic well-being of our employees, customers, communities, and vendors. Our dedicated associates are acting as first responders and providing essential services for our client families and communities. The operation of all our facilities is critically dependent on our employees who operate these locations. To ensure the well-being of all our employees and their families, we provided them with detailed health and safety literature on COVID-19, such as the Center for Disease Control (the “CDC”)’s industry-specific guidelines for working with the deceased who were, and may have been, infected with COVID-19. In addition, we provide personal protection equipment to those employees whose positions require such equipment. We continue adding measures to help ensure client families can safely visit our facilities and celebrate the life of their loved ones. We have implemented work from home policies at our corporate offices consistent with CDC and local government guidance to reduce the risks of exposure to COVID-19, while continuing to support our locations and the customers they serve. 
Like most businesses world-wide, COVID-19 has impacted various aspects of our business operations. Until the onset of COVID-19, sales growth was continuing to trend in-line and consistent with our forecast for the first quarter of 2020. However, during the last two weeks of the first quarter of 2020, we saw our preneed sales activity and our atneed sales averages precipitously decline as North Americans began to practice social distancing to comply with multiple state and provincial shelter-in-place orders. Since that time, we have experienced periodic increases in services performed in COVID-19 hot spots with accompanying declines in atneed sales averages due to social distancing restrictions.
The rigorous restrictions placed on gatherings, mandated by state, provincial, and local governments posed a unique challenge for our locations. In mid-March, we quickly implemented technology solutions to allow extended family and friends to virtually participate in the ceremony alongside the immediate family. We also carefully designed outdoor venues to allow guests to be present, while remaining at a safe distance. We also have offered customers the ability to livestream services with the use of Facebook Live and to broadcast cemetery services through radio transmitters at certain locations. Atneed funeral directors are also using virtual meeting platforms to discuss and plan service details with client families. Our preneed sales teams continue overcoming social distancing obstacles in certain areas of the country by leveraging technology with customers who may prefer to purchase cemetery property and merchandise from the safety of their home or setting up outdoor pop-up canopies to discuss pre-planning from a safe distance. 
While we implemented creative solutions to meet our client families' needs, we are still periodically experiencing a negative impact to our sales averages due to the continued social distancing impacts across North America. Nevertheless, we continued to experience unprecedented growth in our preneed cemetery sales while continuing to experience an increase in services and burials performed.
As the world continues to experience the fluctuating effects of COVID-19, we remain reliant on the values and capabilities of our organization to meet the needs of our client families while ensuring our associates and customers are safe. The continued 
 Service Corporation International


PART I

demand for services is further evidence that a considerable number of our customers continue to value what our team does best, which is helping our client families gain closure and healing through the process of grieving, remembrance, and celebration. The health, safety, and mental well-being of our associates continues to be a top priority throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been able to avoid layoffs, mandatory furloughs, and any widespread reductions in pay as a result of the impact of COVID-19, while also providing certain associates with bonuses to recognize their incredible efforts and an Employee Assistance Program, which provides access to licensed counseling. 
Competition
Although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries, the majority of deathcare businesses in North America are locally-owned, independent operations. We estimate that our funeral and cemetery market share in North America is approximately 15%-16% based on estimated total industry revenue. The success of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name, reputation, and location of that funeral service location or cemetery. Competitive pricing, professional service and attention, and well-maintained locations are also important.
We have an unparalleled network of funeral service locations and cemeteries that offers high quality products and services at prices that are competitive with local competing funeral service locations, cemeteries, and retail locations. Within this network, the funeral service locations and cemeteries operate under various names as most operations were acquired as existing businesses. We have co-branded the majority of our operations under the name Dignity Memorial®. Our branding strategy gives us a strategic advantage and identity in the industry. While this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries, the original names associated with acquired operations, and their inherent goodwill and heritage, generally remain the same. For example, Geo. H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Directors is now Geo. H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Directors, a Dignity Memorial® provider.
Strategies for Growth
We are the largest consolidated deathcare company in North America and are well positioned for long-term profitable growth. Like most businesses world-wide, COVID-19 has impacted various aspects of our business operations, however, we believe our fundamental strategy has not changed. Over the next several years, our industry will be largely shaped by the aging of the Baby Boomer generation in the deathcare space and we are poised to benefit from the aging of this North American population. In each stage of life, Baby Boomers have set new trends, transformed society, and redefined norms, and we anticipate the impact will be the same for our industry. We have already begun to see the impact of the Baby Boomers through the growth in our preneed cemetery sales program. We expect seeing a similar impact on our preneed funeral results and ultimately our atneed results as these preneed contracts mature. In every aspect of our business, we are listening and responding to our customer’s changing needs and leveraging our scale to deliver unparalleled experiences - both digitally and in person - to meet those changing needs.
The following strategies remain the core of our foundation: 1) grow revenue, 2) leverage our unparalleled scale, and 3) deploy capital. While these strategies remain unchanged, through the pandemic a shift to a higher use of technology has influenced how we serve our customers and how we invest our capital.
Grow Revenue
We plan to grow revenue by remaining relevant to our customers as their preferences evolve through a combination of price, product, and service differentiation strategies. We also expect that growing our preneed sales will drive future revenue growth.
Remaining Relevant to the Customer
Remaining relevant to our customer is key to generating revenue growth in a changing customer environment. We are constantly evolving to meet the varying preferences and needs of our customers. Whether choosing burial or cremation, the Baby Boomers are redefining the traditional funeral by transitioning away from solemnly mourning a death to a personalized celebration of life ceremony. In certain markets, we are responding to this trend by spending capital to repurpose traditional casket selection rooms to event rooms designed for a celebration. We are offering a customer friendly digital presentation of options that allow the customer to choose merchandise and services including unique celebration, catering, and celebrant services.
In our funeral business, we focus on memorialization merchandise and services that are meaningful to both our burial and cremation customers. The growing trend of cremation requires more flexibility in providing products and services. We have developed cremation service packages, which may or may not include a celebratory memorialization.
In our cemetery business, we continue to grow revenue by responding to the customer’s desire for personalized and unique options by expanding our tiered product and cemetery property options. Over the past several years, we have substantially increased our property options to offer many unique choices. From high-end family estates, which capture incredible views, to nicely landscaped hedge estates, we continue to develop property selections that resonate with our customers. For cemetery 
FORM 10-K 


PART I

merchandise and services, we have developed innovative products such as recurring floral placements, customized cemetery property offerings, and specialized graveside service options. We continue to embrace cremation opportunities for customers in our cemetery segment by offering an increased variety of cremation property options, including niches and scattering gardens. 
As we evolve to meet ever-changing customer preferences, we will continue catering to the religious, ethnic, and cultural traditions important to many of our customers. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained flexible to meet the varying needs of customers due to social distancing restrictions placed on our locations across North America. This flexibility has strengthened our resolve to remain relevant to changing customer preferences.
Growing Preneed Sales
Our preneed sales program drives current and future revenue growth. Baby Boomers have been impacting our cemetery preneed sales for several years and are beginning to positively impact the growth of our preneed funeral sales programs. Our sales organization is supported by a highly trained sales force of approximately 3,750 counselors, who provide customers informed guidance about various service and merchandise options tailored for today’s consumers. Utilizing our scale, our counselors are reaching out to consumers through multiple lead channels, driving future revenue growth. We sponsor community events and seminars to educate and provide guidance around preplanning both funeral and cemetery services and merchandise. In 2019, we adopted a more sophisticated direct mail approach and we continue increasing our digital presence through search engine optimization and other marketing channels. We have a unique competitive advantage to continue growing preneed sales benefiting from our size and scale. Our preneed program provides us with an opportunity to develop greater brand awareness, gives consumers peace of mind about their end of life arrangements, and secures future market share. Many of our lead channels shifted away from in person throughout 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we gained efficiencies from generating leads digitally as a result of our website and search engine optimization efforts and leveraged video conferencing for socially distanced interactions with many customers.
Leverage Our Unparalleled Scale
As the largest deathcare company in North America, we leverage our scale by developing our sales organization and optimizing the use of our network using technology and for the benefit of our preneed backlog. Our scale enables cost efficiencies through purchasing power and utilizing economies of scale through our supply chain channel. In 2020 throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to continue to operate without any major disruptions to our business, which highlights the power of our scale.
Developing Our Sales Organization
Over the last several years, we have continued to invest significantly in the development of our sales organization with best in class tools and technologies. These investments include a customer relationship management system, which drives improvements in productivity and sales production by leveraging data analytics, rigorous lead tracking, and effective follow up campaigns. We continue to diversify our sales force to understand and cater to the religious, ethnic, and cultural traditions important to our customers. Our premier combination locations and other large and recognizable cemeteries and funeral homes attract high-quality sales talent. Our scale allows us to operate and expand our sales organization in a manner that our competitors cannot replicate. During 2020, we were able to train and quickly develop our sales organization to be able to efficiently complete digital sales with the use of various online tools.
Optimizing Our Network and Deploying Customer-Facing Technology
We continue driving operating discipline and leveraging our scale through standardizing processes and capitalizing on new technologies improving the customer experience. Our advancements in technology are changing the way we present our product and service offerings to customers. Our atneed point of sale system, HMIS+, uses a digital platform enabled with high resolution video and photographs to create a seamless presentation of our products and service offerings. Our recently implemented and mobile preneed sales system, provides customers with a full digital presentation experience in their home or other place of their choosing. 
In 2018, we completed a redesign of almost 2,000 Dignity Memorial® location websites. Featuring a modern and user-friendly design, these location-specific websites have been designed for mobile use and optimized for better search engine ranking. In addition to the contemporary and sophisticated design, client families now enjoy new features such as a streamlined obituary completion process, social media sharing capabilities, and the ability to create and share personalized content in memory of their loved one. In 2020, our websites grew significantly in number of visits, which reached over 160 million visits.
During 2019, we took significant steps improving the quality of customer feedback and elevating our online reputation. We engaged a third party to increase the response rate from customers for online reviews and we have seen a significant increase in the number of reviews over the past two years. Online reviews provide visibility of customer engagement down to the location level and shorten our response time in addressing customer concerns. We collaborated with a leading technology partner to deliver the J.D. Power surveys digitally, which has increased the quantity and quality of customer feedback and reduced the time it takes to receive customer feedback. We have established a social media presence for a number of our funeral and cemetery businesses, including the ability to livestream services at over 1,000 locations. These digital efforts resulted in favorable customer satisfaction ratings and increased digital sales leads.
 Service Corporation International


PART I

Although 2020 was difficult in many unexpected ways, we learned valuable lessons around our ability to quickly deploy customer-facing technology. Our associates and client families embraced an increasingly digital world and we utilized various online tools to complete sales and meet families while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are encouraged by the increased digitization and we are making great strides with internal projects leveraging technology and simplifying nearly every facet of service delivery.
Growing Our Preneed Backlog
Our preneed backlog, which includes both insurance and trust-funded merchandise and service products, allows us the opportunity to grow future revenue in a more stable and efficient manner than selling at the time of need. The scale of our multi-billion dollar trust portfolios allows us to leverage access to preeminent money managers with favorable fee structures generating above average returns. Our blended funding approach between insurance and trust-funded merchandise and service products allows us to combine the positive cash flow and predictability of the insurance product with the potential upside of higher returns from our trusted merchandise and service products. This blended approach also results in our ability to grow our preneed backlog in a cash flow neutral manner. Additionally, we are experiencing contracts coming out of the backlog today to be serviced with growth rates that are superior to inflationary atneed pricing due to market performance.
Deploy Capital
We continue maximizing capital deployment opportunities in a disciplined and balanced manner to the highest relative return. Our strong liquidity, favorable debt maturity profile, and robust cash flow generation enables us to continue our long-standing commitment to use capital deployment to opportunistically grow our business and enhance shareholder value, even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our priorities for capital deployment remain: 1) investing in acquisitions and building new funeral service locations, 2) paying dividends, 3) repurchasing shares, and 4) managing debt. During 2020, we were able to weather the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and strategically deploy capital to the highest relative return opportunities. 
Investing in Acquisitions and Building New Funeral Service Locations
We manage our footprint by focusing on strategic acquisitions and building new funeral service locations where the expected returns are attractive and meaningfully exceed our weighted average cost of capital. We target businesses with favorable customer dynamics and locations where we can achieve additional economies of scale. Over the last several years, we have increased our growth capital spend on new funeral service locations growing our footprint into new communities as well as expanding of existing locations to remain relevant to our customers. For our cemetery businesses, we plan to pursue strategic acquisitions to create more opportunities to serve Baby Boomers through our tiered cemetery options. Additionally, we acquire land that will be developed for future cemetery use in some of our largest markets. This investment in our future will allow us to continue creating cemetery offerings that appeal to varying preferences in those markets for many years to come. 
Paying Dividends
Our quarterly dividend rate has steadily grown from $0.025 per common share in 2005 to $0.21 per common share at the end of 2020. We target a payout ratio of 30% to 40% of after-tax earnings excluding special items and intend to grow our cash dividend commensurate with the growth in our business. 
Repurchasing Shares
Absent opportunities for strategic acquisitions, we expect to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, debt covenants, and normal trading restrictions. The volume and timing of our purchases is determined as we evaluate the opportunity to capture value for our shareholders. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of our shares outstanding by 29%. In August 2020, our Board of Directors increased our repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. The remaining dollar value of shares authorized to be purchased under the share repurchase program was $231.0 million at December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repurchased 802,146 shares for $40.7 million at an average cost per share of $50.74.
Managing Debt
We continue to focus on maintaining optimal levels of liquidity and financial flexibility. Our flexible capital strategy allows us to manage our debt maturity profile by making open market debt repurchases when it is opportunistic to do so. We generate a relatively consistent annual cash flow stream that is generally resistant to down economic cycles. This cash flow stream and our significant liquidity allow us to substantially reduce our long-term debt maturities should we choose to do so.

Information contained on our website is not part of this report. The SEC also maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. 
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2020, we employed 16,503 individuals on a full-time basis and 7,632 individuals on a part-time basis. Of the full-time associates, 14,231 were employed in the funeral and cemetery operations and 2,272 were employed in corporate or other overhead areas of our business. Approximately 2.5% of our associates are represented by unions. Although labor disputes occur from time to time, relations with associates are generally considered favorable. We reach out to our associates for feedback throughout their employment at SCI using a variety of voluntary surveys ensuring we are meeting the needs and expectations of our large and diverse workforce.
Associate Benefits
All eligible associates in the United States may elect coverage under our group health and life insurance plans. Associates covered by a collective bargaining agreement are typically covered by union health plans and, therefore, do not participate in our health insurance plan. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 9,620 and 9,528 associates, respectively, who had elected to participate in our group health insurance plans. 
Eligible associates in the United States are covered by retirement plans of SCI or various subsidiaries, while international associates are covered by other SCI (or SCI subsidiary) defined contribution or government-mandated benefit plans. We have an employee savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for the exclusive benefit of our United States employees. We contribute a matching contribution based on the employee's contribution and years of vesting service. For more information about our retirement plans, see Note 12 of Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We understand the importance of work-life balance and provide other benefits such as baby bonding time, paid time off, and financial planning support for our associates. Additionally, we offer an employee assistance program that offers 24/7 masters-level counseling services for associates who may be facing challenges outside of the workplace.
Inclusion and Diversity
We believe in the power of inclusion and respecting our fellow associates’ work, ideas, beliefs, and lifestyles. Our Inclusion and Diversity Committee, which is a cross-functional team of associates, has been key to the development of programs such as our Women’s Leadership Conference and Associate Resource Communities (ARCs). The ARCs allow colleagues with similar interests to connect for networking, provide opportunities for growth, and support the communities and customers we serve. Our leadership team is committed to advancing inclusion and diversity within the workplace, by embracing the many backgrounds and perspectives that make each of us so unique, allowing us to remain relevant to the families we serve.
Training and Development
We provide opportunities for career growth, as we believe supporting the personal and professional goals of our associates is a priority for us. In addition to development programs and a robust online training portal offering more than 2,000 courses, associates can participate in mentoring programs and take advantage of discounts and tuition reimbursement through our many university partnerships. We are also proud to offer scholarship and apprentice programs to those interested in joining our profession. 
Regulation
Our funeral operations are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under the FTC’s Trade Regulation Rule on Funeral Industry Practices (the “Funeral Rule”), which went into effect in 1984. The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral merchandise and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: 1) misrepresenting legal, crematory, and cemetery requirements; 2) embalming for a fee without permission; 3) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; and 4) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral merchandise or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral merchandise or services. 
 Service Corporation International


PART I

Our operations are also subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as Canadian provincial laws and regulations. For example, state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral service locations and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities. Our facilities are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations. We take various measures to comply with the Funeral Rule and all laws and regulations. For example, we have established and maintain policies and procedures around our business practices; we provide training of our personnel; and we perform ongoing reviews of our compliance efforts. We are currently in substantial compliance with the Funeral Rule and all laws and regulations. 
Federal, state, and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies (including Canadian legislative bodies and agencies) frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the deathcare industry in general. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us.
