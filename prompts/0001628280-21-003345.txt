ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, ocular surface diseases and retinal diseases. 
Our strategy is to successfully commercialize our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved glaucoma franchise products, Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (“Rhopressa®”) and Rocklatan® (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% (“Rocklatan®”) in the United States. Both Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® are being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to them through pharmacies across the United States. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® for the majority of lives covered under commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans. Our commercial team responsible for sales of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® is targeting eye-care professionals throughout the United States, and with the addition of a contract sales organization and a separate telesales team, we are able to reach over 16,000 eye-care professionals.
U.S. Commercial Products

Rhopressa® is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Rhopressa® is taken in the evening and has shown in preclinical and clinical trials to be effective in reducing IOP, with a favorable safety profile.The active ingredient in Rhopressa®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase (“ROCK”) inhibitor. Rhopressa® increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork (“TM”), which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the healthy eye and is the diseased tissue responsible for elevated IOP in glaucoma. Using this mechanism of action (“MOA”), we believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. 
Rocklatan® is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. Rocklatan® is also taken in the evening, and similar to Rhopressa®, has shown in preclinical and clinical trials to be effective in reducing IOP, with a favorable safety profile.Based on our clinical data, we believe that Rocklatan® has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any glaucoma medication currently marketed in the United States. We also believe that Rocklatan® competes with both prostaglandin analog (“PGA”) and non-PGA therapies and may over time become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.

Outside the United States
Our strategy also includes developing our business opportunities outside the United States, including successfully commercializing Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Europe and obtaining regulatory approval in Japan and other countries in Asia, and our globalization plan is well underway.
In Europe, Rhokiinsa® (marketed as Rhopressa® in the United States) was granted a Centralised Marketing Authorisation (“Centralised MA”) by the European Commission (“EC”) in November 2019. Further, Roclanda® (marketed as Rocklatan® in the United States) was granted a Centralised MA by the EC in January 2021, which followed the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) adopting a positive opinion recommending approval of the Marketing Authorisation Application (“MAA”) for Roclanda® in November 2020.
We reported positive interim topline 90-day efficacy data in September 2020 for our Phase 3b clinical trial for Roclanda®, named Mercury 3, which we believe is important to the execution of our strategy in Europe. As a result of the positive Mercury 3 results and the Roclanda® approval in Europe, third parties have expressed interest in a potential commercialization partnership in and potentially beyond Europe. We are currently engaged in discussions with potential partners.
In Japan, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Santen Agreement”) with Santen Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Santen”) in October 2020 to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Japan and eight other countries in Asia. We initiated a Rhopressa® Phase 3 clinical trial in December 2020, the first of three expected Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan. Clinical trials for Rocklatan® have not yet begun.
Glaucoma Product Manufacturing
We have a sterile fill production facility in Athlone, Ireland, for the production of our FDA approved products and clinical supplies with the goal of having the Athlone manufacturing plant supply our ophthalmic products in all markets for which we received regulatory approval and are commercialized. The Athlone manufacturing plant began manufacturing commercial supplies of Rocklatan® in the first quarter of 2020 and Rhopressa® in the third quarter of 2020 for distribution to the United States. Shipments of commercial supply of Rocklatan® and Rhopressa® from the Athlone manufacturing plant to the United States commenced in the third quarter of 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The Athlone manufacturing plant has also manufactured clinical supplies of Rhopressa® for the Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan. As the Athlone manufacturing plant commenced operations in 2020, it has not yet reached full capacity. We expect that the Athlone manufacturing plant will have adequate capacity to produce Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® for the United States as well as the European and Japanese commercial markets. We expect that in 2021 the Athlone manufacturing plant will manufacture most of our needs for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States. We may continue to use contract manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® for distribution in the United States, but at reduced levels compared to before the Athlone manufacturing plant was operational.
Product Candidates and Pipeline
Our strategy also includes enhancing our longer-term commercial potential by identifying and advancing additional product candidates through our internal discovery efforts, our entry into potential research collaborations or in-licensing arrangements or our acquisition of additional ophthalmic products, technologies or product candidates that complement our current product portfolio.
As discussed in “—Product Candidates and Pipeline Opportunities” below, AR-15512 is our product candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease, which we acquired from Avizorex Pharma S.L. (“Avizorex”) in late 2019, and for which we initiated a large Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2020. Furthermore, we are developing three sustained-release implants focused on retinal diseases, AR-1105, AR-13503 SR and AR-14034 SR. For AR-1105, we successfully completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (“RVO”) in July 2020, which indicates sustained efficacy of up to six months, an important achievement in validating the potential capabilities of Aerie’s sustained release platform. With respect to future plans for AR-1105, we are currently evaluating next steps regarding advancement into a Phase 3 clinical trial along with commercialization prospects in both Europe and the United States. For AR-13503 SR, we initiated a first in-human clinical safety study in the third quarter of 2019 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (age-related macular degeneration, “AMD”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”), which is currently ongoing. For preclinical AR-14034 SR, we anticipate filing an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in the second half of 2022 to evaluate its potential as a treatment for wet AMD and DME.
We discovered and developed the active ingredient in Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®, netarsudil, and AR-13503 internally through a rational drug design approach that coupled medicinal chemistry with high content screening of compounds in proprietary cell- based assays. We selected and formulated netarsudil for preclinical in vivo testing following a detailed characterization of over 3,000 synthesized ROCK inhibitors, a number that has since grown to approximately 4,000.
Intellectual Property Portfolio
We own the worldwide rights for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®. We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States and internationally through early 2034, and have filed for patent protection in the United States and internationally through 2037. In addition, through the acquisition of Avizorex, we are the exclusive licensee through 2031 of issued U.S. patents providing patent protection for pharmaceutical compositions comprising AR-15512 and methods of its use for ophthalmic uses. The Avizorex acquisition also enabled us to be the exclusive licensee of pending foreign counterparts to the issued U.S. patents regarding AR-15512. Should these foreign counterparts issue such patents, they will provide patent protection for pharmaceutical compositions in such jurisdictions comprising AR-15512 and methods of its use, including 
ophthalmic uses, through 2031. Furthermore, we have an issued U.S. patent covering our AR-1105 implant, which provides patent protection for AR-1105 in the United States through 2036, as well as pending foreign counterparts that upon issuance will provide patent protection internationally through 2036. We also have patent protection for AR-13503 in the United States and internationally, which extends to 2030, and have filed for patent protection in the United States and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and synthetic methods.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, ocular surface diseases and retinal diseases. We believe Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® have the potential to address many of the unmet medical needs in the glaucoma market, AR-15512 in the ocular surface disease market, and clinical implants AR-1105 and AR-13503 SR and preclinical implant AR-14034 SR in the retinal disease market.
Key elements of our strategy are to:
•Successfully commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States.
Our sales organization, along with the addition of a contract sales organization and telesales team, is targeting approximately 16,000 of the highest prescribing eye-care professionals in the United States, and sales volumes have grown consistently since the launch of each product.
•Advance the development of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in jurisdictions outside the United States to regulatory approval and commercialize in Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia.
In Europe, we reported positive interim topline 90-day efficacy data for Mercury 3, which we deem to be an important determinant as we evaluate the commercialization and profitability potential of Rhokiinsa®, and particularly Roclanda®, in Europe. Roclanda® achieved non-inferiority to a fixed-dose combination in Europe (Ganfort®). As a result we have received interest from third parties interested in a potential collaboration partnership, with whom we are currently engaged, while we are simultaneously preparing on our own for pricing discussions in Germany.
We entered into the Santen Agreement in October 2020 to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Japan and other countries in Asia. We initiated a Rhopressa® Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan in December 2020. For additional product and trial information see “—Our Products, Product Candidates and Pipeline” below.
•Supply all clinical and commercial ophthalmic products from the Athlone manufacturing plant for all markets in which we plan to commercialize, while maintaining our secondary suppliers.
We have a sterile fill production facility in Athlone, Ireland, for the production of our FDA approved products and clinical supplies with the goal of having the Athlone manufacturing plant supply our ophthalmic products in all markets for which we receive regulatory approval and are commercialized. For additional information see “—Manufacturing” below.
•Expand our product candidate portfolio and pipeline through internal discovery efforts, research collaboration arrangements and in-licensing or acquisitions of additional product candidates, products or technologies.
We continue to seek to discover and develop new compounds in our research laboratories focused on ophthalmic opportunities. In addition, we may enter into additional research collaborations or license arrangements or complete additional acquisitions to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, as we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas.
Through business development activities, we have acquired the clinical-stage dry eye product candidate AR-15512 from Avizorex, worldwide ophthalmic rights to a bio-erodible polymer technology from DSM and PRINT® implant manufacturing technology from Envisia. With respect to research collaborations, in connection with entering into the Santen Agreement and the positive topline Mercury 3 results, we have received interest from third parties for a potential collaboration for the clinical development and potential future commercialization of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Europe and potentially elsewhere. We have commenced such discussions with various potential collaborators.
With respect to product candidates, we have commenced a U.S. Phase 2b clinical trial of AR-15512, our dry eye product candidate, we are evaluating the path to a Phase 3 clinical trial for sustained-release retinal implant AR-1105 in both the United States and Europe and our first-in-human clinical trial for sustained-release retinal implant AR-13503 SR is ongoing. With respect to AR-1105, in addition to pursuing next steps regarding clinical advancement, we are also evaluating commercialization prospects in both Europe and the United States. We are in the process of meeting with regulatory agencies in order to harmonize development plans across both Europe and the United States. We believe that the commercial prospects for AR-1105 in Europe are potentially greater than for the Aerie glaucoma franchise in Europe and as a result, we expect to ultimately commercialize this product candidate, if approved, on our own or with a partner. We are also working to advance our preclinical sustained-release retinal implant, AR-14034 SR, for which we anticipate filing an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2022.
•Continue to leverage and strengthen our intellectual property portfolio.
We believe we have a strong intellectual property position based upon issued patents and pending applications in the United States and internationally, including in Europe and Japan, relating to Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®. Moreover, patents for AR-1105 in the United States provides protection through 2036, and we continue to pursue patent protection for it internationally. If successful, AR-1105 is expected to have international patent protection to 2036. In addition, regarding AR-15512, the Avizorex acquisition has provided us with patent protection in the United States through 2031, and we are pursuing international patent protection that upon issuance is expected to provide patent protection through 2031. We also continue to pursue efforts to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio regarding AR-13503 in the United States and internationally. Our intellectual property portfolio contains U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and synthetic methods.

Our Products, Product Candidates and Pipeline
Rhopressa®
Rhopressa® is the first of a new class of glaucoma drug products that was discovered by our scientists. It was approved by the FDA in December 2017 for the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It was also granted a Centralised MA by the EC in November 2019. Our key target markets outside the United States include Europe and Japan and other countries in Asia.
The active ingredient in Rhopressa®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned ROCK inhibitor. ROCK is a protein kinase, which is an enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them. Specifically, ROCK regulates actin and myosin, which are proteins that are responsible for cellular contraction. ROCK activity also promotes the production of extracellular matrix proteins. ROCK inhibitors block cell contraction in the TM outflow pathway and reduce the production of extracellular matrix, thereby improving TM fluid outflow and consequently reducing IOP.
Rhopressa® is competing primarily in the adjunctive therapy market, which represents approximately one-half of the U.S. glaucoma prescription market, which in aggregate totaled approximately 36 million prescriptions and 55 million units in 2019 according to IQVIA. Healthcare professionals most frequently prescribe Rhopressa® as a concomitant therapy to prostaglandins or non-PGA medications when additional IOP reduction is desired. We believe Rhopressa® is primarily competing with other non-PGA products, due to its targeting of the diseased TM, its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, its preferred once-daily dosing relative to other currently marketed non-PGA products, and its safety profile. Currently marketed therapies that are used adjunctively to PGAs are older generation products that are generally dosed between two and three times a day, have MOA(s) focused on reducing fluid production, often have lower efficacy levels and have systemic side effects. Rhopressa® provides eye-care professionals with a valuable alternative therapy to what has been historically available. We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products. In November 2019, we released topline data from our Phase 4 Multi-center Open-label study (“MOST”) trial, which observed Rhopressa® efficacy in various real-world clinical settings, including as an adjunctive therapy and monotherapy. The results indicated positive IOP reduction in all settings along with a favorable tolerability profile.
Rhopressa® in the United States
We launched Rhopressa® in the United States in April 2018. It is being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rhopressa® through pharmacies across the United States. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® for the majority of lives covered under commercial and Medicare Part D plans.
Rhopressa® Outside of the United States
In Europe, in November 2019, the EC granted a Centralised MA for Rhokiinsa®.
In support of a potential regulatory submission for Rhopressa® in Japan, we conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial, a successful pilot Phase 2 clinical study in the United States on Japanese and Japanese-American subjects, as well as a successful Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in Japan. In July 2019, we completed enrollment of a Phase 2 clinical trial in Japan and topline results were released in November 2019. These studies were designed in accordance with the requirements of the PMDA on Japanese patients in Japan to support subsequent Phase 3 registration trials have recently commenced in Japan. Topline results of the Phase 2 clinical trial indicated positive efficacy and tolerability results for the patient population. We held a meeting with the Japanese PMDA in April 2020 to discuss Phase 3 clinical trial designs for Rhopressa®, while continuing to prepare for the trials. We initiated the first Rhopressa® Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect to have three Phase 3 clinical trials, two of which will be 28-day trials and one of which will be a 12-month safety trial. Further, in October 2020, we entered into the Santen Agreement to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Japan and eight other countries in Asia.
Rocklatan®
Rocklatan® is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and was approved by the FDA in March 2019. Based on our clinical data, we believe that Rocklatan® has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any glaucoma medication currently marketed in the United States. We also believe that Rocklatan® competes with both PGA and non-PGA therapies for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.
Rocklatan® in the United States
We launched Rocklatan® in the United States in May 2019. Rocklatan® is now being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rocklatan® through pharmacies across the United States. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rocklatan® for the majority of lives covered under commercial and Medicare Part D plans.
Rocklatan® Outside of the United States
In Europe, the clinical trials Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 represent the basis for European approval of Roclanda®. We also initiated a Phase 3b clinical registration trial for Roclanda®, named Mercury 3, in Europe during the third quarter of 2017. Mercury 3, a six-month efficacy and safety trial, is designed to compare Roclanda® to Ganfort®, a fixed-dose combination product marketed in Europe consisting of bimatoprost (a PGA) and timolol (a beta blocker). In September 2020, we read out interim topline 90-day efficacy data for Mercury 3. The results indicated Roclanda® met the overall trial objective by demonstrating non-inferiority to Ganfort® across nine of nine timepoints over 90 days. Roclanda® also demonstrated consistent IOP reduction throughout the day, with the IOP reductions observed in Mercury 3 exceeding those from both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2. Mercury 3 was not required for regulatory approval; it was designed to gauge the commercialization prospects in Europe. We deemed the Mercury 3 results to be an important determinant as we evaluated the commercialization and profitability potential of Rhokiinsa®, and particularly Roclanda®, in Europe.
In December 2019, the MAA for Roclanda® was accepted for review by the EMA and in November 2020, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the MAA for Roclanda®. In January 2021, Roclanda® was granted a Centralised MA by the EC. Since Roclanda® is a fixed-dose combination product that includes Rhokiinsa®, the MAA submission for Roclanda® was predicated on the receipt of a Centralised MA for Rhokiinsa®, which the EC granted in November 2019. In Japan, clinical trials for Rocklatan® have not yet begun.
As a result of the positive Mercury 3 results, third parties have expressed interest in a commercialization partnership in Europe, while we are simultaneously preparing on our own for pricing discussions in Germany. Some third parties have stated potential interest in a commercialization partnership beyond just Europe and discussions are underway. According to IQVIA, it is estimated that the European glaucoma market for the five largest European national markets represented approximately $1 billion in sales with 105 million units in 2019, compared to approximately 55 million units in the United States. We would pursue manufacturing rights with any collaboration and source product from our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland.
Product Candidates and Pipeline Opportunities
To complement our internal research through business development opportunities, we obtained the clinical-stage dry eye product candidate AVX-012 (now named AR-15512) through the acquisition of Avizorex in late 2019. Furthermore, we have also acquired worldwide ophthalmic rights to a bio-erodible polymer technology from DSM and PRINT® implant manufacturing technology, which is a proprietary technology capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained-release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes, from Envisia. Using these technologies, we have created a sustained-release ophthalmology platform and are currently developing three sustained-release implants focused on retinal diseases, AR-1105, AR-13503 SR and AR-14034 SR, and in the future we believe this technology may be useful as we explore additional sustained-release applications.
AR-15512 (TRPM8 receptor)
In December 2019, we acquired Avizorex, a Spanish ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. Avizorex completed a Phase 2a study in dry eye subjects in 2019 for its lead product candidate AVX-012 (now named AR-15512). The active ingredient in AR-15512 is a potent and selective agonist of the TRPM8 ion channel, a cold sensor and osmolarity sensor that regulates tear production and blink rate. In addition, activating the TRPM8 receptor may reduce ocular discomfort by promoting a cooling sensation. By stimulating these processes in a physiological manner, TRPM8 agonists have the potential to restore tear film stability and reduce discomfort in patients with dry eye. Positive results from the Phase 2a study support the therapeutic potential of AR-15512 to treat signs and symptoms of dry eye. We met with the FDA in June 2020 and are planning to test two concentrations of AR-15512 in a 90-day Phase 2b clinical trial with 360 subjects, which could potentially be considered pivotal. For this upcoming trial, known as COMET-1, we expect the primary endpoints to be ocular discomfort and tear production. The Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for AR-15512 eye drop for dry eye became effective in September 2020, allowing Aerie to initiate clinical studies in the treatment of dry eye. We initiated COMET-1 in October 2020 and a topline readout is expected in the third quarter of 2021.
AR-1105 Implant (dexamethasone steroid)
In October 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT® technology in ophthalmology and certain other assets from Envisia. In addition, we acquired Envisia’s intellectual property rights relating to a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant using a biodegradable polymer-based drug delivery system that is comprised of a blend of different polymers and PRINT® technology for the potential treatment of macular edema due to RVO and diabetic retinopathy (“DR”), which we refer to as AR-1105. We submitted the IND for AR-1105 in December 2018 and the IND became effective in January 2019. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of AR-1105 in patients with macular edema due to RVO during March 2019 and completed enrollment in October 2019. In July 2020, we reported topline results of the Phase 2 clinical trial for AR-1105 indicating sustained efficacy of up to six months, an important achievement in validating the potential capabilities of Aerie’s sustained release platform.
With respect to future plans for AR-1105, we are currently evaluating next steps regarding advancement towards Phase 3 clinical trials along with commercialization prospects in both Europe and the United States. We are in the process of meeting with regulatory agencies in order to harmonize development plans across both Europe and the United States. According to IQVIA, the market for retinal diseases therapeutics totaled nearly $7 billion in the United States and $4 billion in Europe in 2019, yet the injectable steroid market component is in fact currently higher in Europe than in the United States. We believe AR-1105, with the six-month sustained release efficacy profile demonstrated in the Phase 2 data, may be able to further expand the injectable steroid market in both the United States and Europe. The closest competitive product currently generates approximately $100 million in annual net sales in the United States and $300 million in Europe and generally in practice is injected once every two to three months. We believe that the commercial prospects for AR-1105 in Europe are potentially greater than for the Aerie glaucoma franchise in Europe and as a result we expect to ultimately commercialize this product candidate, if approved, on our own or with a partner.
AR-13503 SR Implant (ROCK and Protein kinase inhibitor)
Our owned small molecule, AR-13503, is a ROCK and Protein kinase C inhibitor and is the active ingredient in our AR-13503 sustained-release implant. AR-13503 SR has potential for the treatment of DME, wet AMD and other diseases of the retina. AR-13503, which has the active metabolite of Rhopressa®, has been shown to reduce lesion size in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Since AR-13503 is a small molecule with a short half-life when injected into the back of the eye, and the aforementioned diseases are located in the back of the eye, a delivery mechanism was needed to deliver the molecule to the back of the eye for a sustained delivery period. Using our licensed technology from DSM, AR-13503 has been combined with a polyesteramide polymer to produce an injectable, thin fiber implant that is minute in size. Preclinical experiments with the AR-13503 SR implant have demonstrated linear, sustained elution rates over several months and achievement of target retinal drug concentrations.
When used in combination preclinically with the market-leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative DR. Pending additional studies, AR-13503 may have the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat DME, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, potentially as an adjunctive therapy to current anti-VEGF therapies. The IND for AR-13503 SR became effective in April 2019, allowing us to initiate human studies in the treatment of wet AMD and DME. We initiated a first-in-human clinical safety study for AR-13503 SR in the third quarter of 2019, which is currently ongoing.
AR-14034 SR Implant (pan-VEGF receptor inhibitor)
The active ingredient in our preclinical AR-14034 sustained-release implant is axitinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptors. Axitinib is currently approved by the FDA in the United States for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. AR-14034 SR may have the potential to treat wet AMD, DME and other diseases of the retina. Unlike the anti-VEGF products currently approved for wet AMD and DME that inhibit only one or two of the four known VEGFs, studies have shown axitinib inhibits signaling from all four VEGFs by inhibiting all known VEGF receptors. Based on preclinical data, axitinib has been shown to inhibit choroidal neovascularization and to reduce vessel leakage in preclinical models of wet AMD and DME. Axitinib has been formulated with a proprietary blend of polymers to produce an injectable, bioerodible implant that, based on preclinical data, has the potential to sustain effective retinal drug concentrations for up to 12 months following a single intravitreal injection in patients.
Pending additional studies, AR-14034 SR may have the potential to provide a once per-year injection to treat DME, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, which has the potential to greatly reduce the treatment burden for patients and their physicians. We anticipate filing the IND for AR-14034 SR with the FDA in the second half of 2022, which if accepted, would allow us to initiate human studies in the treatment of wet AMD and DME.
Other Pipeline Opportunities
We continue to leverage the use of the PRINT® technology platform to evaluate the sustained-release of additional small molecule therapies for other ophthalmic indications. We commenced operation of our current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”)-validated manufacturing facility for production of ophthalmic implants using PRINT® technology in our Durham, North Carolina, facility in October 2018.
We may continue to enter into research collaboration arrangements, license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, and we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners and on our own.
We own over 4,000 ROCK inhibitor molecules, some of which have additional features including the inhibition of other kinases such as Janus kinase and those in the IĸB family and we evaluate this library on an ongoing basis for additional development opportunities. Early stage evaluations of these molecules are underway for other ophthalmic indications. We continue to evaluate outside business development opportunities to provide access to technologies developed outside of Aerie to complement our internal research.
Glaucoma Overview
Glaucoma Market Overview
Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. In 2019, branded and generic glaucoma product sales were approximately $5.0 billion in the United States, the top five national markets in Europe and Japan in aggregate, according to IQVIA. Prescription volume in 2019 for glaucoma products in the United States alone was 36 million, representing 55 million bottles, and is expected to grow, driven in large part by the aging population.
The PGA and non-PGA market segments each represent approximately one-half of the prescription volume in the United States glaucoma market, as shown in the following chart, which is based on IQVIA data.
According to the National Eye Institute, it is estimated that over 2.7 million people in the United States suffer from glaucoma, a number that is expected to reach approximately 4.3 million by 2030. Furthermore, The Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group has estimated that only half of the U.S. glaucoma sufferers know that they have the disease. Glaucoma is a progressive and highly individualized disease, in which elevated levels of IOP are associated with damage to the optic nerve, resulting in irreversible vision loss and potentially blindness. Patients may suffer the adverse effects of glaucoma across a wide range of IOP levels. There are multiple factors that can contribute to an individual developing glaucoma, including, but not limited to, age, family history and ethnicity. Glaucoma is treated by the reduction of IOP, which has been shown to slow the progression of vision loss. In a healthy eye, fluid is continuously produced and drained in order to maintain pressure equilibrium and provide nutrients to the eye tissue. The FDA recognizes sustained reduction of IOP as the primary clinical endpoint for the approval of drugs to treat patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary drainage mechanism of the eye is the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage in a healthy eye, while the secondary drainage mechanism, the uveoscleral pathway, is responsible for the remaining drainage. In glaucoma patients, damage to the TM results in insufficient drainage of fluid from the eye, which causes increased IOP and damage to the optic nerve.
Once glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is typically the use of prescription eye drops. PGAs have become the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug class. The most frequently prescribed PGA is once-daily latanoprost. The most commonly prescribed non-PGA drugs belong to the beta blocker class. The most frequently prescribed beta blocker is twice-daily timolol. Other non-PGA drug classes include the alpha agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. When PGA monotherapy is insufficient to control IOP or contraindicated due to concerns about side effects, non-PGA products are used either as add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy. It is estimated that up to 50% of glaucoma patients receiving PGA monotherapy require add-on therapy within two years of initial prescription of such PGA monotherapy to maintain adequate control of IOP.
We believe there are significant unmet needs in the glaucoma market as is evident by the degree of use of multiple therapies to treat patients with the disease and understand that eye-care professionals are eager for new therapy choices, as we have seen with the launch-to-date volume growth in the United States for both Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®. PGAs have side effects, contraindications and reduced efficacy in patients with low to moderately elevated IOPs relative to patients with higher IOPs. Other currently marketed non-PGAs are less efficacious than PGAs, have more serious and a greater number of side effects and 
contraindications, and require multiple daily doses. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need in both the PGA and non-PGA market segments, each of which represents approximately one-half of the U.S. and European glaucoma market based on prescription volumes, according to IQVIA. Despite the limitations of existing glaucoma drugs, Xalatan® (latanoprost), the best-selling PGA, together with Xalacom®, its fixed-dose combination with a beta blocker, which is not available in the United States, generated peak annual global revenues of approximately $1.7 billion prior to the introduction of their generic equivalents, and the most commonly prescribed non-PGA drugs each generated peak annual global revenues of over $400 million prior to the introduction of their generic equivalents. Rhopressa® is the first of a new class of glaucoma drug products and may be prescribed by eye-care professionals as a preferred adjunctive therapy for patients taking PGAs, due to its IOP-reducing ability, more convenient dosing and better tolerability profile compared to other currently marketed non-PGA adjunctive products. Based on our clinical data, we believe that Rocklatan®, a fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any glaucoma medication currently marketed in the United States. We also believe that Rocklatan® competes with both PGA and non-PGA therapies for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of currently available therapies.
Glaucoma Medical Overview
Glaucoma is generally characterized by relatively high IOP as a result of impaired drainage of fluid, known as aqueous humor, from the eye. The FDA recognizes sustained reduction of IOP, measured in terms of millimeters of mercury (“mmHg”), as the primary clinical endpoint for regulatory approval, making clinical trials for this indication relatively straight-forward due to easily measured objective parameters.
In a healthy eye, aqueous humor is continuously produced and drained from the eye in order to maintain pressure equilibrium and provide micronutrients to various tissues in the eye. An insufficient drainage of fluid can increase IOP above normal levels, which can eventually cause damage to the optic nerve. The normal range of IOP is generally between 10 and 21 mmHg. Several studies have demonstrated that the significant majority of glaucoma patients have IOPs between 21 and 26 mmHg at the time of diagnosis. Once damaged, the optic nerve cannot regenerate and thus damage to vision is permanent.
The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by abnormally high IOP as a result of impaired drainage of fluid from the eye’s primary drain, the TM. Open-angle glaucoma is a progressive disease leading to vision loss and blindness for some patients as a result of irreversible damage to the optic nerve.
Studies of the disease have demonstrated that reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma can help slow or halt further damage to the optic nerve and help preserve vision. Once diagnosed, glaucoma requires life-long treatment to maintain IOP at lower levels based on the individual patient’s risk of disease progression. Ophthalmologists will routinely determine a target IOP, which represents the desired IOP level to achieve with glaucoma therapy for an individual patient. Further IOP reduction may be required to prevent additional damage to the optic nerve and further vision loss should the disease progress despite achieving the initial target IOP. This may require reducing IOP until it is in the so-called “low normal range” of 12 mmHg to 14 mmHg to protect the optic nerve from further damage.
There are multiple factors that can contribute to an individual developing open-angle glaucoma, including, but not limited to, age, family history and ethnicity. For example, there generally is a higher incidence and severity of the disease in African-American and Hispanic populations.
Some patients with high IOP are diagnosed with a condition known as ocular hypertension. Patients with ocular hypertension have high IOP without the loss of visual fields or observable damage to the optic nerve and are at an increased risk of developing glaucoma. These patients are commonly treated in the same manner as glaucoma patients.
The following diagram illustrates how increased IOP eventually leads to increased pressure on the optic nerve, resulting in gradual loss of vision and ultimately visual disability and blindness.
The ciliary body in the eye is the tissue that produces aqueous humor, the production of which is commonly referred to as fluid inflow. The fluid leaves the eye primarily through the TM, the process of which is commonly referred to as fluid outflow. The healthy eye maintains a state of IOP homeostasis through a constant physiological process of aqueous humor production and drainage. The deteriorating function of the TM in glaucoma leads to increased resistance to fluid outflow and higher IOP. There is also a secondary drain for the fluid in the eye known as the uveoscleral pathway, which is typically responsible for approximately 20% of fluid drainage in a healthy eye.
In addition to aqueous humor production and drainage through the TM and uveoscleral pathway, episcleral venous pressure (“EVP”) plays a significant role in the regulation of IOP. EVP represents the pressure of the blood in the episcleral veins of the eye which are the site of drainage of eye fluid into the bloodstream. Historical studies have shown that EVP accounts for approximately 8 mmHg to 10 mmHg of IOP, or approximately one-half of IOP in patients with pressures near the normotensive level of 21 mmHg, and approximately one-third of IOP in patients with pressures of 24 mmHg to 30 mmHg. When EVP is reduced, aqueous humor is able to flow more freely from the eye.
Patients are diagnosed through measurements of IOP using Goldmann applanation tonometry, the standard device used by clinicians to measure IOP, along with an evaluation of visual fields and observing the appearance of the optic nerve. These tests are routinely carried out by eye-care professionals. The initial treatment for patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension is typically a PGA eye drop. PGAs are designed to reduce IOP by increasing outflow through the eye’s secondary fluid drain. An eye-care professional will then measure a patient’s response to the drug over the first few months. It has been shown that up to 50% of glaucoma patients require more than one drug to treat their IOP. This may occur as early as three to six months after initiating treatment with a PGA. The eye-care professionals may then add a second drug from one of the non-PGA classes, to be used together with the initial drug, or switch to a fixed-dose combination of two drugs in a single eye drop, or select an alternative single treatment. The reason so many patients eventually need more than one drug is generally considered to be a reflection of the progressive nature of the disease at the TM.
In severe glaucoma cases, patients may need to undergo an invasive surgical procedure. Trabeculectomy is the most common glaucoma-related surgical procedure, also referred to as filtration surgery, in which a piece of tissue in the drainage angle of the eye is removed, creating an opening to the outside of the eye. The opening is partially covered with a scleral flap, the white part of the eye, and the conjunctiva, the thin membrane covering the sclera. This new opening allows fluid to drain out of the eye, bypassing the clogged drainage channels of the TM to maintain a reduced IOP. There are also laser surgeries which apply laser energy to the eye’s drainage tissue to improve the outflow of fluid. Devices called shunts are used in glaucoma surgery to divert fluid in a controlled manner from the inside of the eye to the subconjunctival space bypassing the blocked TM. Generally, the shunts reduce IOP to the extent that the use of drops can be reduced, but often not completely eliminated. Many patients continue to require eye drops even following surgery.
Ocular Surface Diseases Overview
Dry eye is a multifactorial, symptomatic disorder of the ocular surface and tear film. Dry eye has been associated with either decreased tear production, increased tear evaporation, or a combination of both. Symptoms of dry eye include ocular discomfort, dryness, and visual disturbance. Dry eye has been shown to contribute to difficulties with everyday activities, including reading, using a computer and driving. Artificial tears are the most common initial treatment for dry eye disease, but artificial tears often fail to adequately address the signs and symptoms of dry eye.
The U.S. dry eye disease market was approximately $1.6 billion in 2019, according to third-party sources and internal estimates. It is estimated that there are approximately 30 million dry eye sufferers in the United States with approximately 10 percent currently being treated. Currently marketed prescription products often lack efficacy and also have a significant number of treatment burdens, including significant instillation site discomfort, delayed onset of efficacy up to twelve weeks, taste altering effects, and hence relatively low persistence rates. We believe that the dry eye space remains a very large and underserved market. These unmet needs generated our interest in proceeding with the acquisition of Avizorex, a Spanish ophthalmic pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye disease. AR-15512 has a novel MOA whereby corneal TRPM8 receptors are modulated, improving signs of dry eye by stimulating basal tear production, and symptoms of dry eye by providing a cooling sensation upon instillation.
Retinal Diseases Overview
The U.S. market for wet AMD, DR and RVO was approximately $6.8 billion in 2019, according to IQVIA. AMD is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in individuals over 50 years of age in developed countries. Clinically, it manifests in two forms: wet AMD and dry AMD. Wet AMD is responsible for a rapid and substantial vision decline characterized by abnormal growth and leakage of blood vessels that breaks through the Bruch’s membrane into the subretinal pigment epithelium space and/or the subretinal space, leading to exudation, hemorrhage, retinal edema, pigment epithelial detachment and fibrous scarring.
DR is the leading cause of vision loss among working age individuals in developed countries and DME is a common cause of vision loss associated with DR. DME occurs due to retinal microvasculature damage, increase in vascular permeability and loss of blood-retinal barrier leading to interstitial fluid accumulation in the retina, particularly in the region of the macula.
RVO is the second-most common sight-threatening vascular disorder of the retina after DR. Current estimates put global prevalence at approximately 16 million people affected with the disease in one or both eyes and approximately 520 new cases per million are reported each year.
In wet AMD, DME and RVO, vascular permeability, angiogenesis and inflammation play an important role and VEGF has shown to be a key mediator that has been found to be upregulated. Currently, the standard of care for treating these diseases is intravitreal (“IVT”) injection of VEGF inhibitors (“anti-VEGF”). In addition, an alternative therapeutic approach for DME and RVO is IVT injection of corticosteroids. 
Existing anti-VEGF agents have similar safety and efficacy profiles. Three are the most widely used: bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept. Although anti-VEGF agents have shown a well-established efficacy profile in wet AMD and DME, a downside of these treatments is that some patients have poor response, experience a loss of efficacy after repeated injections over time or require frequent injections to maintain complete resolution of the exudation/edema. Thus, the need for alternative treatment options with prolonged treatment duration to reduce treatment burden of repeat injections and different mechanism of action to target refractory or non-response to anti-VEGF agents leaves a considerable unmet need. We are developing AR-13503 SR implant to address these unmet needs.
Our drug-eluting implants for retinal disease have the potential to address these unmet needs. AR-1105 has the potential to provide a longer duration therapy for patients with DME or RVO. AR-1105 is designed to be injected once every six months, whereas the currently available dexamethasone implant, OZURDEX®, typically requires injections approximately once every three months. As a longer duration dexamethasone implant, AR-1105 has the potential to provide the benefit of reducing the treatment burden on patients while treating the inflammatory components of macular edema that are not addressed by inhibition of VEGF. Additionally, since AR-1105 delivers a smaller dose of dexamethasone, there exists the potential for reduced corticosteroid-related adverse events such as cataract formation and increased IOP.
The AR-13503 SR implant potentially addresses the need for new therapies that act differently from the anti-VEGF and corticosteroid products. As an inhibitor of the kinases ROCK and protein kinase c, AR-13503 has the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat DME, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, potentially as an adjunctive therapy in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Since the AR-13503 SR implant is designed to 
be injected once every six months, it also has the potential to reduce treatment burden on patients, especially those who may require multiple therapies to adequately treat their disease.
The AR-14034 SR implant potentially addresses the need to reduce the injection frequency of anti-VEGF therapies. The AR-14034 SR implant is designed to reduce the treatment burden on patients and physicians by providing a once per-year anti-VEGF injection. The active ingredient, axitinib, has been shown to provide a blockade of all VEGF signaling pathways, which has the potential to provide greater efficacy than current products that block only one or two of the four VEGFs related to retinal disease.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, for example, Bausch Health Companies Inc., Novartis International AG, AbbVie Inc., Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products or technologies to treat glaucoma or other diseases of the eye. Products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®, are likely to be efficacy and their respective MOA(s), safety, convenience, price, tolerability and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. In addition, our segment of the industry is highly competitive and is currently dominated by generic drugs, such as latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. Our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payers encourage the use of generic products. Further, surgical advances, including devices and implants designed to reduce IOP, may have a longer-term effect on the glaucoma eye drop market. We currently expect to compete directly against companies producing existing and future glaucoma treatment products. The most commonly approved classes of eye drops to reduce IOP in glaucoma are discussed below:
PGA Drug Class

•Prostaglandin Analogues (“PGAs”). Most PGAs are once-daily dosed eye drops generally prescribed as the initial drug to reduce IOP by increasing fluid outflow through the eye’s secondary drain. PGAs represent approximately one-half of the U.S. and European prescription volume for the treatment of glaucoma.
Xalatan® (latanoprost), the best-selling PGA, together with Xalacom®, its fixed-dose combination with a beta blocker, which is not available in the United States, had worldwide peak sales of approximately $1.7 billion before its patent expired in 2012, according to publicly reported sales. The adverse effects of PGAs include conjunctival hyperemia, or eye redness, irreversible change in iris color, discoloration of the skin around the eyes, and droopiness of eyelids caused by the loss of orbital fat. PGAs should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation.
Non-PGA Drug Class

•Beta Blockers. Beta blockers, most commonly prescribed as drugs to treat hypertension, are also prescribed for glaucoma. With their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production, are one of the oldest approved drugs for the reduction of IOP. The most commonly used drug in this class is timolol. Beta blockers are less effective than PGAs in terms of IOP reduction and are typically used twice daily. Beta blockers are the most commonly used non-PGA drug. They are used as an initially prescribed monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy to PGAs when the efficacy of PGAs is insufficient. Beta blocker eye drops have contraindications in their label as a result of potential systemic exposures from the topical application of the eye drops, potentially leading to cardio-pulmonary events such as bronchospasm, arrhythmia and heart failure.
•Topical Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production, are less effective than PGAs and are required to be dosed three times daily in order to obtain the desired IOP reduction. In published clinical studies of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the most frequently reported adverse events reported were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are sulfonamides and, as such, systemic exposure increases risk of adverse responses such as Stevens Johnson syndrome and blood dyscrasias.
•Alpha Agonists. Alpha agonists, with their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production plus their effect on uveoscleral outflow, are less effective than PGAs and need to be dosed three times daily in order to obtain the desired IOP reduction. In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions that occurred in individuals receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution, a commonly prescribed alpha agonist, included allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness and visual disturbance.
Despite their modest efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles, the requirement for two to three doses per day, and the fact that they do not target the diseased tissue in glaucoma, beta blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and alpha agonist products account for up to one-half of the total prescription volume for the treatment of glaucoma based on historical prescription patterns, with beta blocker timolol being the most widely prescribed non-PGA drug. This is driven by the PGA products not being sufficiently effective as monotherapy for up to half of all glaucoma patients. Fixed-dose combination glaucoma products are also currently marketed in the United States, including Cosopt®, the combination of a beta blocker with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and Combigan®, the combination of a beta blocker with an alpha agonist. There are no fixed-dose combinations of PGAs with other glaucoma drugs currently available in the United States.
New eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma continue to be developed by our competitors. The following table outlines publicly disclosed development programs for the treatment of glaucoma of which we are aware:

NCX-470 (Nicox) | NO donating bimatoprost (qd) | United States: Phase 3 

(1)Not usable as add-on therapy to current PGAs.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Early-stage companies are also developing treatments for open-angle glaucoma, ocular surface diseases and retinal diseases and may prove to be significant competitors. We expect that our competitors will continue to develop new treatments for open-angle glaucoma, ocular surface diseases and retinal diseases, which may include eye drops, oral treatments, surgical procedures, implantable devices or laser treatments. Alternative treatments beyond eye drops continue to develop.
Early-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, commercial and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
Sales and Marketing
We have commercialized Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States with our own focused, specialized sales force. Our commercial team responsible for the sales of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® includes approximately 100 sales representatives targeting eye-care professionals throughout the United States, and with the addition of a contract sales organization and a separate telesales team, we are able to reach over 16,000 eye-care professionals.
We have obtained formulary coverage for the majority of lives covered for our glaucoma products under commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans. Product affordability for the patient drives consumer acceptance, and this is generally managed through coverage by third-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (“Third-party Payers”) and such product may be subject to rebates and discounts payable directly to those Third-party Payers.
Outside of the United States we may enter into a collaboration agreement to commercialize Rhokiinsa® and Roclanda® in Europe. We are currently engaged in discussions with potential partners for Europe and potentially other geographies with various potential partners, while we are simultaneously preparing on our own for pricing discussions in Germany. In October 2020, we entered into the Santen Agreement to advance our clinical development and ultimately commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in Japan and eight other countries in Asia.
Major Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2020, a significant percentage of our sales of Rhopressa® were to three large wholesale drug distributors. Sales to McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation accounted for 37.4%, 32.4% and 28.8% of total revenues, respectively, for the year then ended.
Manufacturing
We currently rely on our manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, and our current contract manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® and currently rely on our third-party manufacturers to produce the API. We may rely on a combination of internal manufacturing and third-party manufacturers for our product candidates and future product candidates. 
The commercial production of the final drug product is supported by a combination of internal and outsourced manufacturing. In the second quarter of 2019, we completed the build-out of our own manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, for commercial production of Rocklatan® and Rhopressa®. In January 2020, we received FDA approval to produce Rocklatan® at the Athlone manufacturing plant for commercial distribution in the United States. This approval follows a successful pre-approval inspection of the plant and FDA review of the Prior Approval Supplement (“PAS”), which added the Athlone manufacturing plant as a drug product manufacturer for Rocklatan®. The manufacturing plant began production of commercial supplies of Rocklatan® during the first quarter of 2020. Shipments of commercial supply of Rocklatan® from the Athlone manufacturing plant to the United States commenced in the third quarter of 2020. We filed a PAS with the FDA in the second quarter of 2020 and received FDA approval to produce Rhopressa® at the Athlone manufacturing plant in September 2020. The Athlone manufacturing plant commenced shipping commercial supply of Rhopressa® to the United States during the fourth quarter of 2020 and has also manufactured clinical supplies of Rhopressa® for the Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan. We also expect the Athlone manufacturing plant will have adequate capacity to produce Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® for the United States as well as both the European and Japanese commercial markets. We may continue to use contract manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® for distribution in the United States, but at reduced levels compared to before the Athlone manufacturing plant was operational.
In addition to our current contract manufacturers, we have also obtained FDA approval for an additional Rhopressa® drug product contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2019, which began to supply commercial product in the second quarter of 2019. Further, we have obtained FDA approval for an additional API contract manufacturer, which began to supply commercial API in the second quarter of 2019. We have also received FDA approval of an additional Rocklatan® drug product contract manufacturer in January 2020, which began to supply commercial product in the first quarter of 2020. Latanoprost, used in the manufacture of Rocklatan®, is available in commercial quantities from multiple reputable third-party manufacturers. We expect that in 2021 the Athlone manufacturing plant will manufacture most of our needs for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States.
We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. However, should a supplier or manufacturer on which we have relied to produce Rhopressa®, Rocklatan®, Rhokiinsa®, Roclanda® or any current or future product candidate provides us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience reputational harm, delays and additional costs, each of which could be significant.
As demand for Athlone sourced products grows, we may need to continue to use product sourced from our contract manufacturers when the manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, is fully operational. We need to continue to hire and train qualified employees to staff this facility. The management and operation of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility requires the implementation and development of procedures that are compliant with the quality and other regulations dictated by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions for which product is produced. Failure to maintain such compliance could cause us to experience delays in production, reputational harm and could negatively affect our commercial operations.
Intellectual Property
We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan®. We have obtained patent protection for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® (patent protection for Rocklatan® includes patent protection we have secured for Rhopressa®), in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including in, but not limited to, Europe and Asia, and will seek and are seeking patent protection in additional foreign jurisdictions from time to time as we deem appropriate. We intend to maintain and defend our patent rights to protect our technology, inventions, processes and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. Our commercial success depends on the viability of our existing, future developed or future acquired intellectual property to be useful to provide protection to our products and also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of patents and pending patent applications related to the compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and synthetic methods. We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® in the United States through early 2034. Additionally, we hold patents for composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and method of use in certain foreign jurisdictions for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan® through 2034 and have filed for patent protection in the United States and internationally through 2037.
With respect to our product candidates, through the acquisition of Avizorex, we are the exclusive licensee through 2031 of issued U.S. patents providing patent protection for pharmaceutical compositions comprising AR-15512 (previously named AVX-012) and methods of its use, including ophthalmic uses. The Avizorex acquisition also enabled Aerie to be the exclusive licensee of pending foreign counterparts to the issued U.S. patents regarding AR-15512. Should these foreign counterparts issue such patents, they will provide patent protection for pharmaceutical compositions in such jurisdictions comprising AR-15512 and methods of its use, including ophthalmic uses, through 2031. Furthermore, we have an issued U.S. patent for AR-1105, which provides patent protection for AR-1105 in the United States through 2036, as well as pending foreign counterparts that upon issuance will provide patent protection internationally through 2036. We also have patent protection for AR-13503 in the United States and internationally, which extends to 2030, and have filed for patent protection in the United States and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037.
We also hold patents and have pending patent applications for other ROCK inhibitor molecules.

Regulatory Matters
FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board (“IRB”) of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the research, clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. See “—The NDA Approval Process” below.
The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
•submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to assure the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, administrators, and monitors;
•pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and
•FDA approval of an NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold.
IND and Clinical Trials
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, drug developers must submit an initial IND to the FDA, which contains the results of preclinical tests along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial within the 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The sponsor must make a separate submission to the existing IND for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Each trial subject must also provide informed consent. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
•Phase 1—the drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence of effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
•Phase 2—trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 registration trials.
•Phase 3—when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 registration trials, Phase 3 registration trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically 
requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with our products, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The NDA Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (currently exceeding $2.8 million for fiscal year 2021) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application must include all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical, preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. An NDA must also contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it files them. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs in 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of 
information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 trials may confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency after approval. The FDA has recently taken the position that under this authority it can require studies with efficacy endpoints in certain circumstances, if, for example, such a study is appropriate to further assess whether a potential lack of expected pharmacological effect, including reduced effectiveness, may result in a serious adverse drug experience. See “—Post-Marketing Requirements” below.
The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the PDUFA review cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, including relevant pediatric data, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or problems the extent or severity of which were unknown may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. We cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires reporting of certain information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non-compliance with FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product's use, require labeling changes, and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the “Orange Book”) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Extension
Patent Term Extension (“PTE”) in the United States can compensate for lost patent grant time during product development and the regulatory review process for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This PTE period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. PTEs that can be obtained are for up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of product approval, whichever is earlier. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents identified in the application for the drug are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been filed with and accepted by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Market Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (“NCE”). A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no 
active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. This means that, in the case of a fixed-dose combination product, the FDA makes the NCE exclusivity determination for each drug substance in the drug product and not for the drug product as a whole. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. For a drug that has been previously approved by the FDA, the FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the new conditions of use and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include in a lengthy review process.
Advertising and Distribution
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. Unless the products were packaged prior to November 27, 2018, the DSCSA requires product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
Manufacturing
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for 
the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the applicant under an approved NDA is subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $330,000 per prescription drug product for fiscal year 2021.
Post-Approval Testing
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must be considered in price reports in order to comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payers.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our products, if any such products or the condition that it is intended to treat is the 
subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our products. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our potential products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with eye-care professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have developed a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,000 and $25,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed in “—Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and 
compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
Numerous U.S. federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, which imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates. In addition, HITECH also gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing these actions. As a result of HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, many U.S. states and foreign governments have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) enacted by the European Union, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to disrupt our operations, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. If there are any violations of these laws, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Government Programs for Marketed Drugs
Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013).
The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, beginning in 2019, Medicare Part D beneficiaries pay 25% of brand drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of a drug approved under an NDA is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D.
Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are 
due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement.
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs. In each year between 2011 and 2018, the aggregate fee for all such manufacturers ranged from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion, and has remained at $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

•As discussed above, effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS expanded Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well, effective April 1, 2020. As the territories were not prepared to implement these changes, the effective date was extended to April 1, 2022. In addition, PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS, beginning in April 2016, also provided for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.
•Effective in 2010, PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication.
•Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019.
•Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
•PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, we will also be required to report on transfers of value to, among others, physician assistants and nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website.
•As of 2010, a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such 
research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
•PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
•PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
There have been ongoing discussions within the U.S. federal government regarding the future of PPACA. There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
European Union
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, our products and product candidates will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Regulatory laws for pharmaceuticals are largely harmonized throughout the European Union, so that applicable E.U. law is most significant and national laws have less importance. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if either a Centralised MA has been obtained from the European Medicines Authority (“EMA”) or national authorisations have been obtained from the competent regulatory agencies.
The various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Phases 1 to 3 of clinical trials in humans are comparable to those regulated in the United States, and GCP requirements in the European Union for these studies follow internationally accepted standards.
Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trial regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals by setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the competent authorities of the Member State in which they occurred. All clinical trials must conform to current GCP guidelines issued by the European Union and the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, in particular when the results of such trials are being used in marketing authorisation procedures, and audits by E.U. inspectors on regulatory conformance of such clinical trials are likely.
In 2014, the new E.U. Clinical Trial Regulation 546/2014 was enacted (the “Regulation”). When it becomes applicable (expected in 2021), it will govern all newly-commenced clinical trials. The new Regulation aims to make more uniform and streamline the clinical trials authorisation process, ensure consistent rules for conducting clinical trials throughout the European Union, increase the efficiency of clinical trials, and increase the transparency of authorization, conduct and results of clinical trials. All clinical trials initiated before the Regulation becomes effective remain subject to the Clinical Trials Directive of 2001.
Generally, in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), for every product candidate, a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) will have to be submitted and approval be obtained, unless a waiver is obtained where justified, in addition to clinical trials conducted in adults. The clinical studies that sponsoring companies must carry out on children are to be set out in detail in the PIP where the indication is one found in children. In most cases, the PIP will become a commitment when applying for a marketing authorisation for a product candidate. A PIP may entail significant cost.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EEA, which is currently comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorisation (“MA”) which is comparable to an NDA in the United States. There are two types of marketing authorisations in the EEA: the Centralised MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the CHMP, a body of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent 
authorities of each Member State of the EEA and only authorizes marketing in that Member State’s national territory and not in the EEA as a whole.
The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. A third alternative system is mutual recognition in which member states “mutually recognize” an authorization already granted in another member state, which shortens the application process.
The EMA is responsible for the validation and scientific evaluation of the application but the European Commission will decide upon our application. The EMA's CHMP will carry out a scientific assessment of the application and will give a recommendation on whether the medicine should be authorized or not. A favorable opinion is accompanied by a draft summary of the product's characteristics, the package leaflet and the proposed text for the packaging.
The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days, subject to extensions if additional questions need to be addressed. Within 15 days of the adoption, the EMA will forward its opinion to the European Commission to start the decision-making phase. Within 15 days a draft implementing decision is sent by the Commission to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, allowing for its scrutiny by E.U. countries. These have 15 days to return their linguistic comments, and 22 days for substantial ones. Once a favorable opinion is reached, the draft decision is adopted via an empowerment procedure. The adoption of the decision should take place within 67 days of the opinion of the EMA. The Commission's Secretariat-General then notifies the marketing authorisation holder of the decision. The decision is subsequently published in the Community Register. In practice, the procedure is expected to take at least one year.
Marketing authorisations are initially valid for five years. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least six months before this five-year period expires. Marketing authorisations lapse if the authorized products are not placed on the market for a period of 3 consecutive years.
In November 2019, we received a Centralised MA for Rhokiinsa®, and in January 2021, we received a Centralised MA for Roclanda®. We will complete a further administrative step to have the Roclanda® authorisation accepted in the United Kingdom, subject to the agreement of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (“MHRA”).
Files Required for Obtaining an E.U. Marketing Authorisation
Similar to the United States, applications for MAs in the European Union must be supported by an extensive dossier that shows the product candidate has the required quality, efficacy and safety suitable for the intended use, and additional administrative documents. The content and format of the dossier must follow the so-called Common Technical Document (“CTD”) format. Amongst other things, the applicant must submit all relevant data from pharmaceutical, pre-clinical and clinical trials, and all relevant information as regards the composition, quality and manufacturing process of the product. These requirements are laid down in applicable E.U. legislation and very detailed EMA guidelines.
In the course of the MAA process, an inspection of the veracity and the compliance of the clinical trials that form the basis of the MAA may be conducted by E.U. inspectors. If it turns out that a clinical trial does not meet GCP and other applicable regulatory standards, it may not serve as a basis for proving efficacy and safety of the product at issue.
Also, the manufacturing sites for the active ingredients of the product candidate may be inspected by the European Union in order to establish that the manufacturing indeed complies with cGMP standards.
Applicants are responsible for ensuring the safety profile of their medicine is adequately characterized at the time of submitting their MAA. Applicants are required to submit a risk management plan as part of their MAA. Risk management plans describe 
existing knowledge on the safety of a medicine and future pharmacovigilance activities designed to further study or monitor the product's safety. Part of that plan will be that a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance is being retained.
Post-approval Obligations of an MA Holder in the European Union
Even after approval of a product candidate by the EC, an MA holder will face various ongoing actions and obligations and must ensure that it has a suitable organization in place that is able to meet these obligations.
Reportable suspected adverse events must be reported to competent authorities via EudraVigilance, a centralized European information system of suspected adverse reactions to medicines. EudraVigilance will re-route the case safety reports to E.U. member states. The EMA will make the reports of individual cases of suspected adverse reactions also available to the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre. Patients and healthcare professionals will continue to report adverse reactions to national competent authorities.
For public health reasons, the EMA may require the MA holder to provide additional data post-authorization, as necessary to provide additional data about the safety and, in certain cases, the efficacy or quality of authorized medicinal products.
The EMA is responsible for harmonizing and coordinating pharmacovigilance inspections at E.U. level, which involves, among others:
•Preparing a risk-based program of routine pharmacovigilance inspections in relation to centrally authorised products.
•Preparing and developing guidance on pharmacovigilance inspections.
•Coordinating advice on the interpretation of pharmacovigilance requirements and related technical issues.
National competent authorities are responsible for coordinating inspections to verify compliance with cGMP, GCP, good laboratory practice and good pharmacovigilance practice within their own territories, and any other aspects of the supervision of authorized medicinal products, subject to laws and guidance provided by the EMA. Where a manufacturing site outside the European Union supplies product in more than one E.U. country, the EMA facilitates cooperation between those concerned competent authorities.
Member States and the Commission must inform other member states, the EMA and the Commission if concerns result from the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities. This may result in the suspension or revocation of the marketing authorisation.
Member states have systems in place which aim at preventing dangerous medicinal products from reaching the patient and cover the receipt and handling of notifications of suspected falsified medicines or quality defects. Rapid alerts must be sent to all member states and a recall may be initiated if such medicines have already reached patients.
An MA holder must:
•Continuously operate a pharmacovigilance system, part of which requires a permanently and continuously available appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance.
•Establish a risk management system, take account of scientific and technical progress and adapt accordingly, and continuously provide the competent authorities with information which might involve amendment of its marketing authorisation.
•Inform the competent authorities of positive and negative results in clinical trials or studies and any defects, and on request have at its disposal details regarding, for example, the volume of sales.
•Ensure that a package information leaflet is made available on request from patients' organizations, in formats appropriate for the blind and partially-sighted.
•Inform the EMA of changes related to the placement of the medicinal product on the market, for example withdrawal or suspension.
Data Exclusivity and Similar Protection in the European Union
An innovator company enjoys a period of “data exclusivity” during which its preclinical and clinical trials data may not be referenced in the regulatory filings of another company (typically a generic company) for the same drug substance. 
The period of data exclusivity in Europe has been harmonized as eight years from the date of first authorization in Europe. There is an additional period of two years of “market exclusivity”. This is the period of time during which a generic company may not market an equivalent generic version of the originator's pharmaceutical product (although their application for authorization may be processed during this period, such that they are in a position to market their product on the expiry of this additional two-year period).
After that ten-year period, generic companies can market their “essentially similar” products by referencing the innovator’s data, unless the innovator product qualifies for a further one year of exclusivity. This additional one year may be obtained if the innovator company is granted an MA for a significant new indication for the relevant medicinal product within the first eight years of its marketing. In such a situation, the generic companies can only market their copy products after 11 years from the grant of the innovator company's initial MA.
Separately, the innovator company may be eligible to receive a Supplementary Protection Certificate (“SPC”). This is an intellectual property right that serves as an extension to a patent right within the scope of the marketing authorisation, comparable to a PTE in the United States. SPCs aim to offset the loss of patent protection for pharmaceutical products that occurs due to the compulsory lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
An SPC can extend an eligible patent right for a maximum of five years. An additional six-month extension is available in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 if the SPC relates to a medicinal product for children for which data has been submitted according to a PIP, as outlined above.
Manufacture of pharmaceuticals in the European Union
As a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products in the European Union, we are subject to extensive E.U. and national legislation that intends to ensure that only safe products will come into circulation. As a manufacturer, we have to comply with GMP. 
Current GMP describes the minimum standard that medicines manufacturers must meet in their production processes. The EMA coordinates inspections to verify compliance with these standards and plays a key role in harmonizing GMP activities at E.U. level. GMP requires that medicines:
•are of consistent high quality;
•are appropriate for their intended use;
•meet the requirements of the marketing authorisation or clinical trial authorization.
GMP in the European Union is based on several E.U. regulations and directives, as well as on extensive EMA guidance. These GMP guidelines provide interpretation of GMP principles and guidelines, supplemented by a series of annexes that modify or augment the detailed guidelines for certain types of product, or provide more specific guidance on a particular topic.
Manufacturers and importers located in the European Union must hold an authorization issued by the national competent authority of the Member State where they carry out these activities. They must show that they comply with E.U. GMP to obtain a manufacturing authorisation.
In the European Union, national competent authorities are responsible for inspecting manufacturing sites located within their own territories. Competent authorities plan routine inspections following a risk-based approach, or if there is suspicion of non-compliance. After inspecting a manufacturing site, E.U. competent authorities issue a GMP certificate or a non-compliance statement, which is entered in a publicly available database (EudraGMDP).
Reimbursement in the European Union
The European Union does not have a centralized healthcare system. Healthcare is provided through very different systems at the national level. Most E.U. citizens have government-sponsored healthcare coverage. Constant budgeting pressures and the jurisdictional divide may lead to delayed or restricted patient access. Generally, the reimbursement prices must be negotiated with national healthcare carriers on a state-by-state process. Therefore, the receipt of a marketing authorisation will not be equivalent to full market access in all E.U. member states. Reimbursement prices may depend on the level of innovation and improvement of patient care that the product brings about, as evaluated, e.g., by public bodies like the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (“IQWiG”) in Germany. It may take one to two years from the issuance of a marketing authorisation before market access in all E.U. member states with full reimbursement is achieved, if at all.
E.U. and national laws impose a number of restrictions on pricing. Directive 89/105/EEC relating to the transparency of measures regulating the prices of medicinal products (“Transparency Directive”) aims to ensure the transparency of national pricing and reimbursement. It sets procedural requirements to help monitor national decisions and their compatibility with pharmaceutical trade in the E.U. internal market. For example, member states must ensure that decisions on prices are made within a certain timeframe and communicated to the applicant with a statement of reason based on objective and verifiable criteria. Member states must also ensure that such decisions are open to an administrative law process for review.
Another important restriction on pricing is Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), which prohibits dominant pharmaceutical companies from abusing this dominance in their relevant markets. 
E.U. Privacy Laws
The GDPR came into effect in the European Union on May 25, 2018 and has changed the way that personal data can be held and processed. Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, amounting to up to 4% of annual global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater.
The GDPR expands and formalizes many rights that existed under former laws. It also requires that organizations inventory their data and document the legal basis for processing personal information. Further, the GDPR provides E.U. data subjects with rights they may exercise in connection with their data such as the “right to be forgotten” and to access to their data.
Generally, personal data of third parties must only be held and used by a company (the “Data Controller”) when covered by an informed consent of the person concerned, or by a legitimate and vital interest, as defined in the GDPR. Any consent must be informed, freely given and specific, and, if applicable, also include the right to transfer personal data to a country outside of the European Union. The Data Controller is responsible for GDPR compliance, but can outsource certain tasks to third parties, so-called “Data Processors”. Affected third parties must be informed in some detail on the storage and use of their data, e.g. as clinical trial subjects, or as prescribers, and have the right to deny their consent.
It is important for companies to ensure they have a nominated data protection officer. They must also brief and train their staff, so they are aware and aligned. Companies should keep records of their approach to GDPR and how they have prepared for it. Preparation should also extend to a response in the event of an access request or complaint from a data subject, or with regards to a GDPR breach.
Brexit
United Kingdom Drug Review and Approval
In the United Kingdom, the drug approval process is currently very similar to the process in the European Union. The United Kingdom is made up of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Due to the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed with the European Union to protect the integrity of trade in the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland is to remain in the E.U. regulatory system for drugs.
The United Kingdom is currently considering how it might develop its regulatory processes since the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), with a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. The MHRA has issued guidance to the effect that products having an E.U. Centralised MA as of the U.K. withdrawal date, i.e. on January 31, 2020, will be grandfathered in the United Kingdom. To this effect and subject to the completion of an administrative process, such E.U. Centralised MAs will be converted by the MHRA into a national U.K. product license. Therefore, we expect Rhokiinsa® will continue to be authorised in the United Kingdom as long as we provide the MHRA with the required additional information. 
For products without Centralised MAs as of January 31, 2020, the option in the United Kingdom is to apply for one of three types of National MAs: the United Kingdom as a whole, Great Britain or Northern Ireland. New centralised applications in the European Union are to be notified to the MHRA together with the timetable and a dossier submitted (because the MHRA does not have access to the E.U. regulatory systems). These applications might until December 31, 2022 be used for a procedurally simplified application for a Great Britain MA through what is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. Because the Centralised MA for Roclanda® was received after December 31, 2020, it is subject to this process. The MHRA will review the EMA decision and have the option to reject the application, although the MHRA is not likely to reject many such applications.
The MHRA is obliged under this procedure to make a decision (positive or negative) within 67 days. Alternatively, a separate application might be made to the MHRA for a Great Britain National MA. Similarly, where the mutual recognition or decentralised process is used in the European Union for applications for national marketing authorisations, there is an option in the United Kingdom to apply under a different reliance procedure, which again requires the MHRA to take a decision within 67 
days. Alternatively, the application in the United Kingdom (or Great Britain) can be made separately from the one in Europe. There are then two options for Northern Ireland – including it either in a European mutual recognition or decentralised application process or as part of a U.K. national application. The assessment made by the United Kingdom is on the same bases as in the European Union, focusing on quality, safety and efficacy.
Reimbursement in the United Kingdom
Reimbursement in the United Kingdom is determined for new medicinal products by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”). NICE reviews health economic data and, in particular, efficacy data in the target population and the cost/ benefit in qualified life years (“QUALY”). If the process runs smoothly there is a 245-day timetable to final decision, although the process can take longer, particularly if there are any appeals. NICE determines whether drug products are recommended for use in the National Health Service (“NHS”) and for which indications and price that the NHS might pay for the product.
The United Kingdom, although no longer covered by GDPR, has included the same rules within its separate national laws.
Japan
Right of Reference
In Japan, clinical trial data collected for obtaining an approval in foreign countries can be used for obtaining an approval for a drug in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the notification by Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (the “MHLW”). The collection of such clinical data and drafting of the submission must meet the requirements under the normal Japanese regulations (Article 43 of the Enforcement Regulations of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Law). The clinical trial data are required to include (i) pharmacodynamics, dose response, efficacy and safety in the foreign countries, (ii) clinical test data clearly exhibiting dose response, efficacy and safety (planned and performed in accordance with Japan rules, such as the Ministerial Ordinance on Good Clinical Practice for Drugs, and GCP; well-managed and using proper test controls; and using proper endpoints, and (iii) pharmacodynamics characteristic in the Japanese population. Further, the MHLW usually requests that a company submit bridging data from testing that is performed in Japan so that the clinical test data in foreign countries are demonstrated to be able to be generalized to the Japanese population. Generally, when the bridging data demonstrate that the dose response, efficacy and safety in Japan are similar to those in the foreign countries, the MHLW recognizes that the test results in the foreign countries can be generalized to the Japanese population. When the dose of the Japanese population in the bridging data is different from that of the test in the foreign countries, the MHLW will request that a company submit pharmacodynamics test results. When the number of samples in the bridging study or studies is limited, the MHLW will request that a company further submit test data demonstrating safety. When the bridging data cannot demonstrate efficacy and safety, the MHLW will request that a company submit clinical test results for the Japanese population. 
Obtaining Approval
In practice, there are three basic ways for a non-Japanese company to obtain approval for pharmaceuticals manufactured overseas:
•Option 1—establish a Japanese corporation that obtains the necessary approvals and licenses. This provides the most durable presence in Japan. It also entails high initial time and expense (including hiring staff) and must be done in compliance with the provisions of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Law.
•Option 2—designate an existing Japanese company to obtain the necessary approvals and licenses. The manufacturing/sales approval for the drug will be registered in the Japanese company's name. This can raise potential problems if the overseas company does not strictly control the Japanese approval holder.
•Option 3—use the designated marketing approval holder (“DMAH”) system under Article 19-2 of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Law and select a Japanese company approved by the MHLW to act as a DMAH. This option provides several benefits, including the manufacturing/sales approval being held directly by the non-Japanese company. In addition, the costs for obtaining/maintaining drug approval are lower than in the first two options. Since the approval is under the non-Japanese company's name, there are fewer concerns about the Japanese company acting on its own. If there are problems with the DMAH, the non-Japanese company can designate another company as the DMAH. Compared with the first option, the costs for a DMAH are lower, since there is no need to establish a new company. DMAHs are authorized by the MHLW, licensed for manufacture/sales of pharmaceuticals and provide full support in the drug approval process.
Japan Privacy Laws
Japan has regulatory provisions for privacy protection for personal information, including of patients in clinical trials. Most importantly, the Act on the Protection of Personal Information covers the protection of personal information. Personal information as used in the Act means information about a living individual that can identify the specific individual by name, date of birth or other description contained in such information (including such information as will allow easy reference to other information and will thereby enable the identification of the specific individual).
Pharmaceutical companies in Japan typically adopt their own internal privacy policies based on this law. The requirements tend to be general and leave a good deal of discretion to individual companies, but typically pharmaceutical companies establish policies covering appropriate safeguarding of personal information, prior consent for disclosure, and protection of personal data from leaks or other unauthorized access or disclosure.
The Clinical Research Act establishing clinical research guidelines, similarly, requires persons conducting clinical studies to obtain informed consent of participants and protect participants’ personal data.
Other Countries
In addition to regulations in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and potentially the United Kingdom, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our potential products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, commercial sales, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, our international operations and relationships with partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors and other agents are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with the FCPA, or similar applicable laws and regulations in other countries, could expose us and our personnel to civil and criminal sanctions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and Human Capital
ESG
We are dedicated to the principles of environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and good corporate governance. We consider these ESG principles to be among our most important values and therefore integrate them in our ongoing and strategic activities. We believe incorporating these values and practices into our operations not only improves our performance but also creates a sustainable and growth-oriented culture that benefits our employees, our customers and our investors. Our Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors regularly reviews our operations with senior management to assess our progress in realizing these values. With our Board of Directors’ leadership, we continue to evaluate our practices and will continue to integrate sustainability into our business.
We recognize our responsibility to be environmentally conscious and to contribute to the global effort of tackling climate change, moving toward a low-carbon economy and expanding our renewable energy production. We employ green processes, materials, practices, equipment and technologies where possible throughout our operations to foster conservation and reduce waste.
Renewable energy is an important part of our commitment to sustainability and we are operating our manufacturing facilities using renewable energy through renewable sources. At our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, we source our energy from Duke Energy, a leader in renewable energy, including solar and wind, and Duke Energy is adding additional renewable solutions such as microgrids and battery storage. At our Athlone manufacturing plant in Ireland we receive 100% of our electricity from renewable sources and the electric supply is 100% carbon neutral.
We minimize energy consumption using various power-saving technologies designed to consume electrical power only when needed. The majority of our office space in the U.S. is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) Certified, and both our manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, and our implant manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, were built from end-to-end with sustainability and good manufacturing practices in mind. We have also instituted environmentally conscious programs into the work environment for our employees by implementing recycling and composting programs, offering water dispensers to reduce plastic bottle waste, and providing electric automobile charging stations in our employee parking areas, as examples. In 2020, we recycled 63% of the non-hazardous waste produced at our Athlone manufacturing plant. Through these programs and continuous improvement, we strive to reduce our waste while maximizing the proportion that may be recycled. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to further enhance our sustainability posture through detailed monitoring and management.
From a social responsibility perspective, although we have not yet attained profitability as a company, we have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to causes that we believe are important to society. These donations were directed to support glaucoma research and glaucoma patient education through ongoing collaborations with the Glaucoma Research Foundation, help fund free cataract surgery for 750 indigent patients in the United States over the past three years through a continuing match program with the American Society of Cataract Refractive Surgery Foundation and promote the empowerment of women in ophthalmology as a lead sponsor of Women in Ophthalmology. In addition, these donations were also directed to accelerate treatments and cures for retinal diseases for the next generation through the Foundation Fighting Blindness and expand opportunities for ophthalmology residents from groups that are underrepresented in medicine or who want to work in underserved communities through support of the National Medical Association’s Rabb-Venable Excellence in Ophthalmology Research Program. We have also made other donations as well as supported causes of interest to areas beyond our immediate scope in eye care, such as a long-standing relationship with Northside Center for Child Development (“NCCD”) and their work with New York City children in need. Our Chief Financial Officer, currently President of the Board of NCCD, has served as a Director since 2009. NCCD has become a pioneer of behavioral health programs for low-income children of color and their families located in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx, New York.
We also strive to be socially conscious in our employment practices. We support diversity in our hiring practices and follow a management philosophy that integrates social responsibility and the highest governance standards. We established an Affirmative Action Plan in 2018 as an Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs compliance requirement. We are committed to make a good faith effort to improve the incumbency of targeted areas over time when the opportunity is available. All managers are trained in Equal Employment Opportunity compliant recruiting and interviewing practices. See “Human Capital—Diversity and Inclusion” below.
Our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has consistently received very high ratings for independence and competency, and our most recent stockholder vote on executive compensation practices received nearly 95% support. As we continue to build our company, we will continue to keep the environment, our social responsibility and governance considerations at top of mind.
Human Capital
In order to successfully attract and retain highly professional and skilled employees, it is crucial that we offer a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace. Our recruitment process begins with hiring individuals that we believe meet our strong culture for respect, commitment, integrity and honesty. We have a philosophy of investing in our employees by providing the necessary resources to grow professionally through our training and development programs, which will ultimately help drive company success. We reward our employees by offering a competitive compensation and benefits package, which includes incentive-based awards, which we believe motivates our employees and drives company performance. We also seek to engage and give back to the community through donations and fundraising for organizations providing help for those with glaucoma, as discussed in “—ESG” above.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 365 full-time employees, of which 299 were employed in the United States and 66 were outside the United States. The majority of our employees outside of the United States primarily support our manufacturing operations in Athlone, Ireland. Of our total employee population, there were 145 sales force and marketing employees, 111 in research and development and medical affairs, 56 in product manufacturing and 53 in general and administrative support roles such as human resources, finance, legal and information technology. We are committed to providing our employees with a positive work environment that helps them realize their full potential and helps them contribute to the success of our company. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We have a strong commitment to continue to build a diverse and inclusive work environment that fosters a positive culture. We believe our diverse workforce brings a wide array of skills and experiences that help increase innovation and strategic thinking and ultimately contribute to the success of our company.
Our hiring practices reflect our commitment to increase diversity and inclusion among our employees. We strive to achieve and maintain pay equity for employees of all races and for both female and male employees within our organization. From a governance perspective, our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion. Approximately a third of our employees in the United States identify as a racial or ethnic minority, with the percentage of minority employees in management reflecting the broader employee population in the United States. The female to male ratio for our total employee population is approximately 50:50.
Talent and Development
The success of our company is highly dependent on the performance, skills and industry knowledge of our employees. A significant proportion of our employee base is comprised of professionals who have had prior experience with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In order to attract and retain such highly qualified talent, we invest significant resources to further develop our employees and provide opportunities that help them achieve career goals and lead our organization.
We maintain a robust training curriculum for all our employees and executives based on function. These curricula incorporate training addressing specific regulatory requirements germane to the performance of specific functions. The training for our scientific and quality personnel, for example, includes modules focusing on our good manufacturing and laboratory practices as well as proper documentation and reporting. In addition to specific function-based training, all of our employees are required to regularly train on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), receive cyber security training and receive harassment training. We believe a well-trained employee base is the best way to ensure proper business operations and to best ensure the establishment of a collaborative and supportive corporate culture.
For example, in keeping with our commitment to the highest standards of honest and ethical behavior and integrity in carrying out our business activities, all of our employees who interact with health care professionals on behalf of our company are required to be trained in, and knowledgeable of, not only our Code but also our Healthcare Compliance Manual (the “HCM”). The HCM is a compendium of our standards intended to not only help ensure continued compliance with the prevailing laws, regulations and standards of our industry, but also to provide a framework for our expectations for employee behavior, operational excellence and risk mitigation to help us achieve our broader organizational goals of discovering and delivering new technologies and safe and efficacious therapies to those in medical need. The HCM builds on the Code and governs how our employees engage with the healthcare community when conducting promotional activities and scientific exchanges as well as financial interactions. All such employees or those in areas who support those activities are required to follow these policies.
Health and Safety
We are dedicated to creating and maintaining a work environment where are our employees feel safe to carry on their responsibilities. We regularly review health and safety legislation to ensure compliance with current standards, we identify and monitor potential health and safety hazards, we coordinate emergency and fire drills and we train our employees to avoid or minimize any potential risks within the workplace. The health and safety of our employees, patients, prescribers and community are of utmost importance during this time and we are complying with all requirements and mandates from various agencies and governments. We value the patient volunteers who participate in clinical trials and we are committed to protecting their rights and well-being. As such, we have policies and procedures in place to ensure our clinical trial practices comply with laws and regulations in all countries in which we operate clinical trials and meet our high ethical standards. We also have protocols in place to obtain informed consent from patients participating in our clinical trials.
In our research and manufacturing facilities, we maintain a safety culture and seek to eliminate workplace incidents and minimize risks and hazards. We have created and implemented processes to help eliminate safety events by reducing their frequency and severity. These programs include an Illness and Injury Prevention Program and a Safety Committee. We also review and monitor our performance closely. We monitor and constantly seek to reduce safety incidents each year. Through our efforts, we had a recordable incident rate of 1.3 (recordable incidents per 100 employees, as defined by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, “OSHA”) at our Athlone manufacturing plant in 2020. This compares to an OSHA incident rate of 1.6 for the U.S. pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing industry in 2019.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking precautionary measures to protect our employees and our stakeholders by adapting company policy to maintain the continuity of our business. We have adapted our facilities and work practices and implemented all necessary safety controls in line with government health policy guidelines. We have formed interdisciplinary 
teams to (i) focus on company-wide communication about the COVID-19 pandemic, including initiatives implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business and (ii) discuss, recommend and supervise the implementation of physical measures at our sites to best ensure employee safety. For example, to further support our employees at the Athlone manufacturing plant, we rolled out a Wellbeing Program to boost communication, engagement and wellness initiatives. With precautionary measures implemented company-wide, we continue to operate effectively as most of our manufacturing plant personnel are working on site and the balance of our total workforce is primarily working from home. Especially important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide all of our employees with excellent healthcare benefits and we make every effort to provide high levels of coverage at the most affordable cost possible.
Compensation and Benefits
To compete in a highly competitive job market and attract, retain and reward outstanding talent, we offer our employees a comprehensive compensation package which includes competitive salaries and benefit programs. Our well-designed compensation package includes salaries, annual bonuses, equity compensation, 401(k) plan with 401(k) plan match, premium health and dental insurance, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance. In addition, our generous time off policy includes paid time off, paid sick leave, holidays, personal leave of absence, military leave and family medical leave.
Our equity compensation plans, pursuant to which we may grant stock options, restricted stock and equity-based awards, are designed to align employees’ interests with our stockholders’ interests and motivate effective performance which drives company success. We also adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which substantially all employees may purchase Aerie common stock through payroll deductions and lump sum contributions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock as of the beginning or end of the offering periods.
