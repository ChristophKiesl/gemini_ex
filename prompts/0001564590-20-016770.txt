--------+----------

General
 Ultra Petroleum Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”, “Ultra”, “our”, “we”, or “us”) is an independent exploration and production company focused on developing and producing its long-life natural gas reserves in the Pinedale and Jonah fields of the Green River Basis of southwest Wyoming. The Company was incorporated in 1979, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Ultra remains a Canadian company, and since March 2000, has operated under the laws of Yukon, Canada pursuant to Section 190 of the Yukon Business Corporations Act. 
 The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to such reports and all other filings pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available free of charge to the public on the Company’s website at www.ultrapetroleum.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

 Oil and Gas Properties Overview 
 Principal Operating Area
 The Company conducts operations exclusively in the United States.  Its operations in southwest Wyoming have historically focused on producing and developing its long-life natural gas reserves in a tight gas sand trend located in the Green River Basin. The Company targets sands of the upper Cretaceous Lance Pool in the Pinedale and Jonah fields. The Lance Pool, as administered by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”), includes sands of the Lance formation at depths between approximately 8,000 and 12,000 feet and the Mesaverde formation at depths between approximately 12,000 and 14,000 feet. As of December 31, 2019, Ultra owned interests in approximately 117,000 gross (83,000 net) acres in Wyoming covering approximately 190 square miles.  Following the sale of the Company’s Pennsylvania properties in late 2017 and Utah assets in late 2018, all oil and gas operations are now focused in the Pinedale and Jonah fields.
Mission and Strategy
 Ultra’s mission and strategy is focused on disciplined capital allocation decisions, generating operating cash flows, reducing its indebtedness, and preserving future potential drilling inventory for more constructive natural gas prices.  The Company’s emphasis on these elements is critically relevant as the natural gas commodity price has eroded further over the course of 2019, and the forward strip pricing remains at depressed levels.  Given Ultra’s focus on profitability and generating operating cash flows to repay its indebtedness, the Company elected to suspend drilling operations in the third quarter of 2019, as the investment returns were unattractive in the current commodity price environment.  The Company determined it is in the best interest of its stakeholders to retain core personnel necessary in order to operate its prolific asset base safely, efficiently, and profitably; to ensure necessary regulatory and environmental compliance; to continue to fulfill its obligations as a public reporting company; to continue to dedicate appropriate resources to studying the underlying geologic and subsurface in order to maximize the value of the Pinedale and Jonah fields; and to prepare to resume a drilling program with much of the historical knowledge and intellectual property developed over many years by Ultra personnel.   
 Due to the suspension of the drilling program, the Company has no estimated proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves as of December 31, 2019, with respect to its properties because it has elected not to drill new wells in the current commodity price environment. Additionally, as noted below, the Company has a $5 million limitation of capital expenditures per quarter as set forth in the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Company previously reported estimated PUD reserves in annual SEC filings, and, if in the future we can satisfy the reasonable certainty criteria as prescribed under the SEC requirements, we could include PUD reserves in future filings.
 Liability Management Activities.  In 2019, Ultra continued its liability management activities. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company executed incremental note exchange transactions of $44.6 million of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) of Ultra Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ultra Resources”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for $27.0 million of new 9.00% Cash / 2.00% PIK Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due July 2024 (the “Second Lien Notes”) (such transaction, the “Incremental Exchange”).  
 The Company also attempted to exchange a portion of the outstanding 7.125% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) of Ultra Resource, for new 9.00% Cash / 2.50% PIK Senior Secured Third Lien Notes due 2024 of Ultra Resources, as allowed by the current Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and Second Lien Indenture (as defined below).  The Company ultimately terminated this exchange offer in July 2019, as it determined the economic terms and the additional layer of secured indebtedness were not in the best interest of the Company.   
 In February and March 2020, the Company entered into confidentiality agreements and commenced discussions with certain holders of the Company’s long-term debt and their legal and financial advisors.  The Company previously engaged with certain debtholders regarding 
 3


potential out-of-court restructuring, but as previously disclosed on March 5, 2020, such negotiations are no longer occurring.  Negotiations and discussions with certain other debtholders and their advisors are now ongoing regarding a potential in-court restructuring, although as of the date of this filing no definitive agreements have been reached regarding any amendments, restructurings or other transactions relating to the Company’s indebtedness.
If an agreement is reached and the Company pursues a restructuring, it may be necessary for the Company to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in order to implement an agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy proceedings.  The Company also may conclude that it is necessary to initiate proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to implement a restructuring of its obligations even if it is unable to reach an agreement with its creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring.  In either case, such a proceeding could be commenced in the near term.
 As discussed under Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company believes it will require a significant restructuring of its balance sheet in order to continue as a going concern in the long term as a result of extremely challenging current market conditions.  The Company has based this belief on assumptions and estimates which are to some degree subjective and may vary considerably from actual results, and it could spend its available financial resources less or more rapidly than currently expected.
 Strategic Alternatives.  As announced in November 2019, the Company previously engaged Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. as an advisor to assist management and the Board of Directors in evaluating a range of strategic alternatives, including without limitation, a corporate sale, merger or other business combination, one or more strategic acquisitions or divestitures, or other transactions. The Company terminated this engagement in the first quarter of 2020, but may elect to reengage this advisor at a later date. 
 The Company continues to explore a number of other potential actions in order to address its liquidity and balance sheet issues, including, among other things, amendments and waivers. 
 There is no assurance that these initiatives will result in a transaction that is accretive to the per share value of the Company. The Company has not set a timetable for the evaluation process and is continuing to evaluate the opportunities to resume a capital program on a more diversified regional basis or to be a consolidator with other operators, subject to increasing commodity prices. 
 
Commodity Price Volatility.  Beginning in March 2020, oil and natural gas commodity prices have experienced extreme volatility primarily attributable to decreased demand resulting from COVID and the actions of OPEC and other oil exporting nations. These events have limited our ability to execute on our business plan and adversely affected our business. Please see “Risk Factors-- Outbreaks of communicable diseases could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “--The ability or willingness of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on oil and natural gas commodity prices.”
 Oil and Gas Development Portfolio.  Ultra seeks to maintain a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects.  The Company evaluates opportunities for the acquisition, exploration, and development of additional oil and natural gas properties that afford risk-adjusted returns in excess of or equal to its current set of investment alternatives. 
 Focus on Maximizing Value.  Ultra strives to maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry in terms of both producing and adding oil and natural gas reserves.  In 2019, the Company continued to focus on improving its drilling and production results using advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of its properties, while maintaining its low-cost structure, adhering to industry and regulatory best practices, maintaining strict safety and environmental standards, and recruiting and retaining top talent within the Company.  This is evidenced by the Company’s low-cost operations, the improvement in well costs, and the advancement of lower-cost drilling processes that served to enhance investment returns in 2019.  
Credit Agreement Activity 
 Ultra Resources entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) as the borrower with the Company and UP Energy Corporation, as parent guarantors, with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the “RBL Administrative Agent”), and with the other lenders party thereto from time to time (collectively, the “RBL Lenders”), providing for a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) subject to a borrowing base redetermination, which limits the aggregate amount of first lien debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Agreement (as defined below).
 During 2019, the Company met all of its financial obligations, including debt service and interest obligations, and was in compliance with the requirements of its various debt instruments.  The Company proactively negotiated amendments to its Credit Agreement twice during 2019 which aligned with the stated goals of directing cash flows to reduce indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a commitment of $200.0 million under its Revolving Credit Facility and a borrowing base of $1.175 billion, of which $64.7 million was outstanding. Additionally, the Company had $6.7 million of letters of credit outstanding. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is defined as the undrawn portion of the commitment, plus the unrestricted cash of the Company, and net of any outstanding letters of credit. 
 4


On February 14, 2020, Ultra Resources entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) with the RBL Administrative Agent and the RBL Lenders party thereto.  Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment and the spring 2020 redetermination, the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was reduced to $1.075 billion, with $100 million attributed to the Revolving Credit Facility, effective on April 1, 2020.  The Sixth Amendment also reduced the excess cash threshold to $15 million as part of the anti-cash hoarding provisions and established quarterly, rather than semi-annual, redeterminations of the borrowing base. The next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to be completed on or before July 1, 2020.  
 Given the potential for decreases in future commodity prices, the borrowing base level is subject to redetermination risk.  If the borrowing base or the commitment amount were redetermined below the levels of outstanding indebtedness associated with the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Agreement, or if the commitment amount was inadequate to fund ongoing operations, the Company could potentially trigger mandatory repayment provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility or demands to reduce the Term Loan Agreement balance.  Given the overall credit metrics of the Company and the state of the debt markets, such a situation could result in the Company having an event of default under its debt obligations.
 The report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies its audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  As a result, the Company has reclassified all of its total outstanding debt as current.  Because the audit report prepared by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to its ability to continue as a going concern, the Company is in default under each of the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement on April 14, 2020 when the Company delivers its financial statements to the lenders under the Credit Agreement. There is a 30-day grace period related to this covenant in the Credit Agreement. If the Company does not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Agreement before the expiration of the 30-day grace period, an event of default under each of the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement would occur. As a result of the going concern qualification in the independent registered public accounting firm’s report to the December 31, 2019 financial statements,  the Company’s immediate liquidity is limited to cash as it will not have access to its Revolving Credit Facility beginning on April 15, 2020.  
 See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a description of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt instruments.
 2018 and 2017 Divestitures
 The Company previously had operations in the Uinta Basin in Utah and in north central Pennsylvania. 
 During the third quarter of 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Utah assets for net cash proceeds of $69.3 million, including transaction fees of $0.6 million. The divested assets consisted primarily of oil and gas properties.  Prior to the sale, production from the Company’s Utah assets totaled approximately 420,000 Bbl of oil and 745,000 Mcf of natural gas in 2018. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company divested its properties in the Pennsylvania Devonian aged Marcellus Shale, for net cash proceeds of approximately $115.0 million. Prior to the sale, production from the Pennsylvania assets totaled approximately 11.2 million Mcf of natural gas in 2017.
 Exploration and Production
 See Item 2. “Properties” for a description of our properties. 
 Green River Basin, Wyoming
 During 2019, the Company completed and turned to sales 93 gross (77.6 net) vertical and 1 gross (0.9 net) horizontal wells operated by the Company and others in Wyoming and continued to improve its drilling and completion efficiency on its operated wells. Of these wells, the Company operated 71 gross (70.3 net) vertical wells and 1 gross (0.9 net) horizontal wells.  In line with the Company’s commitment to make its operations more efficient, the Company’s development was focused on vertical wells in 2019. The operated well costs for vertical wells declined since 2017 to $2.87 million per well during third quarter 2019 at which time the Company suspended its drilling operations. The decline of well costs in 2019 is a result of an increased success rate of the two-string drilling design over the year, as well as overall improvements in efficiencies and cost management throughout the year. Included in the well results was the successful completion of seven wells with the two-string design in third quarter 2019 at an average well cost of $2.65 million per well, highlighting improvement of the selection of the locations for this application in the Pinedale Field, as well as the knowledge gained over the course of the year as to the application of the techniques deployed.  The Company operates 92% of its production in the Pinedale field.  
 During 2020, the Company plans to continue its focus on cash flow generation and reduction of indebtedness.  Development activity may occur if there is a sustained increase in the expected realized natural gas price and the Company amends it Credit Agreement to remove the limitation of capital investments to amounts below $5.0 million per quarter, which was implemented in connection with the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement on September 16, 2019 (the “Fifth Amendment”).

Marketing and Pricing
 Overview
 During the year ended December 31, 2019, Ultra derived its revenues from the sale of its natural gas and associated condensate produced from wells operated by the Company in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming and ownership interests in wells operated by another operator in the same area.
 During 2019, 96% of the Company’s production and 86% of its revenues were attributable to natural gas, with the balance attributable to associated condensate and crude oil. 
 The Company’s natural gas and oil revenues are determined by prevailing market prices in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, specifically, southwest Wyoming, as virtually all of its natural gas is sold at the Inside FERC First of Month Index for Northwest Pipeline — Rocky Mountains (“NwRox”). The NwRox and New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) is the price that is reflective of the Company’s gas sold in the Opal, Wyoming area.
 The NwRox price can be volatile, particularly in peak winter and summer periods, as evidenced in December 2019 when natural gas at that delivery point was selling for $0.97 per MMBtu above NYMEX pricing for natural gas.  During 2019, the negative differential of NwRox to Henry Hub averaged $0.04 per MMBtu, with a range of negative $0.74 per MMBtu to a positive differential of $0.97 per MMBtu for first of month Inside FERC basis at Opal.
 Natural Gas Marketing
 Ultra currently sells all its natural gas production to a diverse group of third-party, non-affiliated entities in a portfolio of transactions of various durations and prices (daily, monthly and longer term). The Company’s customer base includes a significant number of customers situated in the various regions of the United States. The sale of the Company’s natural gas is “as produced”. 
 Midstream services.    For its natural gas production in Wyoming, the Company has entered into various gathering and processing agreements with midstream service providers that gather, compress and process natural gas owned or controlled by the Company from its producing wells in the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah fields. Under these agreements, the midstream service providers continue to maintain and upgrade the facilities in southwest Wyoming to ensure reliability and certainty of operations. The Company believes that the capacity of the midstream infrastructure related to its production will continue to be adequate to allow it to sell all its available natural gas production.
 Basis differentials.    The market price for natural gas is influenced by a number of regional and national factors which are beyond the Company’s ability to control. These factors include, among others, weather in the western United States, natural gas supplies, imports from Canada, natural gas demand, inventory levels in natural gas storage fields, and natural gas pipeline capacity to export gas from the basins where the Company’s production is located. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information about risks to our financial condition and business results associated with basis differentials.
 The Rocky Mountain region is a net exporter of natural gas because local natural gas production exceeds local demand, especially during non-winter months. As a result, natural gas production in southwest Wyoming has from time to time sold at a discount relative to other U.S. natural gas production sources or market areas. These regional pricing differentials, or discounts, are typically referred to as “basis” or “basis differentials” and are reflective, to some extent, of (i) the costs associated with transporting the Company’s gas to markets in other regions or states, and (ii) the availability of pipeline capacity to move the Company’s gas to market.
 Following the completion of the Rockies Express and Ruby pipelines, the average annual basis for NwRox averaged 5.6% below Henry Hub from 2012 through 2016. The additional capacity of these two pipelines has had a significant positive impact on the value that the Company receives for its natural gas production in southwest Wyoming, as compared to prior years when constraints were prevalent in the region. However, from 2017 to 2018, NwRox basis weakened from levels realized in 2012 through 2016 mainly due to weakening fundamentals in the Company’s core delivery area, California, and increasing flows from regions that produce significant quantities of oil and are connected by gas pipelines to the California market. In 2019, NwRox basis improved to average 98.6% of Henry Hub due increased demand and reduced supply in Western US markets. What has become more pronounced over the last several years is a widening and favorable distinction between natural gas priced based on NwRox compared to Colorado Interstate Gas (“CIG”).  Over the course of 2019, NwRox outperformed CIG by approximately $0.45 per MMBtu with CIG pricing at 81.6% of Henry Hub.
 While trades indicate that the basis differentials for the forward-looking basis market for 2020 and 2021 are negative to Henry Hub by approximately $0.23 per MMBtu and $0.36 per MMBtu, respectively, the winter seasons of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 demonstrate the potential for NwRox basis to trade at a significant premium to Henry Hub during the winter seasons. The actual results for January and February 2020 were positive by $1.00 per MMBtu and $0.07 per MMBtu, respectively.

The table below provides a historical perspective on average quarterly basis differentials for Wyoming natural gas (NwRox). The basis differential is expressed as a percentage of the Henry Hub price as reported by Inside FERC Report from S&P and Platt’s M2M (Mark to Market) Report on December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

NYMEX (per MMBtu) | $ | 3.00 | | | $ | 2.80 | | $ | 2.90 | | $ | 3.64 | 

Oil Marketing
 Wyoming.    The Company markets its Wyoming condensate to various purchasers, which are primarily refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The Company’s condensate realized pricing is typically based on New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures daily settlement prices, adjusted for a negotiated location/transportation differential. All of the Company’s condensate sales are denominated in U.S. dollars per barrel and are paid monthly. The Company routinely maintains only operating inventories of condensate production and sells its product on an “as produced” basis. A portion of the Company’s condensate sales are entered into by its operating partners in the Pinedale field. Over 93% of oil is transported via pipeline, thereby greatly reducing the cost of transportation. During 2019, the Company realized a positive differential of $2.83 per Bbl, to a West Texas Intermediate price. The improvement in the differential was a result of strong refining demand for the quality of condensate produced in the Pinedale area. This trend of strengthening oil differentials is expected to continue in 2020, as evidence by the contracts in place through 2020 at a positive differential of $3.74 per Bbl. With the drastic drop in demand for Refined Products due to the response to COVID-19, Salt Lake area refineries may reduce their demand for Crude Oil.  There is a risk that regional storage for Crude Oil may be insufficient for area producers including Ultra to continue full production rates in the second quarter of 2020. Please see “Risk Factors-- Outbreaks of communicable diseases could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “--The ability or willingness of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on oil and natural gas commodity prices.”
 Derivatives
 The Company, from time to time and in the regular course of its business, enters into hedges for volumes equivalent to a portion of expected future production volumes, primarily through the use of financial swaps, collars and puts with creditworthy financial counterparties (See Note 8 for additional information), or through the use of fixed price, forward sales of physical product. Under the Company’s Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to minimum hedging requirements through March 31, 2020, after which there is no minimum hedging requirement from the lenders. During the quarterly period beginning on September 30, 2019 and ending on March 31, 2020, the Company was required to hedge a minimum of 50% of projected proved developed producing natural gas reserve volumes projected to be produced in the specified quarter.
 The Company considers the requirements of the Credit Agreement when developing its hedging policy.  The Company’s management and board of directors has a Hedge Committee that reviews the forecast production, the requirements under the Credit Agreement, and the market outlook to determine the timing and the manner in which to hedge with the underlying goal to provide a predictable level of cash flow while preserving some flexibility to participate in upward price movements.
 Major customers
 A major customer is defined as one that individually accounts for 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during the year. In 2019, sales to Nevada Power Company and Pacific Gas and Electric accounted for 11.1% and 10.2% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2018 and 2017, the Company had no single customer
 that represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.
 The Company maintains credit policies intended to mitigate the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable related to the sale of natural gas and condensate as well as commodity derivatives. A more complete description of the Company’s credit policies is described in Note 15. The Company takes measures to ensure collectability with its purchasers through regular credit monitoring and reviews.  As necessary, the Company requires prepayment, letters of credit or parental guarantees from its purchasers for the periods of exposure.  The Company did not have any outstanding, uncollectible accounts for its natural gas and oil sales at December 31, 2019. 
 Regulatory Matters
 The Company’s oil and gas operations are subject to a number of regulations. Governing agencies may include one or more of the following levels: federal, regional, state, county, municipality, Tribal or other public entities. In general, the purposes of these regulations are to 
 7


prevent waste of oil and natural gas resources, protect the rights of surface and mineral owners, regulate interstate transportation of oil and gas, and to govern environmental quality. Common forms of regulations may include:
  
• | Notification to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nondiscrimination statutes;
--+----------------------------


• | Royalty and related valuation requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | On-site security and bonding requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Location and density of drilling;
--+----------------------------------


• | Method of drilling, completing and operating wells;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Measurement and reporting of oil and gas;
--+------------------------------------------


• | Rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and gas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Production, severance and ad valorem taxes;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Management of produced water and waste; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Surface use, reclamation and plugging and abandonment of wells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 A significant portion of the Company’s operations are located on federal lands in the Pinedale and Jonah Fields of Sublette County, Wyoming. The development activities in these fields are subject to the regulation of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) which is responsible for governing their surface and mineral rights and regulating certain development activities in these fields. As required under the National Environmental Policy Act, an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) was prepared to quantify and address potential impacts of natural gas development in both the Pinedale and Jonah fields. In March 2006, the BLM issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) which provides broad authorization for the development activities currently occurring in the Jonah Area. In September 2008, the BLM issued its ROD that currently governs the development activities in the Pinedale Area. In addition to the overarching authorizations provided by the Jonah and Pinedale RODs, BLM issues site-specific authorizations such as rights of way and permits to drill on an ongoing basis.
 The Pinedale ROD includes some significant components to ensure the orderly and responsible development of natural gas concurrent to minimizing the environmental impact. Some of these components include:
  
• | Year-round operations on multi-wells pads;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Liquid gathering systems to reduce truck traffic and minimize impacts to air quality and wildlife;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring of key wildlife species and mitigation of monitored impacts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced emission reductions including best practices such as controlled drill rigs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spatial progression of development to address specific surface and wildlife issues;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual meeting and long-range planning requirements to allow for socioeconomic predictability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Management to consider current and changing conditions and facilitate common-sense solutions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suspension of flank acreage until core acreage is developed and returned to a functioning habitat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the majority of the Company’s operations in Wyoming are covered by the Pinedale ROD, provisions of the Jonah ROD similarly ensure responsible and orderly development of the Jonah field while minimizing the environmental impact:
  
• | Annual reporting and long-range planning requirements to allow for planned mitigation and socioeconomic predictability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emission reduction report to ensure air quality goals are met;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual water well monitoring reports; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Flareless-completion technology to reduce noise, visual impacts and air emissions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The State of Wyoming maintains governance over some of the more traditional state-regulated matters such as individual well drilling permits, spacing and pooling, wellbore construction, as well as its own regulations on safety and environmental matters. The WOGCC has authorized drilling density up to one well per five acres in the Pinedale field and up to one well per ten acres in the Jonah field.
 Regulations are well documented and the Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with current applicable laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company. However, changes to certain existing regulations are beyond the control of the Company and could introduce uncertainty and additional costs. See Item1A. “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding environmental regulations.
 In December 2018 and January 2019, a portion of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to pass a continuing resolution.  This shut-down included all nonessential personnel at the BLM, including BLM staff tasked with processing drilling permits and sundries.  The Company has adequate inventory of approved applications for permit to drill if and when the Company’s elects to resume its drilling program, 
 8


but any changes or deviations from what is approved in these permits cannot be approved during a shut-down, should another one occur, thus creating an execution risk.  In addition, such government disruptions could delay or halt the granting and renewal of the permits, approvals, and certificates required to conduct our operations.
Mineral Leasing Act
 The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (“Mineral Act”) prohibits ownership of any direct or indirect interest in federal onshore oil and gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign corporation except through stock ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and gas lease can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. The Company’s subsidiaries that own mineral leases qualify as a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory. Although the regulations promulgated and administered by the BLM pursuant to the Mineral Act provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. The Company owns interests in numerous federal onshore oil and gas leases. It is possible that holders of the Company’s equity interests may be citizens of foreign countries that are determined to be non-reciprocal countries under the Mineral Act. In such event, the federal onshore oil and gas leases held by the Company could be subject to cancellation based on such determination.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
 Surface Damage Acts
 Several states, including Wyoming, and some tribal nations have enacted surface damage statutes. These laws are designed to compensate for damages caused by oil and gas development operations. Most surface damage statutes contain entry and negotiation requirements to facilitate contact between the operator and surface owners. Most also contain binding requirements for payments by the operator in connection with development operations. Costs and delays associated with surface damage statutes could impair operational effectiveness and increase development costs.
Environmental Regulations
 General.    The Company’s exploration, drilling and production activities from wells and oil and natural gas facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating or storing oil, natural gas and other products are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality, including those relating to oil spills and pollution control. These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. The oil and gas exploration and production industry has been and continues to be the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities.
 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot be sure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. However, it is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste.    The Company has previously owned or leased and currently owns or leases, numerous properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although the Company utilized standard operating and disposal practices, hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties are or have been operated by third parties over whom the Company has no control, nor has ever had control as to such entities’ treatment of hydrocarbons or other wastes or the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. Under current and evolving law, it is possible the Company could be required to remediate property, including ground water, impacted by operations of the Company or by such third-party operators, or impacted by previously disposed wastes including performing remedial plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing contamination.
 Although oil and gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and some comparable state statutes, it is possible some wastes the Company generates presently are or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA and state analogs, even as non-hazardous wastes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for certain wastes, including hazardous wastes and there is no guarantee that the EPA or the states will not adopt more stringent requirements in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and several environmental groups entered into a consent decree under which the EPA committed to propose new regulations for the management of oil and gas wastes under RCRA Subtitle D (which relates to non-hazardous wastes) or sign a determination that a revision of existing rules is unnecessary. In April 2019, the EPA made the determination that revisions to the regulations were not necessary at that time, concluding that

any adverse effects related to oil and gas waste were more appropriately and readily addressed within the framework of existing state regulatory programs. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from designation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 In addition, current and future regulations governing the handling and disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may affect our operations. For example, in Wyoming any waste material exceeding specified thresholds is subject to controls and guidance by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality Solid and Hazardous Waste Division, which determines how and where NORM wastes will be disposed of.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.    Many of the Company’s exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Congress has periodically considered legislation to amend the SDWA to remove the exemption from permitting and regulation provided to injection for hydraulic fracturing (except where diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid) and to require the disclosure and reporting of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. This type of federal legislation, if adopted, could lead to additional regulation and permitting requirements that could result in operational delays making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance and operating costs.
 In addition, the EPA has issued guidance regarding federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control Program. Further, in December 2016 the EPA released its final report on a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing resources. While no widespread impacts from hydraulic fracturing were found, the EPA identified a number of activities and factors that may have increased risk for future impacts.  Furthermore, a number of public and private studies are underway regarding the connection, if any, between the disposal of waste water associated with hydraulic fracturing and observed seismicity in the vicinity of such disposal operations. These studies and the EPA’s enforcement initiative for the energy extraction sector could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
 Some states, including Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals in the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or well stimulation operations. Additionally, some states, localities and local regulatory districts have adopted or have considered adopting regulations to limit, and in some case impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding permitting, casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Although none of the Company’s properties are in jurisdictions where the moratoria have been imposed, it is possible the jurisdictions where the Company’s properties are located may adopt such limits or other limits on hydraulic fracturing in the future. In December 2017, BLM rescinded regulations that it previously enacted for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands; that rescission has been challenged by several environmental groups and states in ongoing litigation. Further, the EPA has announced an initiative under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and is working on regulations for wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing.
 Finally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of waste has been alleged to cause earthquakes.  In Oklahoma, for example, such issues have led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity.  Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells.  Although our operations are not located in those jurisdictions, any future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection in jurisdictions where we operate could affect our operations.
 Superfund.    Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, liability, generally, is joint and several for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), include current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance, persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at such a facility, and in some cases the parties transporting such hazardous substances to the facility at issue. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases and threats of releases to protect the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRP the costs of such action. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of its operations, adulterated petroleum products containing other hazardous substances have been treated as hazardous substances in the past, and the Company has generated and will generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. The Company may also be an owner or operator of facilities on which hazardous substances have been released. The Company may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages, as a past or present owner or operator or as an arranger. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Many states have comparable laws imposing liability on similar classes of persons for releases, including for releases of materials that may not be included in CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. 
 10


To its knowledge, the Company has not been named a PRP under CERCLA (or any comparable state law) nor have any prior owners or operators of its properties been named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such property.
 National Environmental Policy Act.    NEPA provides that, for federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the federal agency taking such action must prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) or an EIS. In the EIS, the agency is required to evaluate alternatives to the proposed action and the environmental impacts of the proposed action and of such alternatives. Actions of the Company, such as drilling on federal lands, to the extent the drilling requires federal approval, may trigger the requirements of the NEPA, including the requirement that an EA or EIS be prepared. The requirements of the NEPA may result in increased costs, significant delays and the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company’s activities, including but not limited to the restricting or prohibiting of drilling. Moreover, in January 2020, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) proposed changes to NEPA regulations designed to overhaul the system and speed up federal agencies’ approval of projects. Among other things, the rule proposes to narrow the definition of “effects” to exclude the terms “direct,” “indirect,” and “cumulative” and redefine the term to be “reasonably foreseeable” and having “a reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action or alternatives.” Changes to the NEPA regulations could impact our operations and our ability to obtain governmental permits. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business
 Oil Pollution Act.    The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns liability, which generally is joint and several, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and for a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses and limitations exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, the Company could be liable for costs and damages.
 Clean Air Act.    The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws regulate air emissions from stationary and mobile sources and establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six criteria pollutants. The CAA is a federal law, but states, tribes and local governments do much of the work to develop EPA-approved plans to achieve these standards and meet the CAA’s requirements. Federal and state laws generally require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction, which may require, among other things, stringent emission controls. Administrative agencies can bring actions for failure to comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, which may result in fines, injunctive relief and imprisonment.
 The New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs under the CAA impose specific requirements affecting the oil and gas industry for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, completions and certain other equipment. Periodic review and revision of these rules by federal and state agencies may require changes to our operations, including possible installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business.
 In June 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector; however, in September 2018, under a new administration, the EPA proposed to remove transmission and storage activities from the purview of the rules, thereby rescinding the VOC and methane emissions limits applicable to those activities. The proposed rule would also rescind the methane limit emissions for production and processing sources but would maintain emissions limits for VOCs. In the alternative, the EPA also proposed to simply rescind the methane requirements for all oil and natural gas sources, without removing any activities from the source category. Similarly, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of regulations it had previously enacted to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands; California and New Mexico have challenged that rule in ongoing litigation.  In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending (as of October 2019, the EPA had requested a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of its proposed overhaul of the 2016 methane requirements). Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements and cause major delays in construction, effectively depressing new development. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development, which could be significant.
 Clean Water Act.    The CWA and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters and waters of the United States, a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Under the CWA, permits must be obtained for the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The CWA provides for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants, oil, and hazardous substances and also imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities.
 11


The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit. In June 2015, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) issued new rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction over wetlands (the “Clean Water Rule”). The Clean Water Rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule lies with the federal district courts, and the Sixth Circuit’s stay was dissolved in February 2018. On July 27, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to rescind the Clean Water Rule and re-codify the regulatory text that existed prior to 2015 defining the “waters of the United States.” In December 2018, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule revising the WOTUS definition that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular water body meets any of those classifications. In October 2019, the EPA issued a final rule repealing the Clean Water Rule (which became effective in December 2019 and already has been challenged in federal district courts in New Mexico, New York, and South Carolina). In January 2020, the EPA announced a final rule redefining “waters of the United States.” Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the final revision rule. To the extent the repeal and revision rules are successfully challenged, and the Clean Water Rule is enforced in jurisdictions in which we operate or a replacement rule expands the scope of the CWA jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.  
 Also, in 2016, the EPA finalized new wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works. This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
 Endangered Species Act.    The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), and special protections are provided to bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Company conducts operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases that have species, such as raptors, that are listed and species, such as sage grouse, that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA.  On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary for over 250 species.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a 7-Year National Listing Workplan in September 2016. However, on July 25, 2018, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed three revisions to regulations regarding critical habitat designation, interagency cooperation, and protection of threatened species that it believes are necessary to address industry and landowner concerns. The U.S. Department of the Interior also issued an opinion on December 22, 2017 that would narrow certain protections afforded to migratory birds pursuant to the MBTA. In response to this opinion, two separate lawsuits were filed on May 24, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the Department of the Interior’s interpretation of the MBTA. On September 5, 2018, eight states also filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the opinion. All such litigation is ongoing. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
 Climate Change Legislation.    More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), including methane and carbon dioxide, may be adopted and could cause the Company to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions.  Although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements as applicable to GHG emissions, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA has established GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. The Company has submitted all required annual reports to date. Although the rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it could require us to incur significant costs to monitor, keep records of, and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.
 In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. Cap and trade programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States was one of 175 countries to sign an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that requires member countries to set their own GHG emission reduction goals beginning in 2020. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and on November 4, 2019, the U.S. submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations.  The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification, although there is a possibility that a new administration could choose to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Various states and local governments have vowed to continue to enact regulations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Any legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.  Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced by our customers or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
 Worker Safety.    The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and analogous state laws regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. For example, under a new OSHA standard limiting respirable silica exposure, the oil and gas industry must implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Labor announced a plan to more frequently and effectively prosecute worker health and safety violations, including enhanced penalties.
 The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 151 full-time employees, including officers. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 
 Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the drilling and producing activities and other operations in the areas in which the Company operates.  These seasonal conditions can pose challenges for meeting the well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.  For example, the Company’s operations may be impacted by ice and snow in the winter and by electrical storms and high temperatures in the spring and summer, as well as by wild fires in the fall.
 The demand for natural gas typically decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months.  Seasonal anomalies sometimes lessen or amplify this fluctuation.  In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.  As a corollary, the demand for our products can be impacted by weather in the western United States from temperature fluctuations outside of normal ranges, moisture levels in the Pacific Northwest to the extent it impacts hydroelectric power generation, and more broadly across the United States when there are unusual cold events or lack of winter weather.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies in our industry that have more extensive resources than we do or that may have other competitive advantages or disadvantages.  We compete with other companies in the acquisition of properties, in the search for and development of reserves, in the production and sale of natural gas and crude oil, and for the labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.  Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies, and individual producers and operators.
Principal Executive Offices
 The Company is incorporated under the laws of Yukon, Canada, with headquarters in Englewood, Colorado.  The principal executive offices are located at 116 Inverness Drive East, Suite 400, Englewood, Colorado, 80112.  The main telephone number is (303) 708-9740.
