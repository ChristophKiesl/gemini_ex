Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an established leader and fully integrated provider of innovative imaging diagnostics, targeted therapeutics, and artificial intelligence solutions to Find, Fight and Follow serious medical conditions. For our imaging diagnostics, we believe that the resulting improved diagnostic information enables healthcare providers to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, potentially achieving improved patient outcomes, reducing patient risk and limiting overall costs for payers and the entire healthcare system.
Our commercial products are used by cardiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, radiologists, oncologists, internal medicine physicians, technologists and sonographers working in a variety of clinical settings. We sell our products to radiopharmacies, PET manufacturing facilities (“PMFs”), integrated delivery networks, hospitals, clinics and group practices.
We sell our products globally and operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:
•U.S. Segment produces and markets our agents and products throughout the U.S. In the U.S., we primarily sell to radiopharmacies, PMFs, integrated delivery networks, hospitals, clinics and group practices.
•International Segment operations consist of direct distribution in Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as third-party distribution relationships in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and our EXINI business in Sweden.
We are in the process of evaluating our operating and reporting structure. We anticipate this evaluation, which we expect to complete during 2021, may result in a change to our existing operating segment reporting structure.
Progenics Acquisition 
On June 19, 2020, we completed the Progenics Acquisition. Progenics is an oncology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative targeted medicines and artificial intelligence to Find, Fight and Follow cancer. Progenics’ portfolio of products and product candidates includes, among other things, therapeutic agents designed to target cancer (AZEDRA, 1095 and PSMA TTC), diagnostic imaging agents designed to target PSMA for prostate cancer (PyL and 1404), RELISTOR for opioid-induced constipation (“OIC”), artificial intelligence (“AI”) imaging technologies and leronlimab being developed for HIV infection and COVID-19 applications. Progenics’ current revenue is generated from two principal sources: first, royalties, development and commercial milestones from strategic partnerships, including royalties from Bausch from sales of RELISTOR; and second, AZEDRA sales. 
Lantheus Holdings issued 26,844,877 shares of Lantheus Holdings common stock and 86,630,633 CVRs to former Progenics stockholders in connection with the Progenics Acquisition. Lantheus Holdings also assumed 34,000 in-the-money Progenics stock options and 6,507,342 out-of-the-money Progenics stock options, each converted into Replacement Stock Options at an exchange ratio of 0.31.

Our Portfolio of Commercial Products
Our commercial products now include the following:
•DEFINITY is a microbubble ultrasound enhancing agent used in ultrasound exams of the heart, also known as echocardiography exams. DEFINITY contains perflutren-containing lipid microspheres and is indicated in the U.S. for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to assist in imaging the left ventricular chamber and left endocardial border of the heart in ultrasound procedures. In November 2020, the FDA approved our supplemental new drug application (“sNDA”) for DEFINITY RT. DEFINITY RT is a modified formulation of DEFINITY that allows both storage and shipment at room temperature (DEFINITY’s previously approved formulation requires refrigerated storage). We believe we are currently the leading provider of ultrasound microbubble enhancing agents in the world.
•TechneLite is a Technetium (“Tc-99m”) generator that provides the essential nuclear material used by radiopharmacies to radiolabel Cardiolite, Neurolite and other Tc-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine procedures. TechneLite uses Mo-99 as its active ingredient.
•NEUROLITE is an injectable, Tc-99m-labeled imaging agent used with SPECT technology to identify the area within the brain where blood flow has been blocked or reduced due to stroke.
•RELISTOR (methylnaltrexone bromide) is a treatment for OIC that decreases the constipating side effects induced by opioid pain medications such as morphine and codeine without diminishing their ability to relieve pain. RELISTOR is approved in two forms: a subcutaneous injection and an oral tablet.
•Xenon-133 (“Xenon”) is a radiopharmaceutical gas that is inhaled and used to assess pulmonary function and also to image cerebral blood flow. Our Xenon is manufactured by a third party as a bi-product of Mo-99 production and is processed and finished by us. We believe we are currently the leading provider of Xenon in the U.S.
•Cardiolite, also known by its generic name sestamibi, is an injectable, Tc-99m-labeled imaging agent used in myocardial perfusion imaging (“MPI”) procedures to assess blood flow to the muscle of the heart using SPECT. Cardiolite was approved by the FDA in 1990 and its market exclusivity expired in July 2008. Included in Cardiolite revenues are branded Cardiolite and generic sestamibi revenues.
•Gallium-67 (“Gallium”) is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used to detect certain infections and cancerous tumors, especially lymphoma. We manufacture Gallium using cyclotron technology.
•Thallium-201 (“Thallium”) is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used in MPI studies to detect cardiovascular disease. We manufacture Thallium using cyclotron technology.
•AZEDRA (iobenguane I 131) is a radiotherapeutic, approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who require systemic anticancer therapy. AZEDRA is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this indication. 
•QUADRAMET is an injectable radiopharmaceutical used to treat severe bone pain associated with osteoblastic metastatic bone lesions. We serve as the direct manufacturer and supplier of QUADRAMET in the U.S.
•Automated Bone Scan Index (“aBSI”) calculates the disease burden of prostate cancer by quantifying the hotspots on bone scans and automatically calculating the bone scan index value, representing the disease burden of prostate cancer shown on the bone scan. This quantifiable and reproducible calculation of the bone scan index value is intended to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of men with prostate cancer and may have utility in monitoring the course of the disease. The Japanese rights to the stand-alone aBSI have been transferred and sold to FUJIFILM Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. (“FUJIFILM”) under the name BONENAVI®. The cloud based aBSI was made available for clinical use in the U.S. on August 5, 2019. In February 2020, Progenics received CE marking for the standalone workstation model of aBSI, meeting the quality standards set by the European Economic Area. In September 2020, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the use of aBSI on a GE Healthcare system.
•Cobalt (Co 57) is a non-pharmaceutical radiochemical used in the manufacture of sources for the calibration and maintenance of SPECT imaging cameras.
Sales of our microbubble ultrasound enhancing agent, DEFINITY, are made in the U.S. and Canada through a DEFINITY direct sales team. In the U.S., our nuclear imaging products, including TechneLite, Xenon, NEUROLITE and Cardiolite, are primarily distributed through commercial radiopharmacies, the majority of which are controlled by or associated with Cardinal, RLS (previously GE Healthcare), UPPI, Jubilant Radiopharma and PharmaLogic. A small portion of our nuclear imaging product sales in the U.S. are made through our direct sales force to hospitals and clinics that maintain their own in-house radiopharmaceutical preparation capabilities. AZEDRA is also sold in the U.S. through an AZEDRA direct sales team. RELISTOR was licensed to Bausch, and we collect quarterly royalties based on those sales.
We also maintain our own direct sales force in Canada for certain of our products. In Europe, Australia, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, we generally rely on third-party distributors to market, sell and distribute our nuclear imaging and ultrasound enhancing agent products, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country regional basis. Our headquarters are located in North Billerica, MA with offices in New York, NY; Somerset, NJ; Montreal, Canada and Lund, Sweden.
Anticipated continued growth of DEFINITY and Expansion of Our Ultrasound Microbubble Franchise 
DEFINITY is the leading ultrasound enhancing agent based on revenue and usage in the U.S., and is indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. Numerous patient conditions can decrease the quality of images of the left ventricle, the primary pumping chamber of the heart. The term DEFINITY includes its activated and non-activated forms.
DEFINITY is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid, which, upon activation in a VIALMIX apparatus, a medical device specifically designed for DEFINITY, becomes a homogenous, opaque, milky white injectable suspension of perflutren-containing lipid microspheres. After activation and intravenous injection, DEFINITY opacifies the left ventricular chamber and improves the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border, or innermost layer of tissue that lines the chamber of the left ventricle. Better visualization of the left ventricle allows clinicians to make more informed decisions about disease status.
There were approximately 31.5 million echocardiograms performed in the U.S. in 2020 according to a third party source. Assuming 20% of echocardiograms produce suboptimal images, as stated in the clinical literature, we estimate that approximately 6.3 million echocardiograms in 2020 produced suboptimal images. In 2019, a year in which the volume of echocardiograms was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 35.1 million echocardiograms performed in the U.S. according to a third party source. Assuming the same 20% of suboptimal images, we estimate that approximately 7.0 million echocardiograms in 2019 produced suboptimal images.
Since its launch in 2001, DEFINITY has been used in imaging procedures in more than 16.1 million studies throughout the world. We estimate that DEFINITY had over 80% share of the U.S. segment for ultrasound enhancing agents in echocardiography procedures as of December 2020. DEFINITY currently competes with Optison, a GE Healthcare product, Lumason, a Bracco product (known as SonoVue outside the U.S.) as well as echocardiography without ultrasound enhancing agents and non-echocardiography imaging modalities. DEFINITY, Optison and Lumason all carry an FDA-required boxed warning, which has been modified over time, to notify physicians and patients about potentially serious safety concerns or risks posed by the products. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Ultrasound enhancing agents may cause side effects which could limit our ability to sell DEFINITY.”
As we continue to pursue expanding our microbubble franchise, our activities include:
•Patents - We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. for DEFINITY we now own a total of four Orange Book-listed method of use patents, one of which expires in 2035 and three of which expire in 2037, as well as additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. In the U.S. for DEFINITY RT, we own a total of five Orange Book-listed patents, including a composition of matter patent which expires in 2035. Outside of the U.S., while our original DEFINITY patent protection and regulatory exclusivity have generally expired, we are currently prosecuting additional DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT patents to obtain similar patent protection as in the U.S. The Orange Book-listed patents include a patent on the use of VIALMIX RFID which expires in 2037; additional VIALMIX RFID patent applications have been submitted in major markets throughout the world.
•Hatch-Waxman Act - Even though our longest duration Orange Book-listed DEFINITY patent extends until March 2037, because our Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expired in June 2019, we may face generic DEFINITY challengers in the near to intermediate term. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe an Orange Book-listed patent or that an Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. With respect to any Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product, the ANDA applicant must give a notice to the innovator (a “Notice”) that the ANDA applicant certifies that its generic candidate will not infringe the innovator’s Orange Book-listed patent or that the Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. The innovator can then challenge the ANDA applicant in court within 45 days of receiving that Notice, and FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months (measured from the date on which a Notice is received) while the patent dispute between the innovator and the ANDA applicant is resolved in court. The 30 month stay could potentially expire sooner if the courts determine that no infringement had occurred or that the challenged Orange Book-listed patent is invalid or if the parties otherwise settle their dispute.
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received any Notice from an ANDA applicant. If we were to (i) receive any such Notice in the future, (ii) bring a patent infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving that Notice, and (iii) successfully obtain the full 30 month stay, then the ANDA applicant would be 
precluded from commercializing a generic version of DEFINITY prior to the expiration of that 30 month stay period and, potentially, thereafter, depending on how the patent dispute is resolved. Solely by way of example and not based on any knowledge we currently have, if we received a Notice from an ANDA applicant in March 2021 and the full 30 month stay was obtained, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercialization until at least September 2023. If we received a Notice some number of months in the future and the full 30 month stay was obtained, the commercialization date would roll forward in the future by the same calculation.
•DEFINITY RT - In November 2020, the FDA approved our sNDA for DEFINITY RT. DEFINITY RT is a modified formulation of DEFINITY that allows both storage and shipment at room temperature (DEFINITY’s previously approved formulation requires refrigerated storage). The modified formulation provides clinicians an additional choice and allows for greater utility of this formulation in broader clinical settings. We believe DEFINITY RT will become commercially available later in 2021, although that timing cannot be assured. Given its physical characteristics, we believe DEFINITY RT is also well-suited for inclusion in kits requiring microbubbles for other indications and applications (including in kits developed by third parties of the type described in the paragraph entitled New Clinical Applications below).
•VIALMIX RFID – In August 2020, we announced the FDA approved our sNDA for our next-generation activation device designed specifically for both DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT. The activation rate and time are controlled by VIALMIX RFID through the use of radio-frequency identification technology (“RFID”) to ensure reproducible activation of DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT. The RFID tag, which is affixed to the vial label, enables the DEFINITY or DEFINITY RT vial to be appropriately activated when utilized with the VIALMIX RFID activation device.
•New Clinical Applications - As we continue to look for other opportunities to expand our microbubble franchise, we are evaluating new indications and clinical applications beyond echocardiography and ultrasound enhancing agent imaging generally. 
•In April 2019, we announced a strategic development and commercial collaboration with Cerevast Medical, Inc. (“Cerevast”) in which our microbubbles will be used in connection with Cerevast’s ocular ultrasound device to improve blood flow in occluded retinal veins in the eye. Retinal vein occlusion is one of the most common causes of vision loss worldwide. 
•In December 2019, we announced a strategic commercial supply agreement with CarThera for the use of our microbubbles in combination with SonoCloud, a proprietary implantable device in development for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a lethal and devastating form of brain cancer with median survival of 15 months after diagnosis.
•In October 2020, we announced a strategic collaboration with Insightec Ltd. (“Insightec”) which will use our microbubbles in connection with Insightec’s transcranial guided focused ultrasound device for the treatment of glioblastoma as well as other neurodegenerative conditions. 
•In-House Manufacturing - We have completed construction of specialized, in-house manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility for DEFINITY and, potentially, other sterile vial products. We believe the investment in these efforts will allow us to better control DEFINITY manufacturing and inventory, reduce our costs in a potentially more price competitive environment, and provide us with supply chain redundancy. We currently expect to make use of this in-house manufacturing capability in late 2021, although that timing cannot be assured.
•DEFINITY in China - In March 2020 in connection with our Chinese development and distribution arrangement with Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Company (“Double-Crane”), we filed an Import Drug License application with the National Medical Products Administration, or the NMPA, for the use of DEFINITY for the echocardiography indication. We believe this is an important milestone in our efforts to commercialize DEFINITY in China. Double-Crane is also in the process of analyzing the clinical results relating to the liver and kidney indications and will also work with us to prepare an Import Drug License application for those indications.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with DEFINITY and see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Comparison of the Periods Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019-Revenues” for further information on total revenue contributed by DEFINITY in each of our last three fiscal years.
TechneLite
TechneLite is a self-contained system or generator of Technetium (“Tc-99m”), a radioactive isotope with a six hour half-life, used by radiopharmacies to prepare various nuclear imaging agents. Tc-99m results from the radioactive decay of Mo-99, itself a radioisotope with a 66-hour half-life produced in nuclear research reactors around the world from enriched uranium. The TechneLite generator is a little larger than a coffee can in size, and the self-contained system houses a vertical glass column at its core that contains Mo-99. During our manufacturing process, Mo-99 is added to the column within the generator where it is adsorbed onto alumina powder. The column is sterilized, enclosed in a lead shield and further sealed in a cylindrical plastic container, which is then immediately shipped to our radiopharmacy customers. Because of the short half-lives of Mo-99 and Tc-99m, radiopharmacies typically purchase TechneLite generators on a weekly basis pursuant to standing orders.
The Tc-99m produced by our TechneLite generator is the medical radioisotope that can be attached to a number of imaging agents, including our own Cardiolite products and NEUROLITE, during the radiolabeling process. To radiolabel a Tc-99m-based radiopharmaceutical, a vial of sterile saline and a vacuum vial are each affixed to the top of a TechneLite generator. The sterile saline is pulled through the generator where it attracts Tc-99m resulting from the radioactive decay of Mo-99 within the generator column. The Tc-99m-containing radioactive saline is then pulled into the vacuum vial and subsequently combined by a radiopharmacist with the applicable imaging agent, and individual patient-specific radiolabeled imaging agent doses are then prepared. When administered, the imaging agent binds to specific tissues or organs for a period of time, enabling the Tc-99m to illuminate the functional health of the imaged tissues or organs in a diagnostic image. Our ability to produce and market TechneLite is highly dependent on our supply of Mo-99. See “Raw Materials and Supply Relationships—Molybdenum-99” below.
TechneLite is currently marketed primarily in North America and Latin America, largely to radiopharmacies that prepare unit doses of radiopharmaceutical imaging agents and ship these preparations directly to hospitals for administration to patients. In the U.S., we have supply contracts with the significant radiopharmacy groups, including Cardinal, RLS, UPPI, Jubilant Radiopharma and PharmaLogic. We also supply generators on a purchase order basis to other customers. We estimate that TechneLite had approximately one third of the U.S. generator market as of December 31, 2020, competing primarily with Tc-99m-based generators produced by Curium. Outside of the U.S., we sell generators through supply agreements with radiopharmacy chains, through distributors or to separate customers.
The Mo-99 used in our TechneLite generators can be produced using targets made of either highly-enriched uranium (“HEU”) or low-enriched uranium (“LEU”). LEU consists of uranium that contains less than 20% of the uranium-235 isotope. HEU is considered weapons grade material, with 20% or more of uranium-235. The American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2012 encourages the domestic production of LEU Mo-99 and provides for the eventual prohibition of the export of HEU from the U.S. Although Medicare generally does not provide separate payment to hospitals for the use of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals administered in an outpatient setting, since 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, has provided an add-on payment of $10 under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system for every Tc-99m diagnostic dose produced from non-HEU sourced Mo-99, to cover the marginal cost for radioisotopes produced from non-HEU sources. Our LEU TechneLite generator satisfies the reimbursement requirements under the applicable CMS rules.
TechneLite has patent protection in the U.S. and various foreign countries on certain component technology currently expiring in 2029, and we are pursuing additional patent protection in the U.S. and world-wide on other component technology that, if granted, would expire in 2040. In addition, given the significant know-how and trade secrets associated with the methods of manufacturing and assembling the TechneLite generator, we believe we have a substantial amount of valuable and defensible proprietary intellectual property associated with the product. We believe that our substantial capital investments in our highly automated TechneLite production line and our extensive experience in complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for the handling of nuclear materials create significant and sustainable competitive advantages for us in generator manufacturing and distribution.
See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Comparison of the Periods Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019-Revenues” for further information on total revenue contributed by TechneLite in each of our last three fiscal years.
Our Portfolio of Clinical Development Candidates
In addition to our commercial products, we now have an extensive portfolio of product candidates in clinical development, including:
•PyL (also known as 18F-DCFPyL) is a fluorine 18-based PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent that enables visualization of primary tumors as well as bone and soft tissue metastases, with potential high clinical utility in the detection of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer. Progenics has completed a clinical development program that consisted of two pivotal clinical studies, which were designed to provide robust, prospective, well-controlled, and pathology- or composite truth standard-verified data to establish the safety and diagnostic performance of PyL across the disease continuum of prostate cancer. The 
results from these studies provide data in support of the potential of PyL to reliably detect and localize disease, including in patients with low PSA values, and may help enable appropriate disease management, thus supporting the potential use for detection of recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer. We filed the PyL NDA with the FDA in September 2020 and received notice of priority review in December 2020 with a PDUFA date of May 28, 2021.
•flurpiridaz F 18 is a fluorine 18-based PET MPI agent designed to assess blood flow to the heart in patients suspected of coronary artery disease (CAD). In April 2017, we announced entering into a definitive, exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement with GE Healthcare for the agent’s continued Phase 3 development and worldwide commercialization. The second Phase 3 trial is now underway; however, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment in the global clinical development program had been delayed and has now resumed at a slower recruiting pace. GE Healthcare now expects to complete enrollment in the second half of 2021 and, assuming regulatory approval, begin commercialization in early 2023. 
•1095 (also known as I-131-1095) is a PSMA-targeted iodine-131 labeled small molecule that is designed to deliver a dose of beta radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. Progenics initiated eleven clinical sites in the U.S. along with the six active sites in Canada to support enrollment in the Company’s multicenter, randomized, controlled, ARROW Phase 2 study in mCRPC. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Progenics new enrollment in the Phase 2 trial was paused to minimize the risk to subjects and healthcare providers during the pandemic. Subjects who were active and had been randomized for the study continued to receive treatment doses and were monitored for safety and efficacy in a manner that is permissible by each clinical site. New enrollment in the ARROW Phase 2 study restarted in October 2020.
•LMI 1195 is a fluorine 18-based PET imaging agent for the norepinephrine pathway. We have designed but not yet commenced two Phase 3 clinical trials for the use of LMI 1195 for the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors in pediatric and adult populations, respectively. The FDA has granted an Orphan Drug designation for the use of LMI 1195 in the management indication. We have also received notice of eligibility for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher for a subsequent human drug application so long as LMI 1195 is approved by the FDA for its rare pediatric disease indication. Pursuant to federal legislation passed and signed into law in late 2020, the expiration date of the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program was extended from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2026.
•PSMA TTC is a thorium-227 labeled PSMA-targeted antibody therapeutic. PSMA TTC is designed to deliver a dose of alpha radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. Bayer AG (“Bayer”) has exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products using our PSMA antibody platform in combination with Bayer’s alpha-emitting radionuclides. Bayer is conducting a Phase 1 trial of PSMA TTC in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”).
•1404 is a Tc-99m labeled small molecule which binds to PSMA and is used as a SPECT/CT imaging agent to diagnose and detect localized prostate cancer as well as soft tissue and bone metastases. ROTOP has exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize 1404 in Europe.
•PSMA-AI is an AI-based imaging analysis technology that assists readers in quantification and standardized reporting of PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging, providing an objective understanding of disease status. The technology automatically analyzes the CT image to segment anatomical regions – 51 bones and 12 soft tissue organs. This CT segmentation enables automated localization, detection and quantification of potential PSMA-avid lesions in the PET image, which is incorporated into a standardized report for physicians. In a recent study, the technology demonstrated better consistency in quantitative assessment across multiple readers and high sensitivity (>90%) in detecting potential lesions in PSMA PET/CT. The clinical utility of the device is being investigated in multiple outcome-based studies.
•leronlimab (PRO 140) is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 appears to act as an HIV entry inhibitor and may play a broader role in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses. It is owned by CytoDyn Inc. (“CytoDyn”) pursuant to our agreement with CytoDyn, as described below. In May 2020, CytoDyn announced it submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA for approval of leronlimab in combination therapy for HIV infection. On July 13, 2020, CytoDyn announced that it had received a refusal to file letter from the FDA for the BLA. In August and September 2020, the FDA provided written responses to CytoDyn’s questions and met telephonically with CytoDyn key personnel and its clinical research organization concerning its recent BLA for this HIV combination therapy to expedite the resubmission of its BLA filing for this indication. CytoDyn is working diligently to resubmit the BLA, which it expects to file in the first half of calendar year 2021. Leronlimab is also being evaluated by CytoDyn for patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 indications in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial that was recently completed. Also, CytoDyn has started recruiting for a Phase 2b/3 trial for 390 severe or critical COVID-19 patients.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we invested $32.8 million, $20.0 million and $17.1 million in research and development (“R&D”), respectively. Our R&D team includes our Medical Affairs and Medical Information functions, which educate physicians on the scientific aspects of our commercial products and the approved indications.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with our clinical development programs.

In the U.S. and Canada, our sales team of approximately 80 employees is split into separate sales teams for each of DEFINITY, AZEDRA and our radiopharmaceutical products. We are also beginning to assemble a sales and commercial team for PyL in anticipation of potential FDA approval and a commercial launch later in 2021. 
We sell a majority of our radiopharmaceutical products in the U.S. to five radiopharmacy groups—namely Cardinal, RLS, UPPI, Jubilant Radiopharma and PharmaLogic. Our contractual distribution and other arrangements with these radiopharmacy groups are as follows:
•Cardinal maintains approximately 131 radiopharmacies that are typically located in large, densely populated urban areas in the U.S. We estimate that Cardinal’s radiopharmacies distributed approximately 44% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2020. Our supply agreement with Cardinal relating to TechneLite, Xenon, NEUROLITE and other products has been extended until December 31, 2022. The agreement specifies pricing levels and requirements to purchase minimum percentages of certain products during certain periods. The agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party and certain force majeure events.
•RLS maintains approximately 31 radiopharmacies in the U.S. that purchase our TechneLite generators. RLS purchased these radiopharmacies from GE Healthcare in the third quarter of 2020. We estimate that RLS distributed approximately 8% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2020. We currently have an agreement with RLS for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon and Gallium. The agreement provides that RLS will purchase a minimum percentage of TechneLite generators as well as certain other products from us. Our agreement, which has been extended until December 31, 2021, may be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of specified events including a material breach by either party, bankruptcy by either party, certain irresolvable regulatory changes or economic circumstances, or force majeure events.
•UPPI is a cooperative purchasing group (roughly analogous to a group purchasing organization) of approximately 52 independently owned or smaller chain radiopharmacies located in the U.S. UPPI’s radiopharmacies are typically broadly dispersed geographically, with some urban presence and a substantial number of radiopharmacies located in suburban and rural areas of the country. We estimate that these independent radiopharmacies, together with approximately 13 unaffiliated, independent radiopharmacies, distributed approximately 19% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2020. We currently have an agreement with UPPI for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon and certain other products to radiopharmacies or families of radiopharmacies within the UPPI cooperative purchasing group. The agreement contains specified pricing levels based upon specified purchase amounts for UPPI. We are entitled to terminate the UPPI agreement upon 60 days written notice. The UPPI agreement has been extended until December 31, 2023.
•Jubilant Radiopharma maintains approximately 48 radiopharmacies in the U.S. that purchase a range of our products. We estimate that Jubilant Radiopharma distributed approximately 13% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2020. We currently have an agreement with Jubilant Radiopharma for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon, NEUROLITE and other products. The agreement specifies pricing levels and volume and percentage purchase requirements. The agreement has been extended until June 30, 2021 and may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party.
•PharmaLogic maintains approximately 27 radiopharmacies in the U.S. that purchase a range of our products. We estimate that PharmaLogic distributed approximately 4% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2020. Our written supply agreement with PharmaLogic relating to TechneLite, Xenon, Cardiolite and other products has been extended until December 31, 2021. The agreement specifies pricing levels and requirements to purchase minimum percentages of certain products during certain periods. The agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party and certain force majeure events.
In addition to the distribution arrangements for our radiopharmaceutical products described above, we also sell certain of our radiopharmaceutical products to independent radiopharmacies and directly to hospitals and clinics that maintain in-house radiopharmaceutical capabilities and operations. In the latter case, this represents a small percentage of overall sales because the majority of hospitals and clinics do not maintain these in-house capabilities.
In Canada, we operate some direct distribution activities and also rely on third party distributors. In Europe, Australia, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, we utilize third party distributor relationships to market, sell and distribute our products, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country regional basis.
In March 2012, we entered into a development and distribution arrangement with Double-Crane for DEFINITY in China, Hong Kong and Macau. With Double-Crane’s support, we are currently pursuing Chinese regulatory approval required to commercialize DEFINITY. In July 2013, we submitted a clinical trial application to the NMPA seeking an Import Drug License. After a very extensive waiting period caused by a large number of drugs seeking NMPA regulatory approval, in February 2016, the NMPA approved our clinical trial application. Double-Crane has conducted on our behalf three confirmatory clinical trials in pursuit of cardiac, liver and kidney imaging indications, as well as one small pharmacokinetic study. In March 2020, we filed an Import Drug License application with the NMPA for the use of DEFINITY for the echocardiography indication. We believe this is an important milestone in our efforts to commercialize DEFINITY in China. Double-Crane is also in the process of analyzing the clinical results relating to the liver and kidney indications and will also work with us to prepare an Import Drug License application for those indications.
Seasonality
For the diagnostic portion of our business, we have some modest seasonality as patients may seek to schedule diagnostic imaging procedures less frequently during the summer vacation months and over the year-end holidays.
Customers
No customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of orders for which a delivery schedule within the next twelve months has been specified. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers at any time with the exception of TechneLite orders. For TechneLite, customers must provide us with four weeks advanced notice to cancel an order. We do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it has historically been immaterial relative to our consolidated revenues and is not necessarily indicative of future revenues for any given period.
Competition
We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies, such as our efficient manufacturing processes, our established distribution network, our experienced field sales organization and our customer service focus, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors.
The markets for our products are highly competitive and continually evolving. Our principal competitors for our current commercial products and leading clinical development candidates include large, global companies that are more diversified than we are and that have substantial financial, manufacturing, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources:
•For DEFINITY, our competitors currently include GE Healthcare and Bracco.
•For a number of our radiopharmaceutical commercial products, our competitors currently include Curium, GE Healthcare, Bracco and Jubilant Life Sciences, an affiliate of JHS and Jubilant Radiopharma, as well as other competitors, including NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes. 
•For PyL, if and when it is approved by the FDA, it will compete with Bracco’s Axumin (fluciclovine F 18). We also may face competition from Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, which also has a PSMA-targeted prostate cancer PET diagnostic imaging agent currently under review with the FDA.
•For RELISTOR, our principal competitors include Nektar Therapeutics, in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC; Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.; Mallinckrodt plc, in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; and BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.; together with other prescription, as well as over-the-counter, laxatives used as first line therapy for OIC.
•For AZEDRA, there are currently no other FDA approved anticancer treatments in the U.S. for malignant, recurrent, and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.
•For 1095, our principal competitors in the field of mCRPC for radiopharmaceutical therapeutics may include Novartis AG; Point Biopharma; Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited; and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., each of which have product candidates in development.
We cannot anticipate the actions of our current or future competitors in the same or competing diagnostic modalities, such as significant price reductions on products that are comparable to our own, development of new products that are more cost-effective or have superior performance than our current products or the introduction of generic versions after our proprietary products lose their patent protection. In addition, distributors of our products could attempt to shift end-users to competing diagnostic modalities and 
products, or bundle the sale of a portfolio of products, to the detriment of our specific products. Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of these activities.
Further, the radiopharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry continues to evolve strategically, with several market participants either recently sold or for sale. In addition, the supply-demand dynamics of the industry are complex because of large market positions of some participants, legacy businesses, government subsidies (in particular, relating to the manufacture of radioisotopes), and group purchasing arrangements. We cannot predict what impact new owners and new operators may have on the strategic decision-making of our competitors, customers and suppliers.
Raw Materials and Supply Relationships
We rely on certain raw materials and supplies to produce our products. Due to the specialized nature of our products and the limited, and sometimes intermittent, supply of raw materials available in the market, we have established relationships with several key suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest suppliers of raw materials and supplies were Institute for Radioelements (“IRE”), ANSTO and NTP, which, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 23% of our total purchases.
Molybdenum-99
Our TechneLite, Cardiolite and NEUROLITE products all rely on Mo-99, the radioisotope which is produced by bombarding uranium with neutrons in research reactors. With a 66-hour half-life, Mo-99 decays into, among other things, Tc-99m, another radioisotope with a half-life of six hours. Tc-99m is the isotope that is attached to radiopharmaceuticals, including our own Cardiolite and NEUROLITE, during the labeling process and is the most common radioisotope used for medical diagnostic imaging purposes.
We currently purchase finished Mo-99 from three of the four main processing sites in the world, namely IRE in Belgium, NTP in South Africa and ANSTO in Australia. These processing sites provide us Mo-99 from five of the six main Mo-99-producing reactors in the world, namely BR2 in Belgium, LVR-15 in the Czech Republic, HFR in The Netherlands, SAFARI in South Africa and OPAL in Australia.
Our agreement with IRE (the “IRE Agreement”) contains minimum percentage volume requirements and unit pricing. The IRE Agreement also requires IRE to provide certain favorable allocations of Mo-99 during periods of supply shortage or failure. The IRE Agreement also provides for an increased supply of Mo-99 derived from LEU targets upon IRE’s completion of its ongoing conversion program to modify its facilities and processes in accordance with Belgian nuclear security commitments. The IRE Agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure by IRE to provide our required amount of Mo-99, material breach of any provision by either party, bankruptcy by either party or force majeure events. The IRE Agreement expires on December 31, 2022, and is renewable by LMI on a year-to-year basis thereafter.
Our agreement with NTP (the “NTP Agreement”), with NTP acting for itself and on behalf of its subcontractor ANSTO, specifies LMI’s percentage purchase requirements and unit pricing, and provides for the supply of Mo-99 derived from LEU targets from NTP and ANSTO. The NTP Agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure by NTP to provide our required amount of Mo-99, material breach of any provision by either party, bankruptcy by either party or force majeure events. The NTP Agreement expires on December 31, 2021.
Despite our globally diverse Mo-99 suppliers, we still face challenges in our Mo-99 supply chain. The NTP processing facility had periodic outages in 2017, 2018 and 2019. When NTP was not producing, we relied on Mo-99 supply from both IRE and ANSTO to limit the impact of the NTP outages. In 2019 and 2020, ANSTO experienced multiple facility issues that resulted in ANSTO outages and volume limitations, during which time we relied on IRE and NTP to limit the impact of those outages and limitations. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced challenges receiving regularly scheduled orders of Mo-99 from our global suppliers, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. We continue to manage these various supply chain challenges, but depending on reactor and processor schedules and operations, at times we have not been able to fill some or all of the demand for our TechneLite generators on certain manufacturing days. A prolonged disruption of service from one of our three Mo-99 processing sites or one of their main Mo-99-producing reactors could have a substantial negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We are also pursuing additional sources of Mo-99 from potential new producers to further augment our current supply. In November 2014, we entered into a strategic arrangement with SHINE for the future supply of Mo-99. Under the terms of the supply agreement, SHINE will provide Mo-99 produced using its proprietary LEU-solution technology for use in our TechneLite generators once SHINE’s facility becomes operational and receives all necessary regulatory approvals, which SHINE now estimates will occur in 2022. However, we cannot assure you that SHINE or any other possible additional sources of Mo-99 will result in commercial quantities of Mo-99 for our business, or that these new suppliers together with our current suppliers will be able to deliver a sufficient quantity of Mo-99 to meet our needs.
Xenon
Xenon is a by-product of the Mo-99 production process. Under a strategic agreement we entered into in 2015, we receive from IRE bulk unprocessed Xenon, which we process and finish for our customers at our North Billerica, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. That contract runs through June 30, 2022, and is subject to further extension. Until we can qualify an additional source of bulk unprocessed Xenon, we will rely on IRE as a sole source provider.
Iodine 131
Iodine 131 is also a by-product of the Mo-99 production process, and it is the active radioisotope ingredient in both AZEDRA and 1095. We receive Iodine 131 from IsoSolutions Marketing & Management Inc., which sources the isotope from IRE in Belgium. We use Iodine 131 at our Somerset facility to manufacture and produce AZEDRA. We also rely on Center for Probe Development and Commercialization (CPDC) for our clinical supply requirements for 1095. CPDC sources Iodine 131 from IRE in Belgium and NTP in South Africa.
Other Materials
We have additional supply arrangements for active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, packaging materials and other materials and components, none of which are exclusive, but a number of which are sole source, and all of which we currently believe are either in good standing or replaceable without any material disruption to our business.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with our raw materials and supply arrangements.
Manufacturing
We maintain manufacturing operations at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. We manufacture TechneLite on a highly automated production line, Thallium and Gallium and certain radiochemicals using our cyclotron technology, and we process and finish Xenon and QUADRAMET using our hot cell infrastructure. We also operate a manufacturing facility at Somerset, NJ for AZEDRA that may also provide manufacturing support for 1095 in the future. We manufacture, finish and distribute our radiopharmaceutical products on a just-in-time basis, and supply our customers with these products either by next day delivery services or by either ground or air custom logistics. We believe that our substantial capital investments in our highly automated generator production line, our cyclotrons and our other manufacturing assets, and our extensive experience in complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for the handling of nuclear materials and operations in a highly regulated environment, create significant and sustainable competitive advantages for us.
In addition to our in-house manufacturing capabilities, a substantial portion of our products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturing organizations, and in certain instances, we rely on them for sole source manufacturing. To ensure the quality of the products that are manufactured by third parties, the key raw materials used in those products are first sent to our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, where we test them prior to the third party manufacturing of the final product. After the final products are manufactured, they are sent back to us for final quality control testing, and then we ship them to our customers. We have expertise in the design, development and validation of complex manufacturing systems and processes, and our strong execution and quality control culture supports the just-in-time manufacturing model at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. 
PyL and flurpiridaz F 18 will require the creation of a field-based network of specialized PMFs with radioisotope-producing cyclotrons. The radioisotope used in both PyL and flurpiridaz F 18 is fluorine-18, or F 18, which has a 110 minute half-life, requiring that these products be manufactured and distributed rapidly to end-users. After being made on a cyclotron at a PMF, the F 18 is then combined with certain chemical ingredients in specially designed chemistry synthesis boxes to manufacture either PyL or flurpiridaz F 18. PyL or flurpiridaz F 18 is next transferred to a radiopharmacist who prepares and dispenses patient-specific doses from the final product. Because each of the PMFs manufacturing these products will be deemed by the FDA to be a separate manufacturing site, each will have to be approved by the FDA, and we can give no assurance that the FDA will do this in accordance with the planned roll-out schedule for the products. In our PyL NDA, we included a limited number of PMFs for approval, and we intend to add in a sequenced manner, using FDA site approval processes, additional PMFs to our manufacturing network in the months following FDA product approval with the goal of having broad availability for the U.S. population within six months of product approval.
We are also in the final stages of an extensive, multi-year effort to add specialized manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. This project should not only deliver efficiencies and supply chain redundancy for our current portfolio but should also afford us increased flexibility as we consider additional external opportunities. We currently expect to make use of this in-house manufacturing capability in late 2021. However, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that we will be able to successfully manufacture any additional commercial products at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility.
Manufacturing and Supply Arrangements
We currently have the following technology transfer and manufacturing and supply agreements in place for some of our major products:
•DEFINITY—In February 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS, for the manufacture of DEFINITY. Under the agreement, JHS manufactured DEFINITY for us for an initial term of five years. In September 2016, we extended the agreement through January 2022. The agreement contains automatic renewals for additional one-year periods thereafter. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events such as a material breach or default by either party, or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement also requires us to place orders for a minimum percentage of our requirements for DEFINITY with JHS. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of DEFINITY from JHS to meet expected demand.
On May 3, 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with SBL to perform technology transfer and process development services to manufacture and supply DEFINITY RT. There are no minimum purchase requirements under this agreement, which has an initial term of five years from the date of first commercial sale and is renewable at our option for an additional five years. This agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including material breach or bankruptcy of either party. We believe DEFINITY RT will become commercially available later in 2021, although that timing cannot be assured.
•Cardiolite—In May 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS for the manufacture of Cardiolite products. In the third quarter of 2016, we completed the technology transfer process and received FDA approval to manufacture Cardiolite at JHS. Under the agreement, JHS has agreed to manufacture products for an initial term of five years from the effective date. That agreement has now been extended until December 31, 2021, and can be further extended for two additional one-year periods thereafter so long as the parties, using good faith, reasonable efforts, agree to new pricing for the upcoming additional term. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including material breach or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement requires us to place orders for 100% of our requirements for Cardiolite products with JHS during such term. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of Cardiolite products from JHS to meet expected demand.
•NEUROLITE—In May 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS for the manufacture of NEUROLITE, and in January 2015, the FDA granted approval to manufacture NEUROLITE at JHS. Under the agreement, JHS agreed to manufacture NEUROLITE for an initial term of five years from the effective date. That agreement has now been extended until December 31, 2021, and can be further extended for two additional one-year periods thereafter so long as the parties, using good faith, reasonable efforts, agree to new pricing for the upcoming additional term. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including material breach or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement also requires us to place orders for 100% of our requirements for NEUROLITE during such term. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of NEUROLITE from JHS to meet expected demand.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with our manufacturing relationships.
Strategic Activities
In addition to integrating the new assets and programs resulting from the Progenics Acquisition, we continue to seek ways to further expand our portfolio of products and product candidates and how best to optimize the value of our current assets, evaluating a number of different opportunities to collaborate with others or to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates, businesses and technologies to drive our future growth. As the Progenics Acquisition indicates, we are particularly interested in expanding our presence in oncology, in both radiotherapeutics and diagnostics. In May 2019, we commenced an initiative to build out our Pharma Services capabilities by entering into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with NanoMab Technology Limited (“NanoMab”), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of next generation radiopharmaceuticals for cancer precision medicine. We believe this collaboration will provide the first broadly-available PD-L1 imaging biomarker research tool to pharmaceutical companies and academic centers conducting clinical trials on immuno-oncology treatments, including combination therapies. We have also expanded our Pharma Services offering to include PyL for pharmaceutical companies developing PSMA-targeted therapies and have entered into PyL clinical supply agreements with each of Regeneron, Bayer and POINT BioPharma for use of PyL in drug development programs. We can give no assurance as to when or if any of these Pharma Services collaborations will be successful or accretive to earnings.
In addition, as described above, we continue to expand our microbubble franchise. In October 2020, we announced a strategic collaboration with Insightec which will use our microbubbles in connection with Insightec’s transcranial guided focused ultrasound device for the treatment of glioblastoma as well as other neurodegenerative conditions. Glioblastoma is a lethal and devastating form of brain cancer with median survival of 15 months after diagnosis. Previously, we announced a strategic commercial supply agreement with CarThera for the use of our microbubbles in combination with SonoCloud, a proprietary implantable device in development for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. We also previously announced a strategic development and commercial collaboration with Cerevast in which our microbubbles will be used in connection with Cerevast’s ocular ultrasound device to improve blood flow in occluded retinal veins in the eye. Retinal vein occlusion is one of the most common causes of vision loss worldwide. 
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with our strategic activities.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and foreign countries, are very important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, technological innovations, licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. Our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.
Trademarks, Service Marks and Trade Names
We own various trademarks, service marks and trade names, including, among others, DEFINITY, DEFINITY RT, TechneLite, Cardiolite, NEUROLITE, VIALMIX, VIALMIX RFID, QUADRAMET, Luminity, PyL, AZEDRA, AZEDRA Service Connection, RELISTOR, Lantheus, Lantheus Medical Imaging, Progenics, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Molecular Insight, EXINI, PyL Research Access Program and Find, Fight and Follow. We have registered these trademarks, as well as others, in the U.S. and/or numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Patents
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and formulations, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as new intellectual property is developed. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we file patent applications in numerous foreign countries in order to further protect the inventions that we consider important to the development of our international business. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio included a total of 107 issued U.S. patents, 804 issued foreign patents, 49 pending U.S. patent applications and 239 pending foreign applications, owned or exclusively licensed.
We have patent protection on certain of our commercial products and on all of our clinical development candidates. We typically seek patent protection in major markets around the world, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America. All patent terms described below are presented without giving effect to any applicable patent term adjustments or regulatory extensions. 
DEFINITY - We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. for DEFINITY we own a total of four Orange Book-listed method of use patents, one of which expires in 2035 and three of which expire in 2037, as well as additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. In the U.S. for DEFINITY RT, we own a total of five Orange Book-listed patents, including a composition of matter patent which expires in 2035. Outside of the U.S., while our original DEFINITY patent protection and regulatory exclusivity have generally expired, we are currently prosecuting additional DEFINITY and DEFINITY RT patents to obtain similar patent protection as in the U.S. The Orange Book-listed patents include a patent on the use of VIALMIX RFID which expires in 2037; additional VIALMIX RFID patent applications have been submitted in major markets throughout the world.
Even though our longest duration Orange Book-listed DEFINITY patent extends until March 2037, because our Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expired in June 2019, we may face generic DEFINITY challengers in the near to intermediate term. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe an Orange Book-listed patent or that an Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. With respect to any Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product, the ANDA applicant must give a notice to the innovator (a “Notice”) that the ANDA applicant certifies that its generic candidate will not infringe the innovator’s Orange Book-listed patent or that the Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. The innovator can then challenge the ANDA applicant in court within 45 days of receiving that Notice, and FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months (measured from the date on which a Notice is received) while the patent dispute between the innovator and the ANDA applicant is resolved in court. The 30 month stay could potentially expire sooner if the courts determine that no infringement had occurred or that the challenged Orange Book-listed patent is invalid or if the parties otherwise settle their dispute.
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received any Notice from an ANDA applicant. If we were to (i) receive any such Notice in the future, (ii) bring a patent infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving that Notice, and (iii) successfully obtain the full 30 month stay, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercializing a generic version of DEFINITY prior to the expiration of that 30 month stay period and, potentially, thereafter, depending on how the patent dispute is resolved. Solely by way of example and not based on any knowledge we currently have, if we received a Notice from an ANDA applicant in March 2021 and the full 30 month stay was obtained, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercialization until at least September 2023. If we received a Notice some number of months in the future and the full 30 month stay was obtained, the commercialization date would roll forward in the future by the same calculation.
TechneLite - We currently own patents in the U.S. and various foreign countries on certain component technology expiring in 2029, and we are pursuing additional patent protection in the U.S. and world-wide on other component technology that, if granted, would expire in 2040. In addition, given the significant know-how and trade secrets associated with the methods of manufacturing and assembling the TechneLite generator, we believe we have a substantial amount of valuable and defensible proprietary intellectual property associated with the product. 
Other Nuclear Products - Neither Cardiolite nor NEUROLITE is covered any longer by patent protection in either the U.S. or the rest of the world. Xenon, Thallium and Gallium have no patent protection; however, we have patent protection in the U.S. that expires in October 2035 for an improved container for Xenon, and are pursuing similar patent protection outside the U.S.
RELISTOR – Although the composition of matter patent for the active ingredient, methylnaltrexone, has expired, there are additional patents and pending patent applications covering various inventions relating to the product. There are eight Orange Book listed patents that cover the subcutaneous RELISTOR product, which have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2030, and there are nine Orange Book listed patents that cover the RELISTOR tablet product, which have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2031. 
Progenics has entered into three separate settlement agreements that have granted non-exclusive limited licenses with respect to certain RELISTOR subcutaneous injection applications. The non-exclusive limited licenses with two parties are currently effective on January 1, 2028 and the third non-exclusive limited license is currently effective on July 1, 2028, in each case, subject to potential acceleration clauses in those agreements. Four Canadian patents (two expiring in 2024, one in 2027 and one in 2029) have been listed with Health Canada relating to subcutaneous RELISTOR.
AZEDRA - The AZEDRA technology patent family was licensed from the University of Western Ontario (“UWO”). While certain of those patents, and associated license, have already expired, a patent relating to alternative approaches for preparing AZEDRA (not currently implemented) expires worldwide in 2022 and 2024. In addition, we own pending applications worldwide for manufacturing improvements, and the resulting compositions which, if issued, would expire in 2035.
PyL - The PyL patent family was licensed from the Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”). Patent protection for composition of matter patents, radiolabeled forms of the compound, and methods of use in the U.S. expire in 2029 and 2030. Corresponding patents issued or pending worldwide, all expire in 2029. Process improvement patent applications are pending worldwide and, if issued, would expire in 2037.
flurpiridaz F 18 - We own patents and patent applications in numerous jurisdictions covering composition, use, formulation and manufacturing, including in the U.S. a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, a formulation patent expiring in 2032, a method of use patent expiring in 2028, and manufacturing-related patents expiring in 2031 and 2033, and various patent applications, some of which, if granted, will expire in 2033. 
1095 – We own patents relating to 1095 that expire from 2027 to 2031, with the composition of matter as well as radiolabeled forms in the U.S. and Europe expiring in 2027. Additional U.S. patents for stable compositions and radiolabeling processes expire, respectively, in 2030 and 2031.
LMI 1195 - We own patents and patent applications in numerous jurisdictions covering composition, use, and manufacturing, including in the U.S. a composition of matter patent expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2027, and manufacturing-related patents expiring in 2031 and 2032, and patent applications which, if granted, will expire in 2027 and in 2031. 
1404 - We own patents relating to composition of matter, as well as technetium-99 labeled forms of 1404 expiring in the U.S. from 2029 to 2030, and expiring worldwide in 2029. In-licensed patents relating to reagents for radiolabeling expire in the U.S. in 2022.
aBSI - We own patents relating to automated detection of bone cancer metastases. The patents on this technology expire in the U.S. in 2032 and outside of the U.S. in 2028. Patent applications are pending in the U.S. and worldwide relating to aBSI improvements which, if issued will expire in 2040.
PSMA-AI – U.S. Patents and pending patent applications worldwide relating to automated medical image analysis, have expiration ranges from 2037 to 2040.
PSMA Antibody TTC – We own and in-license composition of matter patents on PSMA antibodies expiring in the U.S. in 2022 and 2023 and outside of the U.S. in 2022. 
In addition to patents, we rely, where necessary, upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how, proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These confidentiality agreements may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, and we cannot provide assurances that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, other technical know-how or proprietary information. We may not have adequate monitoring abilities to discover, or adequate remedies for, any unauthorized disclosure. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
In addition, we license third party technologies and other intellectual property rights that are incorporated into some elements of our drug discovery and development efforts. Some of these licenses are material to our business – for example, the licenses of the patent rights on RELISTOR from Wyeth LLC and on the PyL patent family from JHU.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with our intellectual property.
Regulatory Matters 
Food and Drug Laws
The development, manufacture and commercialization of our agents and products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. A number of factors substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. These factors include governmental regulation, such as detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, import and export, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, together with various post-marketing requirements. Governmental regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale as well as other civil or criminal sanctions.
Our activities related to the development, manufacture, packaging or repackaging of our pharmaceutical and medical device products subject us to a wide variety of laws and regulations. We are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, seek approvals from and comply with operating and security standards of, the FDA, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the NMPA and various state and provincial boards of pharmacy, state and provincial controlled substance agencies, state and provincial health departments and/or comparable state and provincial agencies, as well as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
The FDA and various state regulatory authorities regulate the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket approval, marketing, advertising and promotion, import and export, and sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product, we must first receive FDA approval. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Currently, the process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin, including review and approval by any institutional review board (“IRB”), serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical studies;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to current Good Clinical Practices and other requirements, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use;
•Submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) for a new drug;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) regulations; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our agents in development will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Once a pharmaceutical agent is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. This testing culminates in the submission of the IND to the FDA.
Once the IND becomes effective, including review and approval by any IRB, serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial, the clinical trial program may begin. Each new clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA before the study may begin. Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The agent is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the agent may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with those diseases.
•Phase 2. Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the agent for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to collect sufficient safety and efficacy data to support the NDA for FDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Submissions must also be made to inform the FDA of certain changes to the clinical trial protocol. Federal law also requires the sponsor to register the trials on public databases when they are initiated, and to disclose the results of the trials on public databases upon completion. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, any IRB serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at a relevant institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the agent has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Failure to register a clinical trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the agent and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the agent does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling, and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the agent. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee. A waiver of that fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The FDA may on occasion require the sponsor of an NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. The FDA also may impose one or more Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. A REMS could add training requirements for healthcare professionals, safety communications efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. Whether a REMS would be imposed on any of our products and any resulting financial impact is uncertain at this time.
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. AZEDRA currently has the Orphan Drug designation in the United States.
In the United States, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on drug products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label and promotional claims must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain other agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In addition, manufacturers of commercial PET products, including radiopharmacies, hospitals and academic medical centers, are required to submit either an NDA or ANDA in order to produce PET drugs for clinical use, or produce the drugs under an IND.
The FDA also regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export and advertising and promotion of any medical devices that we distribute pursuant to the FDCA and FDA’s implementing regulations. The Federal Trade Commission shares jurisdiction with the FDA over the promotion and advertising of certain medical devices. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of medical devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing. Currently, medical devices comprise only a small portion of our revenues.
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorization for a pharmaceutical or medical device product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously-unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, civil monetary penalties, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of pharmaceuticals or medical device products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
Because our operations include the manufacture and distribution of medical radioisotopes and other medical products, we are subject to regulation by the NRC and the departments of health of each state in which we operate and the applicable state boards of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA is also involved in the regulation of cyclotron facilities where PET products are produced in compliance with cGMP requirements and U.S. Pharmacopeia requirements for PET drug compounding.
Drug laws also are in effect in many of the non-U.S. markets in which we conduct business. These laws range from comprehensive drug approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications. In addition, inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems. Most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amount of testing and documentation required for approval or clearance of new drugs and devices, all of which add to the expense of product introduction. Similar trends also are evident in major non-U.S. markets, including Canada, the European Union, Australia and Japan.
To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable FDA, NRC and other state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements, we regularly review our quality systems to assess their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. As part of our quality review, we perform assessments of our suppliers of the raw materials that are incorporated into products and conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of our products. From time to time, we may determine that products we manufactured or marketed do not meet our specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the International Standards Organization, or regulatory requirements. When a quality or regulatory issue is identified, we investigate the issue and take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling and other actions.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Hatch-Waxman Act added two pathways for FDA drug approval. First, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits the FDA to approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator product and provides relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data. See “Item 1. Business - Patents.” Second, the Hatch-Waxman Act created what is known as a Section 505(b) (2) NDA, which requires the same information as a full NDA (known as a Section 505(b) (1) NDA), including full reports of clinical and preclinical studies but allows some of the information from the reports required for marketing approval to come from studies which the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference. A Section 505(b) (2) NDA permits a manufacturer to obtain marketing approval for a drug without needing to conduct or obtain a right of reference for all of the required studies. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for: (1) restoration of a portion of a product’s patent term that was lost during clinical development and application review by the FDA; and (2) statutory protection, known as exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent term extension can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Patent term extensions, however, are subject to a maximum extension of five years, and the patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the FDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a period of statutory protection for new drugs that receive NDA approval from the FDA. If the FDA approves a Section 505(b) (1) NDA for a new drug that is a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, then the Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the submission or approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b) (2) NDA for a period of five years from the date of approval of the NDA, except that the FDA may accept an application for review after four years under certain circumstances, specifically a patent challenge for one or more patents listed by the NDA holder in FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”), submitted in a “Paragraph IV” Certification. The Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of a full NDA, as opposed to an ANDA or Section 505(b) (2) NDA, for any drug, but the competitor would be required to conduct its own clinical trials, and any use of the drug for which marketing approval is sought could not violate another NDA holder’s patent claims. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a three-year period of exclusivity for an NDA for a new drug containing an active moiety that was previously approved by the FDA, but also includes new clinical data (other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) to support an innovation over the previously-approved drug and those studies were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period does not prohibit the FDA from accepting an application from a third party for a drug with that same innovation, but it does prohibit the FDA from approving that application for the three-year period. The three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA, with limited exceptions, from approving generic drugs containing the same active ingredient but without the new innovation.
Healthcare Reform and Other Laws Affecting Payment
We operate in a highly-regulated industry. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation that may affect the availability and cost of healthcare. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changes the way in which healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that affect coverage, reimbursement and/or delivery of drug products and the medical imaging procedures in which our drug products are used. Key provisions that currently affect our business include the following:
•increasing the presumed utilization rate for imaging equipment costing $1.0 million or more in the physician office and free-standing imaging facility setting which reduces the Medicare per procedure medical imaging reimbursement; which rate was further increased by subsequent legislation effective January 1, 2014;
•increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care organizations; and
•imposing a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell brand name prescription drugs to specified federal government programs.
The Healthcare Reform Act also amended the federal self-referral laws, requiring referring physicians to inform patients under certain circumstances that the patients may obtain services, including MRI, computed tomography (“CT”), PET and certain other diagnostic imaging services, from a provider other than that physician, another physician in his or her group practice, or another individual under direct supervision of the physician or another physician in the group practice. The referring physician must provide each patient with a written list of other suppliers who furnish those services in the area in which the patient resides. These requirements could have the effect of shifting where certain diagnostic medical imaging procedures are performed.
The Healthcare Reform Act has been subject to political and judicial challenges. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that effectively eliminated the “individual mandate” to maintain health insurance coverage by eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. In December 2019, a federal appeals court agreed that the individual mandate provision was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to assess more carefully whether any provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act were severable and could survive. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard an appeal of the federal appeals court decision, but has not opined on the constitutionality of the individual mandate or the severability of the remaining aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act. Pending resolution of this case, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. For example, in May 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As an example, legislation passed in 2019 revised how certain prices reported by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, a revision that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will save the federal government approximately $3.0 billion in the next ten years. As another example, in November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule that announced a new “most favored nation” payment model for certain Medicare Part B drugs, which would reduce the Medicare payment amount for such drugs to the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other similar countries. (Multiple federal courts have issued temporary injunctions blocking implementation of this final rule). Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could limit our flexibility in establishing prices for our products or otherwise adversely affect our business if implemented. Changes could occur at the federal level or state level and may be adopted by statute, rule, or sub-regulatory policies. Recent state legislative efforts seek to address drug costs and generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Some of those efforts have been subject to legal challenge.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products or services provided with our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect through fiscal year 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act suspended the 2% payment adjustment for dates of service from May 1 through December 31, 2020, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 subsequently extended this suspension until March 31, 2021. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The Healthcare Reform Act clarifies the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $104,330 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act revised the FCA to provide that a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is, therefore, a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws.
Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). As discussed, a claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the U.S. federal government and various states, as well as by countries outside of the U.S., to regulate the sales and marketing practices of certain entities including pharmaceutical and device manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure by pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to the government and/or public of financial interactions or other financial relationships with health care providers and other entities such as teaching hospitals (so-called “sunshine laws”). The Healthcare Reform Act requires manufacturers to submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. The laws and regulations include requirements that can be unclear in their scope, nature, and required implementation by regulated entities. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties and administrative actions under such laws and regulations.
Data Privacy, Security and Breach Notification
We are subject to data protection laws and regulations that set forth data privacy, security, and breach notification requirements. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on data protection and other data privacy and security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition to establishing restrictions on how personal information may be collected, used, and disclosed, these laws and regulations provide various rights to data subjects with respect to their personal information and establish requirements for how personal information must be secured. In addition, every state in the United States now has a data breach notification law that requires regulated entities to report certain security breaches to affected data subjects, regulators, or other entities. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties and requirements to take corrective actions), private litigation (which may result in the award of damages against us), and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results, business, and reputation. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are themselves subject to privacy, security, and breach notification requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, “HIPAA”). While we believe that we are neither a “covered entity” nor “business associate” subject directly to regulation under HIPAA, HIPAA’s criminal provisions can apply to entities other than “covered entities” or “business associates” in certain circumstances. Accordingly, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted. 
In addition, a growing number of jurisdictions outside of the United States have enacted robust data protection laws. Certain of these laws have extraterritorial application. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to an entity established in the EU and extraterritorially to an entity outside of the EU that offers goods or services to, or monitors the behavior of, individuals located in the EU. Certain “special categories” of personal data, including data concerning health, are subject to enhanced protections under the GDPR. This regulation imposes several requirements on the controllers and processors of personal data, including the obligation to comply with various rights that individuals have with respect to their personal data and restrictions on the processing of personal data, and to provide notice of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties.
In the United States, several state legislatures are considering enacting new data privacy legislation. One example of such legislation that has already been passed is the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and 
imposes many requirements on certain for-profit businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found in the GDPR, including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and providing data subjects various rights, such as the right to request access to their personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. In addition, the CCPA requires regulated businesses to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to protect personal information. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. It also provides California residents a private right of action, including the ability to seek statutory damages, in the event of a breach involving their personal information resulting from a business’s failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices. Compliance with the CCPA is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
On November 3, 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) through a ballot initiative. The CPRA amends the CCPA and expands its protections for personal information, including by establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce the CPRA and by providing California consumers various rights such as the right to restrict the processing of their “sensitive personal information.” The CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA take effect on January 1, 2023, and generally will apply to personal information collected by regulated businesses on or after January 1, 2022. The California Attorney General will have authority to begin enforcing the CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA beginning on July 1, 2022. 
Antitrust and Competition Laws
The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit specific types of anti-competitive conduct, including price fixing, wage fixing, concerted refusals to deal, price discrimination and tying arrangements, as well as monopolization and acquisitions of competitors that have, or may have, a substantial adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we are subject to similar antitrust and anti-competition laws in foreign countries. We believe we are in compliance with such laws, however, any violation could create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in both foreign and domestic markets. 
Laws Relating to Foreign Trade
We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Those laws also include the U.K. Bribery Act (“Bribery Act”) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.
Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Our operations reach many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods, currency, products, materials, services and technology to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries may be subjected to these laws and regulations.
Health and Safety Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the U.S. and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks related to regulatory matters.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, human health and safety in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our operations, like those of other medical product companies, involve the transport, use, handling, storage, exposure to and disposal of materials and wastes regulated under environmental laws, including hazardous and radioactive materials and wastes. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Certain environmental laws and regulations assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials or wastes at those formerly owned or operated properties or at third-party properties at which they have disposed of hazardous materials or wastes. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury, property damage or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials or wastes. We currently are not party to any claims or any obligations to investigate or remediate any material contamination at any of our facilities.
We are required to maintain a number of environmental permits and nuclear licenses for our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, which is our primary manufacturing, packaging and distribution facility. In particular, we must maintain a nuclear byproducts materials license issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This license requires that we provide financial assurance demonstrating our ability to cover the cost of decommissioning and decontaminating (“D&D”) the Billerica site at the end of its use as a nuclear facility. In addition, we have a radioactive production facility in Somerset, NJ where we must also maintain a number of environmental permits and nuclear licenses. We store low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are below regulatory limits, as allowed by our licenses and permits. As of December 31, 2020, we currently estimate the D&D cost of all of our manufacturing sites (including our Puerto Rico radiopharmacy which we sold on January 29, 2021) to be approximately $26.9 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have a liability recorded associated with the fair value of the asset retirement obligations of $14.0 million and $12.9 million, respectively. We currently provide this financial assurance in the form of surety bonds.
We also actively monitor and seek to reduce our solid waste, energy and water usage, waste water discharge and greenhouse gas emissions. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of wastes generated by our operations. In 2020, we developed a stormwater management operations and maintenance plan to minimize stormwater pollution from high impact activities. Improvements we made include (i) the regular inspection and cleaning of catch basins and piping to reduce sediment and debris wash out to adjacent wetlands; (ii) increasing street and parking lot cleaning to reduce pollutant run off; (iii) updating our snow removal plan at our North Billerica site to reduce the impact to adjacent wetlands; and (iv) using salt brine as a pretreatment for winter storms to reduce the amount of salt use and run off. 
With respect to sustainability, in 2020, we developed a mechanism to track and monitor our energy use, water use and waste generation. We use an Energy Star Portfolio Manager to track energy and water use that we believe will help us calculate associated greenhouse gas emissions and compare the performance of our North Billerica buildings against a yearly baseline, national medians, and other similar buildings.
Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. While it is not feasible to predict the future costs of ongoing environmental compliance, it is possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs that, in management’s opinion, are not likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, but could be material to the results of operations in any one accounting period.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with environmental matters.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 595 employees, of which 569 were located in the U.S. and 26 were located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Diversity, Inclusion, Ethics and Compliance
We believe that supporting our local community and instilling a diverse, inclusive, ethical and compliant culture will make us an employer of choice, maintain good standing with the regulatory authorities and customers and benefit stockholders in the long run.
We have a female CEO, 50% of our Vice Presidents and above are women, and approximately 44% of our employees are women. We continue to strive to improve our diversity and inclusion with a strategic emphasis beyond gender and we require recruiters working with us to present candidates in the spirit of diversity and inclusion.
We are committed to promoting a culture of ethics and compliance. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics reflects the Company’s commitment to corporate integrity and the underlying business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment. Each year our employees complete mandatory training that includes anti-bribery/anti-corruption rules, insider trading prohibitions, confidentiality obligations, as well as specialized training in healthcare industry marketing practices. We also have a formal Ethics and Compliance Committee that develops, implements and overseas our ethics and compliance programs.
Compensation and Benefits
We seek to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, cash bonuses and restricted stock and other equity grants to certain levels of employees, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, among others. We are focused on pay equity and regularly assess pay among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization and in comparison to our peer group. 
Communication and Engagement
We believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly town hall meetings with our executive team; (ii) regular ongoing update communications; (iii) employee engagement surveys; and (iv) an externally administered whistleblower hotline and website that is prominently advertised to our employees, and a whistleblower’s anonymity is protected, if so requested. We also established various employee recognition award programs to recognize and reward employees for specific outstanding accomplishments and to foster a positive employee relations climate.
Health, Wellness and Safety
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, patients and other partners in the healthcare community. We work to promote an environment of awareness and shared responsibility for safety and regulatory compliance throughout the Company, in order to minimize risks of injury, exposure, or business impact. 
With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, we operate a “Pandemic Response Team” to implement and oversee appropriate precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our teams and communities. We continue to have all non-critical employees and contractors work-remotely and avoid non-essential work-related travel. Further, we established a “Return to Office” team to develop plans for employees to safely return to all our facilities.
Corporate History
Founded in 1956 as New England Nuclear Corporation, our medical imaging diagnostic business was purchased by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) in 1981. Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) subsequently acquired our diagnostic medical imaging business as part of its acquisition of DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 2001. In January 2008, Avista Capital Partners, L.P., Avista Capital Partners (Offshore), L.P. and ACP-Lantern Co-Invest, LLC (collectively “Avista”) formed Lantheus Holdings and acquired our medical imaging business from BMS. On June 30, 2015, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock. We completed our acquisition of Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on June 19, 2020. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “LNTH”.
