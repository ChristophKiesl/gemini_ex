--------+---------

 We are a global provider of industrial Internet of Things (“IoT”) solutions, including network connectivity, devices, device management and web reporting applications. These solutions enable optimal business efficiencies, increased asset utilization and reduced asset write-offs, helping customers realize benefits on a worldwide basis. Our industrial IoT products and services are designed to track, monitor, control and enhance security for a variety of assets, such as trailers, trucks, rail cars, sea containers, power generators, fluid tanks, marine vessels, diesel or electric powered generators (“gensets”), oil and gas wells, pipeline monitoring equipment, irrigation control systems, and utility meters, in the transportation and supply chain, heavy equipment, fixed asset monitoring and maritime industries, as well as for governments. Additionally, we provide satellite Automatic Identification Service (“AIS”) data services to assist in vessel navigation and to improve maritime safety for government and commercial customers worldwide. We also have vehicle fleet management, as well as in-cab and vehicle fleet solutions in our transportation solution portfolio. We provide our services using multiple network platforms, including our own constellation of low-Earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites and our accompanying ground infrastructure, as well as terrestrial-based cellular communication services obtained through reseller agreements with major cellular (Tier One) wireless providers. We also offer customer solutions utilizing additional satellite network service options that we obtain through service agreements we have entered into with third-party mobile satellite providers. Our satellite-based customer solution offerings use small, low-power, mobile satellite subscriber communicators for remote asset connectivity, and our terrestrial-based solutions utilize cellular data modems with subscriber identity modules (“SIMs”). We also resell service using the two-way Inmarsat plc (“Inmarsat”) satellite network to provide higher bandwidth, low-latency satellite products and services, leveraging our IsatDataPro (“IDP”) technology. Our customer solutions provide access to data gathered over these systems through connections to other public or private networks, including the Internet. We are dedicated to providing what we believe are the most versatile, leading-edge industrial IoT solutions in our markets that enable our customers to run their business operations more efficiently and achieve significant returns on investment.

8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Credit Agreement supersedes and replaces the prior credit agreement providing for a $25.0 million revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided a senior revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and a senior term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $200.0 million (the “Term Facility” and together with the Revolving Facility, collectively the “Facilities”). The proceeds of the Facilities, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all $220.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 and pay certain related fees, expenses and accrued interest.
 The Facilities mature on December 2, 2025. At our election, loans under the Facilities will bear interest at an alternative base rate or an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus an applicable margin subject to a set pricing grid, with respect to the Revolving Facility and the Term Facility. 
 The Facilities are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all our and our subsidiaries’ assets under an Amended and Restated Security Agreement among us, our subsidiaries and JPMorgan Chase (the “Security Agreement”). The Revolving Facility has no scheduled principal amortization until the maturity date. The Term Facility has quarterly installments of principal amortization in an aggregate amount specified for each 12-month period following the closing date as set forth in the Credit Agreement
 Subject to the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement, we may borrow, repay and reborrow the Revolving Facility at any time prior to the maturity date and may prepay the Term Facility at any time without penalty or premium, subject to limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments and customary indemnification for breakage costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar Loans other than on the last day of a related interest period.
 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, conditions to funding, covenants and events of default. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit us and our subsidiaries’ ability to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) make loans and investments; (v) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; (vi) incur or permit to exist certain liens; (vii) enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; (viii) enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (ix) consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets; subject, in all cases, to certain specified exceptions. Such limitations have various baskets as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 On December 2, 2020, we redeemed all $220.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 8.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 at a price equal to (a) 104% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes being redeemed plus (b) accrued and unpaid interest, resulting in a call premium fee of $8.8 million and an additional expense associated with the remaining unamortized debt issuance cost of $2.9 million. On December 2, 2020, we borrowed $200.0 million under the Term Facility and $20.0 million under the Revolving Facility to fund in part the redemption of the Senior Secured Notes.
 At December 31, 2020, we had $200.0 million outstanding under the Term Facility and $20.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
 On August 5, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we could repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through open market transactions and privately negotiated transactions, until August 5, 2020. In addition, open market repurchases of our shares of common stock could be made pursuant to applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18, as well as Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 836,904 and 1,930,414 shares at an average share price of $2.98 and $4.86, respectively. In mid-March 2020, the Company suspended further purchases under the repurchase program given the economic uncertainty arising from the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic.
Shelf Registration
 We have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), registering up to $100.0 million of debt and/or equity securities that we may offer in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale. The shelf registration statement is due to expire on March 23, 2023 and replaces our previous shelf registration statement for an unspecified amount of debt and/or equity securities filed in 2018.
Strategic Alliance with Inmarsat 
 In early 2016, in connection with the strategic alliance with Inmarsat announced on November 4, 2013, we introduced two interchangeable modems that work with either our ORBCOMM Generation 2 (“OG2”) VHF network or Inmarsat’s L-band network. These modems have the same footprint, connectors, power input, and programming environment to allow for easy exchange of modems during the terminal manufacturing process for the different networks. Manufacturers and partners are able to place into their products the appropriate modem that corresponds with either our OG2 VHF network or Inmarsat’s L-band network based on

We have established strategic relationships with major OEMs, such as Carrier Corporation, Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment and Oshkosh Corporation / JLG Industries, Inc., as well as key VARs and IVARs, such as Precise Innovations and American Innovations in North America, along with Onixsat, Satlink S.L. and Sascar in key international markets.
 Industry Overview 
 Businesses and governments increasingly face the need to track, control, monitor and communicate with fixed and mobile assets located throughout the world. At the same these assets increasingly incorporate microprocessors, sensors and other devices that can provide a variety of information and analytical insight about the asset’s location, condition, operation and environment and are capable of responding to external commands and queries. As these intelligent devices proliferate, we believe that the need to establish two-way communications with these devices is greater than ever. The owners and operators of these intelligent devices are seeking low-cost and efficient communications systems that will enable them to communicate with these devices. 
 We operate in the industrial IoT industry, which includes various types of communications systems that enable intelligent machines, devices and fixed or mobile assets to communicate information from the machine, device, or fixed or mobile asset to and from back-office information systems of the businesses and government agencies that track, monitor, control and communicate with them. These industrial IoT data communications systems integrate a number of technologies and cross several different industries, including computer hardware and software systems, positioning systems, terrestrial and satellite communications networks and information technologies (such as data hosting and business intelligence). 
 There are four main components in any industrial IoT data communications system: 
  
1. | Devices and peripherals. Devices and sensors collect, measure, record and gather data about intelligent or trackable remote or mobile assets and their environment to be used, analyzed or otherwise disseminated to other machines, applications or human operators. For example, these devices and sensors can: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Report the location, speed and fuel economy data from trucks and locomotives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor the location, condition and environmental factors of dry van trailers, railcars and marine shipping containers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor the location, condition and temperature of refrigerated trailers, railcars and marine shipping containers that transport temperature-sensitive cargo, including remote command and control of temperature;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor vehicle fleet location, route details and fuel usage;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor driver in-cab behavior;
--+--------------------------------


• | Report operating data usage and required maintenance for heavy equipment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor fishing vessels to enforce government regulations regarding geographic and seasonal restrictions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Report the location and condition of ocean buoys;
--+--------------------------------------------------

• | Report energy consumption from a utility meter;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor corrosion in a pipeline;
--+---------------------------------


• | Monitor levels in liquid, gas and materials storage tanks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Measure water delivery in agricultural pipelines; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitor environmental conditions in agricultural facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Network connectivity and subscriber management. The communications network enables a connection to take place between the fixed or mobile asset and the back-office systems and users of that asset’s data. The proliferation of terrestrial and satellite-based wireless networks has enabled the creation of a variety of industrial IoT data communications applications. Networks that are being used to deliver asset data include terrestrial communications networks, such as cellular, radio paging and WiFi networks, and satellite communications networks, utilizing LEO or GEO satellites. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications. Data collected from a remote asset is used in a variety of ways with SaaS applications that allow the end user to track, monitor, control, communicate with and predict the behavior of these assets with a greater degree of control and with much less time and expense than would be required to do so manually. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”). Multiple devices over various networks are better managed with a device management platform, utilizing cloud-based portal technology to provide visibility and management to all devices. With a single interface for managing multiple networks and devices, connectivity and device-specific messaging is abstracted to a common interface and messaging application programming interface (API), allowing the end user to speak one language to all of their connected industrial IoT devices for complete interoperability. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity 
 We believe the following market opportunities, as well as the increasing mainstream deployment of industrial IoT solutions, will continue to position us as a leader and innovator in the global industrial IoT market. In addition, the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, the majority of which run essential businesses in the transportation, marine and heavy equipment markets and play critical roles in sustaining the world during this crisis, have reinforced the integral role of our IoT technology in maintaining their business operations, as well as ensuring visibility of their assets dispersed across large geographies. 
 Commercial transportation and distribution 
 For-hire transportation companies, including truckload carriers, shipping lines, railroads and third-party logistics providers, and the in-house transportation operations of enterprises are increasingly requiring industrial IoT telematics solutions to manage their transportation assets more safely and efficiently and to improve performance and utilization. These wireless devices report location, engine diagnostic data, fuel consumption, compliance, fuel taxes, driver electronic data logs, cargo condition, on/off utilization, empty/loaded condition, demurrage and detention, facility entry/exit, as well as a wide variety of other functions, in order to provide better control over business operations.  
 A growing number of truck and trailer fleet owners, operators and OEMs are integrating industrial IoT data communications systems into their transportation operations. In order to improve driver safety and effectively track hours of service, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration instituted regulatory requirements for Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), also known as the “ELD Mandate,” with a deadline of December 16, 2019. Similar ELD regulations have been established by the Canadian Transportation Authorities, which will be effective on June 12, 2021, as well as Electronic Work Diary (EWD) regulations developed by Australia’s National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, which were approved in November 2020. We offer what we believe is the most advanced and user-friendly ELD solution on the market for medium-to large-sized fleets, which not only enables regulatory compliance but also enables far greater operational efficiency. The trailer market also requires additional wireless applications, such as cargo sensor reporting, load monitoring, fuel measurement, control of refrigeration systems and door alarms, which we offer as part of our complete transportation solution portfolio. Future regulations may require position tracking of specific types of cargo, such as hazardous materials, and could also increase trailer tracking market opportunities. The coordination and integration of the broad collection of transportation assets, including trucks, trailers, containers, chassis and gensets, through an integrated service can provide significant benefits, synergies and savings to customers through operating efficiencies and increased logistical performance. The unified delivery of all these transport asset solutions provides a significant advantage for us, offering what we believe is the transportation industry’s most comprehensive, integrated platform for nearly all transportation assets. 
 Refrigerated or cold chain transportation shippers and transportation companies have a growing need to track and monitor environmental and control conditions and fill the visibility gap of cargo over rail, trucking and sea transport, representing an important market opportunity. Our industry-leading cold chain monitoring solutions, including those for trailers, railcars, gensets and sea 
 8


containers, address this significant market. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration’s Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) continues to impact the growth of our market opportunity in this sector as we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are informed, compliant and FSMA-ready. The FSMA ensures the safety of food across the supply chain through the introduction of new requirements for food manufacturers, processors, transporters and distributors. The FSMA requires every large food distribution company to implement wireless monitoring solutions at every step, from farm to table, which we expect will continue to increase the demand for our cold chain monitoring systems.
 Fleet management
 Enterprises that utilize large and geographically dispersed fleets of vehicles are demanding improved fleet visibility, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and improved asset management. The demand for fleet management solutions has increased due to driver hours of service regulations imposed in the United States by the ELD Mandate, innovations in workforce productivity, more efficient driver performance via electronic monitoring, and new safety applications. Wireless applications provide enterprise fleet operators with a wide variety of fleet management services, including driver hours of service compliance, asset tracking, instantaneous driver coaching and performance feedback, vehicle efficiency monitoring, fuel management, and asset utilization. We offer a driver-friendly, ELD-compliant in-cab solution to private and for-hire truck fleets. Fleet asset management is one of the largest and most dynamic markets for industrial IoT applications and offers a rapid growth opportunity for specialized solutions for in-cab telematics in the freight transportation industry.
 Fleet safety and compliance
 Commercial vehicle accidents caused by driver behavior is the most frequent and costly source of safety liability for many industrial companies. Lapses in driver behavior contribute to the majority of industrial safety-related injuries and deaths, costing billions of dollars annually. Improving fleet safety involves more than simple driver monitoring and reactive policy measures; it requires a proactive solution that provides verbal coaching to drivers in real-time to develop safer driving habits. We provide this technology, including the unique “Speed-by-StreetTM” feature, that is squarely focused on improving driver safety. This solution is the only real-time fleet safety solution that detects unsafe driver behavior, such as speeding, aggressive driving, and seat belt violations, and conducts in-cab verbal coaching, lowering the incidences of accidents and fineable offenses. Customers, particularly those in industrial environments such as oil and gas, utilities, services industries, and emergency services, increasingly benefit from safer fleet operations and better management of their drivers, expanding our reach into many new market segments.
 Manufacturing, warehousing and supply chain management
 In the increasingly complex and competitive world of manufacturing and supply chain operations, enterprises need to ensure that high-value materials, tools and supplies converge at the right time and place. Manufacturing and warehousing profitability is dependent on ensuring just-in-time availability and accurate real-time location of inventory in the supply chain. Companies employing sophisticated supply chain methods have the potential to realize greater profits than competitors using more traditional means. As regulatory pressure for buying multiple technologies rises, customers are increasingly demanding integrated solutions from single-source providers. We provide end-to-end industrial IoT solutions based on multi-modal short-range tracking technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), WiFi, condition sensors and actuators that are more capable of handling the complex demands of today’s manufacturing and supply chain operations.
 Heavy equipment 
 Heavy equipment fleet owners and leasing companies seeking to improve fleet productivity and profitability require applications that report diagnostic information, location, time-of-use information, emergency notification, driver usage and maintenance alerts for their heavy equipment, which may be in remote, difficult-to-reach locations. Using industrial IoT data communications systems, heavy equipment fleet operators can remotely manage the productivity and mechanical condition of their equipment, potentially lowering operating costs through preventive maintenance. OEMs can also use industrial IoT applications to better anticipate the maintenance and spare parts needs of their customers, expanding the market for higher-margin spare parts orders. Heavy equipment OEMs are increasingly integrating industrial IoT data communications systems into their equipment at the factory or offering them as options through certified after-market dealers. 
 Fixed asset monitoring 
 Companies with widely dispersed fixed assets, such as remote oil and gas equipment, require a means of collecting data from them to monitor productivity, manage inventory, increase security, minimize downtime and realize other operational benefits, as well as manage remote operation of valves, compressors, pumps and electrical switches. Industrial IoT systems can provide automated 
 9


meter reading, oil and gas storage tank monitoring, pipeline monitoring and environmental monitoring, which can reduce labor costs, fuel costs, and the expense of on-site monitoring and maintenance. 
 Marine 
 Marine vessels need satellite-based communications due to the absence of reliable terrestrial-based coverage more than a few miles offshore. We offer industrial IoT solutions ranging from maritime sensors on buoys to features and functions to support luxury recreational marine vessels and commercial fishing vessels. These applications include onboard diagnostics and other marine telematics, alarms, requests for assistance, security, location reporting and tracking, two-way messaging, catch data and weather reports. Owners and operators of commercial fishing and other marine vessels are increasingly subject to regulations governing, among other things, commercial fishing seasons and geographic limitations, vessel tracking, safety systems, and resource management and protection. 
 We expect to leverage our investment in satellite technology to resell our IoT data services and the AIS data collected by our network to maritime services and governmental agencies. Further expansion of our maritime business has been driven by our distribution agreements with resellers to resell the M2M and AIS data for commercial purposes.
 Government and homeland security 
 Governments worldwide are seeking to address the global terror threat by monitoring land borders and hazardous materials, as well as marine vessels and containers. In addition, modern military and public safety forces use a variety of applications, particularly in supply chain management, logistics and support, which could incorporate our products and services. Industrial IoT systems are used in applications to address infiltration across land borders by, for example, monitoring seismic sensors placed along the border to detect incursions. Industrial IoT systems are also used in applications to address homeland security requirements, such as tracking and monitoring vessels and containers. 
 Customers 
 We market and sell our products and services directly to OEM and government customers and end users, and indirectly through MCPs and MCAs, as discussed below. 
Revenues in Foreign Geographic Areas
 Revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018 in foreign geographic areas represented approximately 48%, 49% and 37% of our consolidated annual revenues, respectively, mostly in South America, Europe and Japan. Other than South America and Europe, no single foreign geographic area accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. See also “Note 12 – Segment Information” in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We generally market our services and products through the following channels: 
 Market Channel Partners (MCPs). We are currently working with a number of MCPs and seek to add additional MCPs as we expand our business. The role of the MCP is to develop tailored applications that utilize our system and then market them, through non-exclusive licenses, to specific, targeted vertical markets and geographies. MCPs are responsible for establishing retail pricing, collecting revenues from end users and for providing customer service and support. Our MCPs have made significant investments in developing ORBCOMM-based applications. MCPs pay fees for access to our system based on either a fixed monthly recurring charge or on the amount of data transmitted. 
 Generally, subject to regulatory restrictions, MCPs that have an IVAR arrangement allow us to enter into a single agreement with any given IVAR and allow the IVARs to pay directly to us a single price on a single monthly invoice in a single currency for worldwide service, regardless of the territories in which they sell, avoiding the need to negotiate prices in each territory. 
 Market Channel Affiliates (MCAs). We primarily market and distribute our services outside the United States through our subsidiary companies, several of which are overseas joint ventures, that are assigned specific international territories. We rely on these MCAs to establish business in their respective territories, including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals, as well as managing local resellers. We believe our MCAs, through their local expertise, are able to operate in these territories in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. We currently have MCAs covering over 135 countries and territories. As we seek to expand internationally, we expect to add additional MCAs to cover Asia and some regions not currently covered in Africa. We 
 10


pay our MCAs a commission on revenues received from IVARs from each subscriber activated in the specific territory assigned to the MCA.
 Direct to End Users. We also market directly to end users, providing services and products tailored to particular vertical markets, establishing retail pricing, collecting revenues and providing customer service and support. 
Competition 
 Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a satellite network operator to a multi-network service provider to an industrial IoT solutions company to today, where we offer the full industrial IoT technology stack and leverage our satellite network, as well as price competitive networks, as a key differentiator. We believe no other industrial IoT company offers more options for hardware, software, connectivity, and responsive analytics at competitive price points. However, we are not the only provider of data communication services, and our industrial IoT products and services are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants into the markets we serve. Competing service providers can be divided into four main categories: telematics and industrial IoT solution providers (including OEMs), terrestrial tower-based cellular networks, LEO mobile satellite and geostationary satellite service providers. 
 Telematics and industrial IoT solution providers
 The growth in the industrial IoT industry has led to other competitors that compete with our products and services, including system integrators, device management and open source platforms, enterprise and commercial fleets, for-hire carriers, tank monitoring applications and petroleum logistics solutions, as well as OEMs in the refrigeration and transportation markets. In addition, IoT device manufacturers are seeking to expand into solutions to increase recurring service revenue. However, our industry-leading combination of global network services along with our state-of-the-art devices, breadth of related services and robust cloud-based analytics and reporting platform, for multiple market segments, asset classes and fleets of any size, provide what we believe is the global industrial IoT market’s most comprehensive service offering and positions us as a leader and innovator in this marketplace.
 Terrestrial tower-based cellular networks 
 While terrestrial tower-based cellular networks are capable of providing services comparable to ours at higher data rates, they lack seamless global coverage. Terrestrial coverage is dependent on the location of tower transmitters, which are generally located in densely populated areas or heavily traveled routes. Several data and messaging markets, such as long-haul trucking, railroads, oil and gas, agriculture, utility distribution and heavy construction, have significant activity in sparsely populated areas with limited or no terrestrial coverage. In some geographic areas, terrestrial tower-based networks have gaps in their coverage and may require a back-up system to fill such coverage gaps. We have entered into re-seller agreements with several major Tier One cellular wireless providers to provide our customers options for incorporating terrestrial communications connectivity for industrial IoT solutions, in either single-mode or dual-mode configurations that use both terrestrial and satellite network platforms. In addition, cellular providers are expanding into IoT solutions. 
 Low-Earth orbit mobile satellite service providers 
 LEO mobile satellite service providers operating above the 1 GHz band, or big LEO systems, can provide data connectivity with global coverage that can compete with our communications services. The primary focus of big LEO satellite service providers has been on circuit-switched communications tailored for time- and bandwidth-intensive voice traffic, which is less efficient than the transfer of short data messages. However, big LEO satellite service providers have shifted to focus more on industrial IoT data communications. These systems generally entail higher costs for the satellite fleet operator and the end users. Our principal big LEO mobile satellite service competitors are Iridium Communications Inc. and, to a lesser extent, Globalstar, Inc.
 Geostationary satellite service providers 
 Geostationary satellite system operators can offer services that compete with ours. Certain pan-regional or global systems (operating in the L- or S-bands), such as Inmarsat, are designed and licensed for mobile high-speed data and voice services. We believe that the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband data communications using these systems are also higher than ours, and that these geostationary providers cannot offer global service with competitive communications devices and costs. In addition, they have other limitations, such as requiring a clear line of sight between the communicator equipment and the satellite, being affected by adverse weather or atmospheric conditions, and being vulnerable to catastrophic single-point failures of their satellites with limited backup options. In addition, we resell satellite airtime service provided by Inmarsat to meet specific customer needs.

Product Development 
 We develop products and service enhancements that we sell directly to our end-user customers, as well as design new products and services that enhance features and capabilities, while at the same time reducing costs of our products and services. 
ORBCOMM Communications System 
 Overview 
 Our industrial IoT data communications services are provided by offering a unique combination of both satellite and terrestrial networks including our proprietary LEO satellite constellation, consisting of our OG2 satellites, which are equipped with additional AIS capabilities, operating in the VHF band. In addition, we offer data communication services provided by third-party satellite constellations, such as our partnership with Inmarsat, through which we provide L-band GEO satellite service via both IDP, a satellite packet data service offering the highest payload and lowest latency in the market, and a 3G-based service, and the Globalstar, Inc. satellite network. In addition, we provide data communication services utilizing Tier One wireless carriers through partnerships with AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Telefonica, Orange, Rogers, Jersey Telecom and Vodafone, whose Access Point Name (“APN”) networks are tightly integrated into our own production network to provide a common interface for a mix of carrier and service options for our customers.
 We utilize our ORBCOMMConnect Platform to seamlessly translate and integrate the communications from our diverse network service partners into a uniform and easily manageable set of commands and responses and information delivery. This creates a common user platform for provisioning, billing and multi-mode access for industrial IoT applications and enables access to network and terminal management tools for rapid wholesale integration with our network. We sell or lease to our customers a subscriber component, which consists of satellite subscriber communicators and cellular terrestrial units, or wireless modems incorporating SIMs, used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and our system. In addition, our web applications provide specialized data feeds that are established through our application gateway interface to third-party dispatch systems and proprietary customer software applications to provide customers with data and analytics from telematics products and specialized sensors.  
 The data generated by our customer base typically comes from end-user or ORBCOMM-developed applications. The data may be transferred to either a satellite terminal or a terrestrial-based wireless device using a SIM on the partner cellular provider’s network. If the data is transferred to a satellite subscriber communicator, data is transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view in near real-time. The data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station (“GES”) that it successfully connects to, which in turn forwards it to the ORBCOMM gateway control center (“GCC”). Within the GCC, the data is processed, safe-stored, and forwarded to its ultimate destination and, if requested, an acknowledgment that the message content has been received is transmitted back to the subscriber communicators. If the data is transferred to a cellular device, data is routed through the partner carrier’s network via VPN to the ORBCOMM GCC and forwarded to its ultimate destination in real time. The destination for transferred data may be another subscriber communicator, a SIM, a corporate resource management system, any personal or business Internet e-mail address, a pager or a text message-capable cellular phone, or any combination of the above. In addition, data can be sent in the reverse direction (a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets) using similar methods. 
 System Status 
 OG1 satellites
 With the launch of the OG2 satellites, we have completed the gradual phasing out of the ORBCOMM Generation 1 (“OG1”) satellites. 
 OG2 satellites
 On July 14, 2014, we launched six of our next-generation OG2 satellites, all of which were placed into proper orbit. On September 15, 2014, following an in-orbit testing period, we initiated commercial service for the six OG2 satellites. On December 21, 2015, we launched the remaining 11 next-generation OG2 satellites, all of which were placed into proper orbit. On March 1, 2016, following an in-orbit testing period, we initiated commercial service for the 11 OG2 satellites. Of the 17 OG2 satellites placed in service, we have lost communication with six satellites including, most recently, one OG2 satellite that experienced a communication issue in October 2018 but remained under our operational control up until November 2020. In February 2021, we briefly regained operational control of this OG2 satellite. Our engineering and operations teams continue efforts to re-establish operational control of this OG2 satellite and are developing new software in an attempt to restore AIS and/or messaging services. If we are unable to regain operational control and restoration of AIS and/or messaging services on this OG2 satellite, we would write off its net book value of approximately $7.0 million as of December 31, 2020. In 2015 and 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to write off the 
 12


net book value for one OG2 satellite each year, and in 2017 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to write off the net book value of three OG2 satellites.
 In 2017, following a loss of communication with three OG2 satellites, we established a comprehensive investigative team that included outside independent consultants, internal engineers and OG2 contractors to determine the root cause of the anomalies affecting these three OG2 satellites and associated corrective measures. The investigative team identified two potential primary causes for the loss of communication and developed operational procedures and software enhancements to mitigate the risk of a similar anomaly occurring on other OG2 satellites.  The investigative team did not identify a systemic design flaw in the OG2 satellites.  The satellite network capacity remains multiple times more capable than current demand, while there has been an increase on message delivery times.
 The operational OG2 satellites are providing both M2M messaging and AIS service for our global customers. The satellites have been divided into four separate planes and were placed into differing altitudes to allow each plane to drift to the proper orbit. All of the drifting operations are complete and the OG2 satellites are equally spaced in four planes providing customers the optimum coverage.
 ORBCOMM gateways 
 The GESs in the United States and internationally are performing well. With the incorporation of an improved store and forward capability on the OG2 satellites, the reliance on multiple GESs is reduced which has afforded us the ability to take the GES located in Kazakhstan offline without a major reduction in messaging performance. In addition to routine maintenance, we continue to perform hardware and software upgrades which have improved the functionality of the GESs. Specifically, new antenna control and drive systems have been installed in several of the GESs in conjunction with the aforementioned upgrades. 
 ORBCOMM network capacity 
 With the addition of our OG2 satellites, the ORBCOMM network capacity has been increased. Each OG2 satellite has up to six times the capacity of the OG1 satellites because each OG2 satellite has six downlink transmitters where the OG1 satellites had only one. Currently, the OG2 satellites are meeting our capacity needs with just two downlink channels per satellite.
 Inmarsat Services
 In October 2020, ORBCOMM and Inmarsat entered a long-term agreement to provide IoT services and solutions expected through at least 2035. In addition, ORBCOMM and Inmarsat will be developing a next-generation service called OGx, which incorporates the current IDP service and will feature new offerings to suit future customer demand. The OGx network is expected to become available in 2022.
 This agreement also transitions the primary operational control of the IDP services to ORBCOMM.  For 2020, while under the operational control of Inmarsat, the system performance was over 99.6% network availability.  For the legacy IsatM2M services, we provide operational support to Inmarsat’s engineering and operations teams. The IsatM2M services are nearly at their end of life planned for December 2021.  Over the past several years, our customers have been replacing their IsatM2M devices with IDP devices, and we expect such replacements to continue for the remainder of 2021. Like the IDP services, network availability for IsatM2M services has been consistent and reliable. 
 For both the IDP and IsatM2M services, we remain in control of the message delivery gateway that is the interface to our customers for message delivery.  The gateway is a redundant system providing customer access via two independent Internet lines which offer connectivity to their mobile terminals and messages over multiple transports and protocols.  It is a high-availability system responsible for connection, storing and relaying messages between customers and Inmarsat satellite network systems, as well as providing terrestrial messaging services between customers and mobile terminals.
 
Terrestrial Services 
 We have active partnerships with many of the major terrestrial carriers, both domestically and abroad, including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Telefonica, Orange, Rogers, Jersey Telecom and Vodafone. We have tightly integrated each carrier’s APN into our production network to provide a common interface for a mix of carrier and service options for our customers. The integration planning of each carrier network is at the core of our goal to provide a consistent and reliable uniform messaging environment over a variety of networks. We maintain redundant connections to carriers through an East Coast primary data center and West Coast backup data center. Our Network Control Center, staffed 24 hours a day, monitors all aspects of the network to ensure prompt response to network anomalies when they occur. Aside from a traditional Network Management System utilizing Simple Network Management Protocol for infrastructure monitoring, device and carrier specific tests simulate customer traffic and provide performance metrics for support staff and engineers. A three-tier support structure is employed to ensure that staff with domain specific knowledge are quickly assigned to address anomalies and implement resolutions.

AIS Services
 Our AIS data services are provided through a combination of our OG2 satellites, which are all enabled with advanced AIS data receivers, and third-party space-based assets and terrestrial AIS data providers.
 Regulation of Our Business in the United States 
 FCC authorizations 
 Any entity seeking to construct, launch, or operate a commercial satellite system in the United States must first be licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). ORBCOMM License Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, holds the FCC license for our VHF LEO Satellite System (the “Space Segment License”). ORBCOMM License Corp. also holds additional FCC licenses relating to our United States GESs, and our VHF and L-band subscriber communicator deployments in the United States. We believe that our business, as currently conducted, is in full compliance with all applicable FCC rules, policies and license conditions.  
 FCC license renewals 
 The current 15-year term of our Space Segment License expires in April 2025, and the renewal application must be filed between 30 and 90 days prior to the end of the twelfth year of the current license term (i.e., between 30 and 90 days prior to April 2022). The current FCC earth station licenses for three of the four the U.S. GESs expire on May 17, 2035. The FCC license for the fourth U.S. GES and the “blanket” VHF subscriber communicator license expire on June 12, 2035. Our two L-band subscriber communicator licenses expire on January 22, 2034 and April 19, 2026, respectively. Renewal applications for our FCC earth station licenses must be filed between 30 and 90 days prior to expiration. Although the FCC has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license renewals, there can be no assurance that the FCC will in fact grant our earth station license renewals, or renew our other FCC licenses in the future. 
 We believe that our business as currently conducted is in full compliance with all applicable FCC rules, policies, and license conditions. We also believe that we will have the ability to continue to comply with all applicable FCC requirements, although we cannot provide assurance that will be the case. 
 Non-common carrier status 
 All of our FCC licenses authorize our provision of commercial services on a “non-common carrier” basis. As a result, our service offerings are subject to limited FCC regulations, and we are not required to comply with the obligations, restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to common carriers or to providers of Commercial Mobile Radio Services, or CMRS. There can be no assurance, however, that in the future, we will not be deemed by the FCC to provide services that are designated common carrier or CMRS, or that the FCC will not exercise its discretionary authority to apply its common carrier or CMRS rules and regulations to our service offerings. If this were to occur, we would be subject to FCC obligations that include record retention requirements, limitations on use or disclosure of customer proprietary network information and truth-in-billing regulations. In addition, we would need to obtain FCC approval for foreign ownership in excess of 25% and authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to provide international services. Finally, we would be subject to additional reporting obligations with regard to international traffic and circuits, and Equal Employment Opportunity Act compliance. 
 United States regulatory controls
 We are subject to U.S. import and export control laws and regulations, specifically the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and the Export Administration Regulations.  We are also subject to other regulatory regimes, including trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we believe we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations. We also believe that we have obtained all the specific authorizations currently needed to operate our business and believe that the terms of the relevant licenses are sufficient given the scope and duration of the activities to which they pertain. We are also subject to the increasing data privacy regulatory regimes being implemented in various states and foreign countries with regard to data privacy, controls and information security obligations.  We believe that our processes, procedures and security measures meet the requirements of those regimes. 
 14


Regulation of Our Business in Other Countries 
 Our business and our business objectives are inherently worldwide, and our product and service offerings are subject to national telecommunication regulation and other applicable laws and regulations of every country in which we, our MCAs, and our MCPs conduct business. These other applicable laws and regulations include various European Union compliance obligations, the UK Bribery Act, the General Data Protection Regulation, and other national privacy and information security compliance regimes in countries, including Canada, Australia, Argentina, China and Brazil. These rules and policies, all of which are subject to change from time to time without prior notice, specify technical parameters for the operation of network facilities and subscriber communicators, determine the permissible uses of network facilities and subscriber communicators, and otherwise establish the terms and conditions pursuant to which our products and services can be offered and utilized in any given country. As a result, we, our MCAs, our MCPs and, in some cases, our respective customers, must comply with various overseas legal and regulatory regimes, and obtain and maintain requisite local regulatory and other governmental approvals in each country where our product and services are offered and utilized. The process for obtaining the applicable regulatory authorization varies from country to country, and in some instances may require technical studies or actual experimental field tests under the direction and/or supervision of the local regulatory authority. Certain countries continue to require that some or all telecommunications services be provided by a government-owned or controlled entity. Therefore, under such circumstances, we may be required to offer our products or services through a government-owned or controlled entity. Failure to obtain or maintain any requisite authorizations in any given country could mean that some or all of our products and services may not be provided or utilized in that country.
 We believe, but cannot provide assurance that we, our MCAs, our MCPs, and our customers are in compliance with all applicable laws and policies and have obtained all necessary regulatory or other governmental approvals required to conduct our respective current business activities in each of the countries where we currently operate. However, it may not be possible for us, our MCAs, our MCPs, and our customers to maintain compliance with all applicable laws and policies, or obtain, modify, or maintain requisite regulatory or other governmental approvals in the future. Moreover, future changes in applicable regulatory or governmental approval requirements may result in disruptions of our ability to provide or utilize some or all of the products and services we offer in one or more countries, or alternatively, result in added operational costs, which could materially harm our business.
 Non-U.S. GESs for our satellite constellation 
 To date, in addition to those in the United States, GESs for our VHF satellite constellation have been authorized and deployed in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Curaçao, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Morocco, South Africa and South Korea. GESs are generally licensed on an individual facility basis. This process normally entails radio frequency coordination within the country of operation for the specific frequencies to be used in the designated geographic location of the subject GES. This domestic frequency coordination is in addition to any international coordination that may be required, as determined by the proximity of the GES location to foreign borders (see “— International Regulation of Our VHF LEO Satellite System” below). Based on the best available information, we believe that each of the GES authorizations is sufficient for the provision of our VHF satellite constellation services in the areas served by the relevant facilities. We will need additional GES authorizations in other countries as we install additional ORBCOMM GESs around the world. 
 Equipment standards 
 Each manufacturer of the applicable subscriber communicator is contractually responsible to obtain and maintain the governmental authorizations necessary to operate their subscriber communicators in each jurisdiction. Most countries generally require all radio transmission equipment used within their borders to comply with operating standards that may include specifications relating to required minimum acceptable levels for radiated power, power density and spurious emissions into adjacent frequency bands not allocated for the intended use. Technical criteria established by telecommunications equipment standards issued by the FCC and/or the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, or ETSI, are generally accepted and/or closely duplicated by domestic equipment approval regulations in most countries. To the best of our knowledge, all of the subscriber communicator models that we, our MCAs, and our MCPs offer on the market comply with established FCC and ETSI standards. 
 International Regulation of Our VHF LEO Satellite System 
 The use of certain orbital planes and related system radio frequency assignments by our VHF LEO Satellite System, as licensed by the FCC, is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). In order to protect satellite systems from harmful radio frequency interference from other satellite communications systems, the ITU maintains a Master International Frequency Register (“MIFR”) of radio frequency assignments and their associated orbital locations. Each ITU member state (referred to as an administration) is required by treaty to give notice of, coordinate and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations with the ITU’s Radio Communication Bureau. 
 15


The FCC serves as the notifying administration for the United States and is responsible for filing and coordinating the allocated radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations for our VHF LEO Satellite System with both the ITU’s Radio Communication Bureau and the national administrations of other countries. While the FCC, as our notifying administration, is responsible for coordinating our VHF LEO Satellite System, in practice the satellite licensee is generally responsible for identifying any potential interference concerns with existing systems or those enjoying date priority and for coordinating with such systems. If we are unable to reach agreement and finalize coordination, the FCC would then assist with such coordination. 
 The FCC has notified the ITU that our VHF LEO Satellite System was initially placed into service in April 1995 and that it has operated without any substantiated complaints of interference since that time. The FCC has also informed the ITU that our system has successfully completed the international coordination process and has been formally registered in the MIFR. We continue to support FCC efforts to complete any additional required international coordination relating to our system and our new satellites, as necessary. If design modifications we may make to our future satellites entail substantial changes to the frequency utilization by the subject system component(s), additional international coordination may be required or reasonably deemed advisable. However, we believe that ITU coordination can be successfully completed in all circumstances where such coordination is required, although we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully complete such ITU coordination. Failure to complete requisite ITU coordination could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless, to date, and to our best knowledge, the system has not caused harmful interference to any other radio system, or suffered harmful interference from any other radio system. 
 Intellectual Property
 We use and hold intellectual property rights for a number of trademarks, service marks and logos for our system. We have two main marks — “ORBCOMM” — which is registered or is pending registration in approximately 125 countries and the ORBCOMM logo, which is represented by the ORBCOMM name in black type with a distinctive red graphic within the second “O.” 
 The telematics solutions services provided by our affiliates use trademarks, including FLEETEDGE®, REEFERTRAK® and CARGOWATCH®” that are registered in the U.S. and numerous countries around the world. Other trademarks, such as “GLOBALTRAK,” are seeking registration only in the U.S., while others, such as “STARTRAKTM” and “VESSELCONNECTTM,” are subject to common law protection. In addition, we have the R:COM® trademark registered in the U.S. and European Community and “BLUE TREE SYSTEMS & DEVICE” registered in the European Community.
 Our telematics solutions services are protected by approximately 100 patents maintained across the United States, Europe, Australia, China, Mexico and Canada.  We also have a significant number of pending patent applications relating to our devices and solutions services. Further, we expect to file additional patent applications in the appropriate countries to protect our technology investments and innovations. 
 We believe that all intellectual property rights used in our system were independently developed or duly licensed by us, by those we license the rights from or by the technology companies who supplied portions of our system. We cannot provide assurance, however, that third parties will not bring suit against us for patent or other infringement of intellectual property rights. 
 The value of intellectual property assets recorded for accounting purposes is primarily related to technology-based intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. 
 Human Capital
 Employees
 In order for us to be successful in the long run, we have invested in our employees, taking a local approach towards development, engagement and retention. We have over 700 employees across the globe, with approximately 303 employees in the United States and approximately 423 employees outside the United States in North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. We believe we have developed a collaborative and dynamic workplace where our people look forward to coming every day, contributing to and building a successful future for the Company. In keeping with our philosophy of investing in our employees, the vast majority, 739, of the people who work with us are full time and 57 are contractors or part time employees. As of December 31, 2020, our employee population was engaged in the following functions: approximately 20% in administration, 14% in sales and marketing, 41% in product development and 25% in technical operations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Company Culture
 All employees adhere to and take an active role in supporting our core values expressed in our Code of Conduct, which helps us ensure that everyone is focused on making it a safe, inclusive and ethical place to work. To ensure our employees know and understand how to participate in developing an ethical culture, we poll our employees annually to gauge what areas we need to 
 16


improve, making our employees part of the solution. We maintain a 24/7 ethics hotline, which can be reached by phone, email or via a web-based interface.
 Every employee has a voice at the Company.  Through our annual employee survey, our employees know that their opinions and issues are valued. We have received responses in the high or very high categories from a significant majority of our employees with respect to their recommending us as a good place to work, their level of satisfaction as an employee of ours and their likelihood of remaining an employee in two years.  We believe that these results indicate that we have a significantly stable workforce.
Compensation and Benefits
 We provide robust compensation and benefit programs to attract, retain and meet the needs of our employees.  Through various equity plans, every full-time employee has an opportunity to own shares of our stock and are incentivized to support our growth and success.  In addition, our 401(k) Plan and other generally available benefit programs allow us to remain competitive in our markets with respect to recruiting new employee talent, and we believe that these benefit programs enhance employee productivity and loyalty to the Company. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 We embrace and encourage our employees’ differences. As a global company, we believe that it is the differences that make us a stronger company. Our differences allow a diversity of ideas on which we are built.  We encourage the professional development of our employees through management sponsored empowerment groups, such as our Women’s Professional Network, which provides a forum for women to network with and mentor each other. We also continue to provide mandatory harassment and sensitivity training for our employees to promote inclusion and equality within the Company. As a result of these efforts, over 93% of our employees feel as though they are treated with respect by their coworkers.  
Health and Safety
 At ORBCOMM, the safety, health and welfare of our employees is a priority. While most of our employees work in the relative safety of an office setting, our staff often visit customer sites to install our devices in their truck fleets or shipping containers.  Despite the inherent risks of working in places such as truck depots, trainyards, shipyards, and oil and gas refineries, no employee suffered a workplace injury in 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the various government-issued work from home orders, we have facilitated remote work for the majority of our employees. For employees who were considered essential employees according to state definitions and were required to either work in an office setting or visit customers for on-site support, we provided appropriate personal protection equipment to ensure our employee’s health and safety.
