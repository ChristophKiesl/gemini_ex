Description of the Business
Overview
Cronos Group is an innovative global cannabinoid company with international production and distribution across five continents. Cronos Group is committed to building disruptive intellectual property by advancing cannabis research, technology and product development and are building an iconic brand portfolio. Cronos Group’s brand portfolio includes PEACE NATURALS™, a global wellness platform; two adult-use brands, COVE™ and Spinach™; and three U.S. hemp-derived consumer products brands, Lord Jones™, Happy Dance™ and PEACE+™.
Strategy
Cronos Group seeks to create value for shareholders by focusing on four core strategic priorities:
•growing a portfolio of iconic brands that responsibly elevate the consumer experience;
•developing a diversified global sales and distribution network;
•establishing an efficient global supply chain; and
•creating and monetizing disruptive intellectual property.
Business Segments
Cronos Group reports through two segments: “United States” and “Rest of World.” These two segments represent the geographic regions in which the Company operates and the different product offerings within each geographic region. 
United States
On September 5, 2019, as a result of the acquisition (the “Redwood Acquisition”) of four Redwood Holding Group, LLC subsidiaries (collectively, “Redwood”), the Company established the United States segment. Redwood manufactures, markets and distributes U.S. hemp-derived supplements and cosmetic products through e-commerce, retail and hospitality partner channels in the United States under the brands Lord Jones™ and Happy Dance™. 
No U.S. Schedule I Cannabis-Related Activities 
On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was enacted in the U.S., removing U.S. hemp from the list of Schedule I controlled substances under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), and on January 19, 2021, the USDA issued a final rule establishing a domestic U.S. hemp production regulatory program, effective March 2021. Though a number of states in the U.S. have authorized the cultivation, distribution or possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis and U.S. Schedule I cannabis containing products to various degrees and subject to various requirements or conditions, U.S. Schedule I cannabis continues to be a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Therefore, the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and possession of U.S. Schedule I cannabis violates federal law in the U.S. unless a U.S. federal agency, such as the DEA, grants a registration for a specific activity, such as research, with U.S. Schedule I cannabis.
We do not engage in any activities related to U.S. Schedule I cannabis in the U.S. The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids, but such activities are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances. 
Rest of World
The Rest of World operating segment is involved in the cultivation, manufacture, and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets. 
In Canada, Cronos Group operates through a wholly owned license holder under the Cannabis Act (Canada) (the “Cannabis Act”), Peace Naturals Project Inc. (“Peace Naturals”), which has production facilities near Stayner, Ontario (the “Peace Naturals Campus”). Cronos Group has established four strategic joint ventures in Canada, Israel and Colombia and holds approximately 31% of the issued capital of Cronos Australia Limited (“Cronos Australia”), which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the trading symbol “CAU.” Cronos Group currently exports cannabis products to countries that permit the import of such products, such as Germany, Israel and Australia. 
Peace Naturals
The production facilities at the Peace Naturals Campus are licensed by Health Canada under the Cannabis Act to engage in, among other things, the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of dried cannabis flower, cannabis resin, cannabis seeds, cannabis plants, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and cannabis edibles, among other prescribed activities.
Joint Ventures/Strategic Investment
We have established four strategic joint ventures in Canada, Israel and Colombia and also hold approximately 31% of the issued capital of Cronos Australia, which we account for under the equity method of accounting.
Our ownership interest in each of our joint ventures is summarized in the table below. 

Joint Venture | Jurisdiction | Ownership Interest(i)
Cronos Israel(ii) | Israel | 70%/90% 
Cronos Growing Company Inc. (“Cronos GrowCo”)(iii) | Canada | 50% 
NatuEra S.à.r.l. (“Natuera”) (iv) | Colombia | 50% 
MedMen Canada Inc. (“MedMen Canada”)(v) | Canada | 50% 

(i)    We define ownership interest as the proportionate share of net income to which we are entitled; equity interest may differ from ownership interest shown above. We consolidate the financial results of Cronos Israel and account for our other joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
(ii)    A strategic joint venture with Kibbutz Gan Shmuel (“Gan Shmuel”), an Israeli agricultural collective settlement, for the production, manufacture and global distribution of medical cannabis, consisting of a cultivation company (Cronos Israel G.S. Cultivation Ltd.), a manufacturing company (Cronos Israel G.S. Manufacturing Ltd.), a distribution company (Cronos Israel G.S. Store Ltd.) and a pharmacy company (Cronos Israel G.S. Pharmacy Ltd., collectively, “Cronos Israel”). We hold a 70% equity interest in the cultivation company and a 90% equity interest in each of the manufacturing, distribution and pharmacy companies.
(iii)    A strategic joint venture with a group of investors led by Bert Mucci (the “Greenhouse Partners”), a Canadian large-scale greenhouse operator. Each of Cronos Group and the Greenhouse Partners owns a 50% equity interest in Cronos GrowCo and has equal representation on its board of directors.
(iv)    A strategic joint venture with an affiliate of Agroidea SAS (“AGI”), a Colombian agricultural services provider. Each of the Company and AGI owns a 50% equity interest in Natuera. Cronos Group has three manager nominees on the board of managers of Natuera, while AGI has four manager nominees on the board of managers. Natuera intends to develop, cultivate, manufacture, and export cannabis-based medical and consumer products for the Latin American and global markets.
(v)    A strategic joint venture with MedMen Enterprises USA, LLC (“MedMen”) for retail in provinces in Canada that permit private retail. Each of the Company and MedMen owns a 50% equity interest in MedMen Canada, and has equal representation on the board of directors of MedMen Canada.
Operations Outside of Canada and the U.S.
Cronos Group anticipates expanding in the geographic markets outside of Canada and the U.S. in which we currently participate and entering new geographic markets. By leveraging operational, manufacturing and regulatory expertise, quality standards and procedures and intellectual property, we believe that we are well-positioned to effectively access these markets. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, strategic international business opportunities pursued by us could include:
•production, distribution, sales and marketing in jurisdictions which have passed legislation to legalize the production, distribution and possession of cannabis and cannabis products at all relevant levels of government; and
•the export of cannabis and cannabis products to markets that permit the import of such products.
We seek to conduct business only in jurisdictions where we believe it is legal to do so and where such operations remain compliant with our listing obligations with the TSX and Nasdaq. Determining whether a business activity is legal in a jurisdiction may require judgment since laws, rules, regulations and licenses may not be clear and legal interpretation and advice of counsel may vary. If a business activity in which we engage in any jurisdiction is determined to be illegal, we could be subject to fines, penalties, reputational harm, delisting from securities exchanges and material civil, criminal and regulatory litigation and proceedings or be enjoined from doing business in the applicable jurisdiction. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Regulation and Compliance - We operate in highly regulated sectors where the regulatory environment is rapidly developing, and we may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we carry on business.”

Rest of World
Canadian Market and Distribution
•Direct-to-Client. We currently sell dried cannabis and cannabis extracts directly to clients through our wellness platform, PEACE NATURALS™. These clients are typically sourced through physician and clinic referrals or word-of-mouth recommendations from existing clients. 
•Adult-Use. We currently sell dried flower, pre-rolls and cannabis extracts through our adult-use brands, COVE™ and Spinach™, to cannabis control authorities in various provinces, including Ontario, Québec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as to private-sector retailers in Saskatchewan, subject to the relevant province’s product or other restrictions and requirements. As the Company’s supply chain grows, the Company continues to expand its portfolio of cannabis products for the existing markets in Canada. The rate of the Company’s expansion of distribution remains subject to factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including evolving regulations, the development of sufficient supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure and development of distribution and retail channels across Canada. 
Markets and Distribution Outside of Canada 
•Israel. Cronos Israel has received the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel. In the second quarter of 2020, Cronos Israel began distributing PEACE NATURALS™ branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical cannabis market. See “- Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel.”
•Europe. We have distributed and anticipate continuing to distribute PEACE NATURALS™ branded cannabis products in Germany through an exclusive distribution relationship with G. Pohl-Boskamp GmbH & Co. KG (“Pohl-Boskamp”), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and distributor with a distribution network of pharmacies. We have also entered into a strategic distribution partnership with Delfarma Sp. Zo.o (“Delfarma”), a pharmaceutical wholesaler in Poland. We and Delfarma are currently in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to sell cannabis products in Poland.
•Latin America. We intend to distribute cannabis and cannabis products to the Latin American and other cannabis markets through the operations of Natuera. In 2020, Natuera began commercial cultivation of non-psychoactive (hemp) cultivars registered with the Colombian Agricultural Institute. Also in 2020, Natuera completed a number of test exports of hemp-derived CBD extract to the U.S. and United Kingdom for business development and R&D purposes, as well as its first export of hemp-derived CBD extract to the U.S. for commercial purposes.
•Australia and Asia-Pacific. Cronos Australia has received an import license from the Australian Office of Drug Control (the “ODC”), together with all necessary permits, to import PEACE NATURALS™ branded cannabis products for sale in the Australian medical market under the terms of the relevant permits. Cronos Australia facilitates distribution of the Company’s products in Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia, bolstering the Company’s distribution network in the Australia and Asia-Pacific region.
We continue to seek new international distribution channels in jurisdictions that have legalized the production, distribution and possession of cannabis and cannabis products at all relevant levels of government.
Global Supply Chain
Cronos Group is focused on establishing an efficient global supply chain by seeking to develop industry-leading methodologies and best practices at the Peace Naturals Campus and leveraging this expertise to create beneficial production partnerships. We plan to continue to develop a global supply chain, which will employ a combination of wholly owned production facilities, third-party suppliers and global production partnerships, all of which will support the manufacturing of cannabinoid-based consumer goods. 
United States
In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into contract manufacturing agreements with suppliers of our cosmetic products. We supply these third-party manufacturers with U.S. hemp extract or infused bulk product, fragrances and/or packaging that we source from other third-party suppliers. The contract manufacturers supply any other necessary ingredients to manufacture products using our formulas and fill and package our finished products. Our contract manufacturing and supply agreements generally do not require us to purchase minimum quantities of materials or products.
In producing our supplement products, we source our ingredients from our suppliers on an ongoing as-needed basis. We have not entered into any contracts that obligate us to purchase a minimum quantity or exclusively from any supplier. Our supplements are manufactured at our facilities in Los Angeles, California according to Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). 
We are obligated to purchase our supply of certain U.S. hemp extract from one supplier unless that supplier cannot provide the agreed-upon quantities in relation to certain brands in the U.S.
Rest of World 
Canadian Supply Chain
•Production Facilities at Peace Naturals. The Peace Naturals Campus is licensed for cannabis production and the manufacturing of certain cannabis products. The production processes at the Peace Naturals Campus are GMP-certified under relevant European Economic Area GMP directives by the national competent authority of Germany. The Peace Naturals Campus is engaged in cultivation, processing, finishing, packaging and shipping activities, as well as tissue culture and micro propagation, providing a year-round supply of cannabis. The Peace Naturals Campus also engages in R&D to pilot various production technologies, with any tests yielding favorable operational improvements evaluated for dissemination to the Company’s other partnership facilities.

In November 2020, Cronos GrowCo obtained a cultivation license for the operations contemplated by the first phase of the project. The Company expects the facility to become operational in phases beginning in the first half of 2021. Full commencement of operations at Cronos GrowCo will be subject to obtaining the appropriate licenses and other customary approvals under applicable law.
•Third-Party Supply and Manufacturing Agreements. In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into spot market purchase agreements and supply agreements with suppliers of dried cannabis and other cannabis products. Our supply agreements, for the most part, do not obligate us to purchase minimum quantities of products and generally contain provisions permitting cancellation of orders or termination on notice. We also enter into contract manufacturing agreements with other license holders, pursuant to which such license holders provide cannabis extract and services related to the filling and packaging of vaporizer devices for the Canadian cannabis adult-use and wellness markets.
Supply Chain Outside of Canada 
•Cronos Israel. Cronos Israel has received the IMC-GAP, IMC-GMP and IMC-GDP certifications required for the cultivation, production and marketing of dried flower, pre-rolls and oils in Israel. In the second quarter of 2020, Cronos Israel began distributing PEACE NATURALS™ branded cannabis products to the Israeli medical cannabis market. See “- Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel.”

Major Customers
Four major customers (sales to each of which equaled or exceeded 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020), Alberta Gambling and Liquor Commission, B.C. Liquor Distribution Branch, Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation, and Société Québécoise du Cannabis (the “SQDC”) (the cannabis control authorities in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Québec, respectively), accounted for approximately 19%, 13%, 16% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We mitigate credit risk through verification of the customers’ liquidity prior to the authorization of material transactions.
Government Contracts
In Canada, we sell cannabis and cannabis products to cannabis control authorities in various provinces, including, Ontario, Québec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, where each such cannabis control authority is the sole wholesale distributor and in certain provinces, the sole retailer, of cannabis and cannabis products. We sell these products to the various cannabis control authorities under supply agreements that are subject to terms that allow for renegotiation of sale prices and termination at the election of the applicable cannabis control authority. In particular, the cannabis control authorities have in the past and may in the future choose to stop purchasing our products, may change the prices at which they purchase our products, may return our products to us and, in certain circumstances, may cancel purchase orders at any time including after products have been shipped. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we had approximately $36.4 million in sales to cannabis control authorities.
Research and Development Activities and Intellectual Property
Cronos Research Labs 
Cronos Research Labs Ltd. (“Cronos Research Labs”) is our Israel-based global research and development center for innovation. The state-of-the-art facility is equipped with advanced technology and analytical testing infrastructure and is home to an experienced team of scientific talent. The Cronos Research Labs team is comprised of scientific researchers, mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and analytical and formulation scientists. Cronos Group engages in both understanding the fundamental science behind the interactions of cannabinoids with each other and how those interactions can be leveraged to best deliver on the consumer’s needs. Cronos Group’s work spans many aspects of cannabis research from strain development, to growing conditions to extraction technology to biosynthesis to product development, all supported by advances in analytical sciences. This global R&D center is expected to significantly enhance Cronos Group’s innovation capabilities and accelerate development of the next-generation of cannabinoid products. 
Ginkgo 
The collaboration and license agreement between Ginkgo and the Company (the “Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement”) could enable us to produce certain cultured cannabinoids at commercial scale at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional cultivation practices. These cultured cannabinoid molecules are identical to those produced by plants grown using traditional cultivation but are created by leveraging the power of biological manufacturing via fermentation. In addition to tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and CBD, these cultured cannabinoids include rare cannabinoids that are economically impractical or nearly impossible to produce at high purity and scale through traditional cultivation.
If the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership is ultimately successful, Cronos Group expects to be able to produce large volumes of these cultured cannabinoids from custom yeast strains by leveraging existing fermentation infrastructure at Cronos Fermentation in Winnipeg, Manitoba without incurring significant capital expenditures to build new cultivation and extraction facilities.
The Ginkgo Strategic Partnership contemplates the performance of licensed R&D activities in the U.S. in order to produce cultured cannabinoids and such activities are to be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws regarding controlled substances. We intend to produce and distribute the target cannabinoids globally, where permitted by applicable law, and have received confirmation from Health Canada that this method of production is permitted under the Cannabis Act. 
Ginkgo has filed certain patent applications pertaining to biosynthesis of cannabinoids to protect the intellectual property developed as part of the research progressing under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership. Under the partnership, Cronos Group is the exclusive licensee of the intellectual property covered by the patent applications for the target cannabinoids. 
Cronos Fermentation 
Cronos Fermentation is a GMP-standard fermentation and manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The state-of-the-art facility includes fully equipped laboratories covering microbiology, organic and analytical chemistry, quality control and method development as well as two large-scale microbial fermentation production areas, three downstream processing plants, and bulk product and packaging capabilities. The facility is expected to provide the fermentation and manufacturing capabilities we need in order to capitalize on the progress underway with Ginkgo, by enabling us to produce the target cannabinoids contemplated under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement at commercial scale with high quality and high purity.
We have begun to work on developing scale-up and downstream processes at Cronos Fermentation, while in parallel Ginkgo develops microorganisms for producing cultured compounds. As we develop the processes and parameters, these learnings will be used for the strains that will be used for commercial production of cultured cannabinoids. Commercial production at the facility is subject to completion of the equipment alignment for cannabinoid-based production, the receipt of the appropriate licenses from Health Canada for the production of cultured cannabinoids under the Cannabis Act and the achievement of the relevant milestones under the Ginkgo Strategic Partnership.
The Company is prioritizing rare cannabinoids, such as CBG, over common cannabinoids, such as THC and CBD, and will be sequencing commercial production and subsequent product launches based upon this approach. The Company currently expects to achieve its first equity milestone by the third quarter of 2021. The achievement of equity milestones for the remaining seven target cannabinoids will occur sequentially based on the Company’s future commercialization plans, which will depend on consumer insights, customer preferences and competitive opportunities.
Technion Skin Health Research Partnership
We have a sponsored research agreement (the “Technion Research Agreement”) with the Technion Research and Development Foundation of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (“Technion”) to explore the use of cannabinoids and their role in regulating skin health and skin disorders. Preclinical studies are being conducted by Technion over a three-year period and will focus on three skin conditions: acne, psoriasis and skin repair.
Research is led by Technion faculty members Dr. David “Dedi” Meiri and Dr. Yaron Fuchs, two of the world’s leading researchers in cannabis and skin stem cell research, respectively. Dr. Meiri heads the Laboratory of Cannabis and Cancer Research with vast experience in cannabis and endocannabinoid research. Dr. Fuchs heads the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine with years of experience in the biology of the skin and its pathologies. Development and implementation of the research is being conducted at Technion’s Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Cannabis Research and the Lorry I. Lokey Interdisciplinary Center of Life Sciences and Engineering in Haifa, Israel.
Enterprise Initiatives
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system across the Canadian business. Cronos Group has also commenced work to broaden the scope of our ERP system to the U.S. business, which is currently expected to be launched in the first half of 2021. The new ERP system will be a meaningful component of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and is expected to enable us to realize efficiencies throughout our supply chain and operations.
Competitive Conditions
Competitive Conditions in the United States
We face competition in all aspects of our business in the U.S. hemp market. In addition to numerous small companies and brands, we compete with larger, national companies that may have larger distribution capabilities with more developed and efficient supply chain operations. The principal factors on which we compete with other U.S. hemp brands are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price. We believe the Company’s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, along with the Lord Jones™, Happy Dance™ and PEACE+™ brand equity, recognition and differentiation in the U.S. hemp retail channel, will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our U.S. hemp business and strengthen our market position in the U.S. However, rapidly evolving and developing federal and state regulatory frameworks affect all areas of our business and could result in our inability to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. See “ -U.S. Hemp Regulatory Framework” for further information on regulatory framework on U.S. hemp.
Rest of World
Competitive Conditions in Canada
We face competition in all aspects of our business in the Canadian medical and adult-use markets. As the demand for cannabis increases as a result of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada under the Cannabis Act, we believe that new competitors will continue to enter the market. 
The principal factors on which we compete with other Canadian license holders are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition and price. We believe the Company’s strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment will enable us to provide better quality consumer products, grow our Canadian business and strengthen our market position in Canada. However, a rapidly evolving and stringent federal regulatory framework affects all areas of our business. See “—Regulatory Framework in Canada” for further information on the regulatory framework applicable to our Canadian business.
We also face competition from illegal market participants that are unlicensed and unregulated. As these illegal market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry, their operations may also have significantly lower costs. Any inability of the Canadian federal or provincial law enforcement authorities to enforce existing laws prohibiting the unlicensed cultivation and sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products could result in the perpetuation of the illegal market for cannabis.
Competitive Conditions in Europe and Israel 
We face competition when entering new markets in Europe and in Israel. The principal factors on which we compete are product quality, innovation, intellectual property, brand recognition, price and physician familiarity. We believe we are positioned to enter certain markets in Europe and Israel in a meaningful way while continuing to operate and penetrate the markets we currently serve, such as in Israel and Germany, due to our strong capitalization resulting from the Altria Investment, extensive experience and expertise in the highly regulated cannabis industry in Canada, which can be leveraged when entering new markets or growing existing operations, and strong partnerships with local pharmaceutical distributors. We believe these factors will enable us to develop greater market penetration, provide a greater variety of quality consumer products and enter into new markets and strengthen our existing market position in Europe and Israel. However, a patchwork of regulatory frameworks and federal regulations in these various regions also affect our ability to compete in emerging markets as evolving regulations and federal frameworks have the potential to affect all areas of our business.

As of December 31, 2020, Altria beneficially owned 156,573,537 of our common shares, had the right to acquire up to an additional 80,056,296 common shares on or prior to March 8, 2023 under the Altria Warrant, which has not been exercised, and the right to acquire additional common shares under its pre-emptive and top-up rights as discussed under “Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights” below.
Investor Rights Agreement
In connection with the Altria Investment, we entered into the investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with Altria pursuant to which Altria received certain governance rights which are summarized below.
Board Representation
The Investor Rights Agreement provides that, for so long as Altria and certain of its affiliates (the “Altria Group”) continue to beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares and the size of our board of directors (the “Board”) is seven directors, we agree to nominate for election as directors to the Board four individuals designated by Altria (the “Altria Nominees”). In addition, for so long as the Altria Group continues to beneficially own greater than 10% but less than 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria shall be entitled to nominate a number of Altria Nominees that represents its proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the Board (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time. At least one Altria Nominee must be independent as long as Atria has the right to designate at least three Altria Nominees and the Altria Group’s beneficial ownership of our issued and outstanding common shares does not exceed 50%.
The Investor Rights Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, for so long as Altria is entitled to designate one or more Altria Nominees, we agree to appoint to each committee established by the Board such number of Altria Nominees that represents Altria’s proportionate share of the number of directors comprising the applicable Board committee (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group at the relevant time. 
Approval Rights
The Investor Rights Agreement also grants Altria, until the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, approval rights over certain transactions that may be undertaken by us. We have agreed that, among other things, we will not (and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause our affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of Altria:

•engage in the production, cultivation, advertisement, marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of cannabis or any Related Products and Services (as defined herein) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., where such activity is prohibited by applicable law as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement (subject to certain limitations).
Exclusivity Covenant
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, until the earlier of:
(i)    the six-month anniversary of the date on which the Altria Group beneficially owns less than 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares; and
(ii)    the six-month anniversary of the termination of the Investor Rights Agreement,
Altria has agreed to make us its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities throughout the world (subject to certain limited exceptions).
Pre-Emptive Rights and Top-Up Rights
Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement and provided the Altria Group continues to beneficially own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has a right to purchase, directly or indirectly by another member of the Altria Group, upon the occurrence of certain issuances of common shares by us (including issuances of common shares to Ginkgo under the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement (each, a “Ginkgo Issuance”)) (each, a “Triggering Event”) and subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, up to such number of our common shares issuable in connection with the Triggering Event which will, when added to our common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group immediately prior to the Triggering Event, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to the Triggering Event (in each case, calculated on a non-diluted basis). The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of these pre-emptive rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the same price per common share at which the common shares are sold in the relevant Triggering Event; provided that if the consideration paid in connection with any such issuance is non-cash, the price per common share that would have been received had such common shares been issued for cash consideration will be determined by an independent committee (acting reasonably and in good faith); provided further that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its pre-emptive rights in connection with a Ginkgo Issuance will be C$16.25 per common share.
In addition to (and without duplication of) the aforementioned pre-emptive rights, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with top-up rights, exercisable on a quarterly basis, whereby, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals and for so long as the Altria Group beneficially owns at least 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Altria has the right to subscribe for such number of common shares in connection with any Top-Up Securities (as defined below) that we may, from time to time, issue after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement, as will, when added to the common shares beneficially owned by the Altria Group prior to such issuance, result in the Altria Group beneficially owning the same percentage of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Altria Group beneficially owned immediately prior to such issuance. “Top-Up Securities” means any of our common shares issued:
•on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued prior to the date of the Investor Rights Agreement or on the exercise, conversion or exchange of our convertible securities issued after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in compliance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, in each case, excluding any of our convertible securities owned by any member of the Altria Group;
•pursuant to any share incentive plan of the Company;
•on the exercise of any right granted by us pro rata to all shareholders to purchase additional common shares and/or other securities of the Company (other than a right issued in a rights offering in which Altria had the right to participate);
•in connection with bona fide bank debt, equipment financing or non-equity interim financing transactions with our lenders, in each case, with an equity component; or
•in connection with bona fide acquisitions (including acquisitions of assets or rights under a license or otherwise), mergers or similar business combination transactions or joint ventures undertaken and completed by us, 
in each case, other than (A) common shares issued pursuant to Altria’s pre-emptive right and (B) common shares issued pursuant to the Ginkgo Collaboration Agreement.
The price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights will be, subject to certain limited exceptions, the volume-weighted average price of our common shares on the TSX for the 10 full days preceding such exercise by Altria; provided that the price per common share to be paid by Altria pursuant to the exercise of its top-up rights in connection with the issuance of common shares pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants that were outstanding on the date of closing of the Altria Investment will be C$16.25 per common share without any set off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.
Standstill Covenant
For a period commencing on the date of the Investor Rights Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Altria Warrant has been exercised in full by Altria, and (ii) the expiry or termination of the Altria Warrant, the Investor Rights Agreement provides that, without the prior approval of an independent committee of the Board, no member of the Altria Group shall, directly or indirectly, acquire our common shares (other than upon settlement of any of our common shares issued, sold and delivered pursuant to the proper exercise of rights contemplated by the Altria Warrant Certificate or the exercise of pre-emptive rights or top-up rights). The Altria Group, however, may make a take-over bid or commence a tender offer, in each case, to acquire not less than all of our issued and outstanding common shares (other than any such common shares beneficially owned by any member of the Altria Group and its affiliates) in accordance with applicable law.
Registration Rights
The Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right, subject to certain limitations and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to require us to use reasonable commercial efforts to file a prospectus under applicable securities laws and/or a registration statement, qualifying our common shares held by Altria for distribution in Canada and/or the U.S. In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement provides Altria with the right to require us to include our common shares held by Altria in any proposed distribution of common shares in Canada and/or the U.S. by us for our own account.
Commercial Arrangements
In connection with the Altria Investment, we and Altria have entered into certain commercial arrangements (the “Commercial Arrangements”), pursuant to which Altria provides us with consulting services on matters which may include R&D, marketing, advertising and brand management, government relations and regulatory affairs, finance, tax planning, logistics and other corporate administrative matters. The services under the Commercial Arrangements are provided on customary terms and for a services fee payable by us that is equal to Altria’s reasonably allocated costs plus 5%.
Protection of Intangible Assets 
The ownership and protection of our intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of our future success. Currently, we rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. We protect our intellectual property by strategically seeking and obtaining registered protection where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into agreements with parties that have access to our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our inventions, germplasm, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
In addition, we have sought trademark protection in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, the U.S., China, Israel and Europe. Our ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada. For example, in the U.S., registered federal trademark protection is only available for goods and services that can be lawfully used in interstate commerce; the PTO is not currently approving any trademark applications for U.S. Schedule I cannabis, or certain goods containing U.S. hemp-derived CBD (such as dietary supplements and food) until the FDA provides clearer guidance on the regulation of such products. In Europe, trademarks cannot be obtained for products that are “contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality.” Accordingly, our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and enforce intellectual property rights against third-party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain jurisdictions.

We maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations, and provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related policies.
Regulatory Framework in the U.S.
U.S. Hemp Regulatory Framework 
We derive a portion of our revenues from the manufacture, marketing and distribution of U.S. hemp-derived supplement and cosmetic consumer products through e-commerce, retail and hospitality channels in certain states in the U.S. All U.S. hemp-derived products produced and sold by us constitute “hemp” (i) under the 2018 Farm Bill and (ii) the applicable state-law equivalent in all states in which we produce and sell such U.S. hemp-derived products. The 2018 Farm Bill was enacted in the U.S. on December 20, 2018. Prior to this enactment, cannabis was scheduled as a controlled substance (marijuana) under the CSA with limited exemptions based on the portion of the cannabis plant. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed U.S. hemp (which is defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”) and its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD, derived from hemp, from the definition of “marijuana” in the CSA, thereby removing U.S. hemp and its derivatives as controlled substances. The 2018 Farm Bill also amended the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for production and sale of U.S. hemp and its derivatives in the U.S.
The 2018 Farm Bill tasks the USDA with promulgating regulations in relation to the cultivation and production of U.S. hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill also directs the USDA to promulgate federal regulations that would apply to the production of U.S. hemp in every state that does not put forth a state U.S. hemp plan for approval by the USDA. In January 2021, the USDA issued a final rule governing U.S. hemp production in the U.S. with an effective date of March 22, 2021. There remains some possibility that the effective date of the final rule could be extended, but the USDA has not so indicated that it intends to extend the effective date of the final rule.
The USDA’s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating U.S. hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, U.S. hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits U.S. hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where U.S. hemp is produced, testing U.S. hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for U.S. hemp producers. The USDA’s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement.
States may adopt regulatory schemes that impose different levels of regulation and costs on the production of U.S. hemp. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill provides that its provisions do not pre-empt or limit state laws that regulate the production of U.S. hemp. Accordingly, some states may choose to restrict or prohibit some or all U.S. hemp production or sales within the state and variances in states’ laws and regulations on U.S. hemp are likely to persist.
Further, each state has discretion to develop and implement its own laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, marketing, labeling and sale of U.S. hemp products, which has created a patchwork of different regulatory schemes applicable to such products.
Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-regulated products (e.g., drugs, food, dietary supplements and cosmetics) containing U.S. hemp and U.S. hemp-derived ingredients, including CBD. Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the states may diverge from the federal treatment of the use of U.S. hemp as, or in, food, dietary supplements or cosmetic products.
The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD, whether derived from U.S. hemp or U.S. Schedule I cannabis, is prohibited from use as an ingredient in food and dietary supplements. This stems from its interpretation of the exclusionary clauses in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because CBD has been approved as a prescription drug and is the subject of substantial clinical investigations as a drug, which have been made public. The exclusionary clauses under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide that a substance that has been approved or has been subject to substantial clinical investigations as a drug may not be used in a food or dietary supplement, unless the substance was first marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to the initiation of substantial clinical investigations of the substance as a drug. The exclusionary clause does not apply to cosmetics. Cosmetics containing CBD could be viewed as drug products by the FDA if disease claims are made, or if the FDA determines the use of CBD in the product has a structure or function effect on the body (i.e., a drug effect).
The FDA has not issued regulations that elaborate on the exclusionary clauses and the FDA has not taken any enforcement action in the courts asserting a violation of the exclusionary clauses. To date, the FDA has issued a number of warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturers made unsubstantiated claims about the product being able to treat medical conditions (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal, anxiety and COVID-19) and had not obtained drug approvals. Others were issued to companies marketing CBD products as dietary supplements despite those products which contain CBD not meeting the definition of a dietary supplement, adding CBD to human and animal foods and marketing CBD products for infants and children and other vulnerable populations. Some of these letters were co-signed with the FTC and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD and other ingredients which were not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. In December 2020, the FTC announced it had entered into settlement agreements with six companies marketing CBD products including oils, gummies, creams, and others with deceptive health claims about serious health conditions. The settlements included monetary penalties ranging from $20,000 to $85,000. The FDA has also issued one warning letter to a dietary supplement manufacturer objecting to a CBD supplement on the basis that CBD was not a permissible dietary supplement ingredient.
In November 2019, the FDA published a revised “Consumer Update” on CBD. The update noted that, as at the time of the Consumer Update, the FDA has approved only one CBD product, a prescription drug product to treat two rare, severe forms of epilepsy. The update also stated that it is illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement, that the FDA has seen only limited data about CBD safety and these data point to real risks that need to be considered before taking CBD for any reason and that some CBD products are being marketed with unproven medical claims and are of unknown quality. Lastly, the FDA stated that it continues to evaluate the regulatory frameworks that apply to certain cannabis-derived products that are intended for non-drug uses, including whether and/or how they might consider updating their regulations, as well as whether potential legislation might be appropriate.
The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drug and other consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a dedicated internal working group to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA held a public hearing in May 2019 to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. The rules and regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. In July 2020, the FDA sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) for review a draft guidance, “Cannabidiol Enforcement Policy,” the details of which were not made public. This guidance remained under review at the OMB until January 2021, when it was withdrawn by the FDA as a part of the regulatory moratorium Executive Order issued by President Biden. The timeline for further CBD policy development remains uncertain while the new administration is put into place and as the FDA faces competing regulatory priorities. In December 2020, the FDA announced a framework for leveraging real world evidence to better understand CBD safety and a number of research projects the agency plans to develop to address gaps in current CBD research. At the same time, the FDA reiterated that CBD remains subject to the same safety standard as any other ingredient based on its intended use, and that there remain a number of safety issues that need to be addressed in order to support the safety of CBD as a food or dietary supplement ingredient. The FDA also announced an expansion of its market sampling and analytical testing of CBD products, as well as issued a new series of Warning Letters against companies marketing CBD products with serious disease claims, including products that the agency viewed as posing serious health risks based on their route of administration, including nasal, ophthalmic and inhalable products.

Regulatory Framework in Canada
Licenses and Regulatory Framework
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations (the “Cannabis Regulations”) came into force. The Cannabis Regulations establish six classes of licenses: 
•cultivation;
•processing;
•sale for medical purposes;
•analytical testing;
•research; and
•cannabis drug. 
The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing). Different licenses and each sub-class therein carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each category and sub-class.
Federal Regime
The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for, among other things, the cultivation, processing, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, possession and disposal of adult-use cannabis, implemented by regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations include, among other things, strict specifications for the plain packaging and labeling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed cultivation, processing and sales sites.
On October 17, 2019, the Regulations Amending the Cannabis Regulations (the “Further Regulations”) came into effect. The Further Regulations amend the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations to, among other things, permit the production and sale of cannabis extracts (including concentrates), cannabis topicals and cannabis edibles, in addition to dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants and cannabis seeds for parties holding the appropriate licenses. The Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products, including limiting the THC content and serving size of certain product forms.
Health Canada allows license holders to export cannabis and cannabis products with appropriate export permits. Export permits issued by Health Canada are specific to each shipment and may only be obtained for medical or scientific purposes. To apply for a permit to export cannabis, a license holder must submit significant information to the minister including information about the substance to be exported (including description, intended use, quantity) and the importer. As part of the application, applicants are also required to provide a copy of the import permit issued by a competent authority in the jurisdiction of final destination and to make a declaration to the minister that the shipment does not contravene the laws of the jurisdiction of the final destination or any country of transit or transshipment. 
The Cannabis Act requires the federal government to conduct a review of the Cannabis Act beginning in October 2021. This statutory review is required to include, among other things, consideration of (i) the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act, (ii) the impact of the Cannabis Act on public health, (iii) the health and consumption habits of young persons, (iv) the impact of cannabis on indigenous persons and communities and (v) the impact of the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house. This statutory review may lead to the amendment, removal or addition of provisions in or to the Cannabis Act which could adversely affect our business.
In addition to the current medical and adult-use regimes under the Cannabis Act, Health Canada has also been considering the implementation of a cannabis health product regime for products with potential therapeutic uses that would not require practitioner oversight. Between June and September 2019, Health Canada held a public consultation titled “Potential Market for Cannabis Health Products (CHPs) that would not Require Practitioner Oversight”. The consultation sought feedback from Canadians on the kinds of cannabis health products they would be interested in if such products were made available in Canada. A summary report of the consultation results was published by Health Canada in September 2020. Given the results of the consultation, Health Canada has indicated that it intends to obtain external scientific advice on the appropriate evidence standards required to demonstrate safety, efficacy and quality in cannabis health products, with the information it gathers informing the next steps on a potential implementation of a cannabis health product regime.
Provincial and Territorial Developments 
While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Canadian federal government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, the various provinces and territories of Canada regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution, sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.
The governments of each Canadian province and territory have implemented their regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes which continue to evolve over time. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age for possession and consumption of 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively. In addition, provinces and territories may impose restrictions on sales, distribution and promotion which are more stringent than those at the federal level. For example, the SQDC, the exclusive distributor of cannabis in the province and the sole retail and online vendor in Québec, does not permit cannabis vaporizers or other high THC non-edible cannabis products to be sold through its channels. The SQDC has also placed significant restrictions on the types of edibles that may be sold through its channels, prohibiting edibles that are sweet, confectionary, dessert, chocolate or any other product attractive to persons under 21 years of age. Similarly, the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador also do not allow cannabis vaporizers to be sold through their channels.
Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Israel
In Israel, cannabis is subject to the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 - 1973, and its sale and use are prohibited unless applicable licenses have been obtained. Licenses to cultivate, possess and use cannabis for medical or research purposes in Israel are granted by the Israel Medical Cannabis Agency within the Israeli Ministry of Health (the “Yakar” and the “Israeli MOH”, respectively). Patients also must obtain licenses either directly from physicians who have been authorized to grant patient licenses or from the Yakar following a request from the patient’s physician in order to purchase and consume medical cannabis. 
In January 2019, the Israeli government approved, in principle, the export from Israel of medical cannabis products that meet applicable quality standards under the strict supervision of the Israeli authorities. Only products that can be directly marketed to patients (including smoking products, oils, and vaporizer products) may be exported, and only to those countries that have signed the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and that have explicitly approved the import of cannabis. The export of plant substances, including seeds and tissue cultures, is not permitted. In October 2020, the Israeli MOH initiated a pilot program in which certain medical cannabis companies were permitted to export their products, and the Yakar issued guidelines relating to the export of medical cannabis products. These guidelines set forth the process and conditions for obtaining an export license, which can only be issued to an applicant already holding a valid Yakar license.
Cronos Israel Licenses 
During the first quarter of 2020, the Yakar granted Cronos Israel: (1) full Good Agricultural Practices (“GAP”) certification, including a permit to cultivate at the full capacity of the greenhouse; and (2) GMP and Good Distribution Practices (“GDP”) certificates and permits to produce and distribute dried flower. During the third quarter of 2020, Cronos Israel also received GMP and GDP certificates and permits to produce and distribute cannabis oils and pre-rolls.
Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Other Jurisdictions
We and our joint venture partners and strategic investments are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulations in each jurisdiction we and they operate. All aspects of the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis products are regulated and subject to licensing regimes. These regulations and licensing regimes vary by jurisdiction and we, our joint venture partners and strategic investments spend significant time, effort and money to comply with the applicable requirements.
