 Recent Developments
 Axar Letter
 On September 27, 2021, the Company announced that it had received a letter (the “Letter”) dated September 22, 2021 from Axar Capital Management, LP (“Axar”) in which Axar expressed an interest in pursuing discussions concerning strategic alternatives that may be beneficial to the Company and its various stakeholders. Axar has engaged Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP as its legal advisor and stated in the Letter that it would engage a financial advisor at the appropriate time. According to the Letter, Axar expected that any such discussions would be conducted with a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), assisted by financial and legal advisors engaged by such committee. The Letter also stated that any transaction involving Axar arising from such discussions would be conditioned upon, among other things, approval of the special committee and the Board, the negotiation and execution of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements and customary terms. The Letter also stated that any transaction structured as a take-private transaction would be subject to a closing condition that the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares not owned by Axar or its affiliates be obtained. On September 26, 2021, the Board authorized its Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of independent directors Stephen J. Negrotti, Kevin Patrick and Patricia Wellenbach, to engage in the discussions contemplated by the Letter, including the authority to engage in discussions concerning and to negotiate the terms and provisions of any strategic alternative the Conflicts Committee determines to be appropriate in connection with such discussions. Under its charter, the Conflicts Committee has the authority to reject, approve or recommend that the Board approve any transaction that is a related party transaction, which would include any transaction to which Axar is a party. The Conflicts Committee has retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist in such discussions. Following receipt of the Letter and until recently, the Conflicts Committee and its counsel had engaged in discussions with Axar and Axar’s counsel, which evolved to focus on a potential offer by Axar to acquire the shares of the Company that are not owned by Axar or its affiliates. While these negotiations had been productive, the Conflicts Committee and Axar had not come to agreement on any price that Axar would pay for such shares or on certain other terms of any transaction, and there can be no assurance that any agreement would be reached in the future. Negotiations between the Conflicts Committee and Axar were recently tabled in light of the work undertaken by the Conflicts Committee with respect to the independent review of certain investments by our trusts in which Axar had an interest. See Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
 The Conflicts Committee may at any time determine to resume such negotiations, but there can be no assurance that even if such negotiations are resumed, any agreement with respect to a take-private transaction will be executed or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated. The Company does not undertake any obligation to provide any updates with respect to these matters except as required under applicable law.
 Refinancing
 On May 11, 2021, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The gross proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Notes was $389.9 million, less advisor fees, legal fees, mortgage costs and other closing expenses. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “2029 Indenture”), dated as of May 11, 2021, by and among the Company, the guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the 2029 Notes, StoneMor Partners L.P. (the “Partnership”) and Cornerstone Family Services of West Virginia Subsidiary, Inc. (collectively, the “2024 Issuers”) deposited

from the net cash proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes an amount sufficient to fund the full redemption of the outstanding 9.875%/11.500% Senior Secured PIK Toggle Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) with Wilmington Trust, National Association (the “2024 Trustee”) as trustee under the Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2019 (as amended, the “2024 Indenture”), among the 2024 Issuers, the guarantors party thereto and the 2024 Trustee governing the 2024 Notes. Upon deposit of such funds with the 2024 Trustee, the 2024 Indenture was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms. As a result of the satisfaction and discharge of the 2024 Indenture, the 2024 Issuers and the guarantors of the 2024 Notes, including the Company, have been released from their obligations with respect to the 2024 Indenture and the 2024 Notes, except with respect to those provisions of the 2024 Indenture that, by their terms, survive the satisfaction and discharge of the 2024 Indenture. Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread worldwide posing public health risks that reached pandemic proportions (including the effect of variants that have developed, the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a significant threat to the health and economic wellbeing of the Company’s employees, customers and vendors. The Company’s operations are deemed essential by the state and local governments in which it operates, with the exception of Puerto Rico, and the Company has been working with federal, state and local government officials to ensure that it continues to satisfy their requirements for offering the Company’s essential services.
The Company’s top priority is the health and safety of its employees and the families it serves. Since the start of the outbreak in the U.S., the Company’s senior management team has taken actions to protect its employees and the families it serves, and to support its field locations as they adapt and adjust to the circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. The operation of all of the Company’s facilities is critically dependent on the employees who staff these locations. To ensure the wellbeing of the Company’s employees and their families, the Company provided all of its employees with detailed health and safety literature on COVID-19, such as the industry-specific guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) for working with the deceased who were or may have been infected with COVID-19. In addition, the Company’s procurement and safety teams have consistently secured and distributed supplies to ensure that the Company’s locations have appropriate personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and cleaning supplies to provide its essential services, as well as updated and developed new safety-oriented guidelines to support daily field operations. These guidelines include reducing the number of staff present for a service and restricting the number of attendees. The Company also implemented additional safety and precautionary measures as it concerns the businesses’ day-to-day interaction with the families and communities it serves. The Company’s corporate office employees began working from home in March 2020 consistent with CDC guidance to reduce the risks of exposure to COVID-19 while still supporting the field operations. The Company did not experience any significant disruptions to its business as a result of the work from home policies in its corporate office and employees have returned on a hybrid basis. The Company monitors the CDC guidance on a regular basis, continually reviews and updates its processes and procedures and provides updates to its employees as needed to comply with regulatory guidelines.
 The Company’s marketing and sales team quickly responded to the sales challenges presented by the COVID-19 Pandemic by implementing virtual meeting options using a variety of web-based tools to ensure that the Company can continue to connect with and meet its customers’ needs in a safe, effective and productive manner. Some of the Company’s locations provide live video streaming of their funeral and burial services to its customers or provide other alternatives that respect social distancing, so that family and friends can connect during their time of grief.
Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially. At the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic in early 2020, the Company saw its pre-need sales and at-need sales activity decline as Americans practiced social distancing and crowd size restrictions were put in place. However, since May 2020, the Company experienced at-need sales growth, and since late 2020, it has experienced pre-need sales growth. The Company believes the implementation of its virtual meeting tools early on in the COVID-19 Pandemic was one of several key steps that had mitigated this disruption. Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Company’s cemeteries and funeral homes have largely remained open and available to serve its families in all the locations in which it operates to the extent permitted by local authorities and the Company expects that this will continue. The Company has leveraged the relationships it has made with the families it has served during its response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, which has directly resulted in new sales leads and the increase in pre-need sales activity. In addition, as community restrictions have eased and the COVID-19 vaccine became more widely available, the Company has experienced growth in its pre-need cemetery sales, see “Results of Operations” of Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Company expects the COVID-19 Pandemic could have an adverse effect on its future results of operations and cash flows depending on COVID-19 variants and case counts. However, the Company cannot presently predict the likely scope and severity of that impact. In the event there are confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 within a significant number of its facilities, the Company may incur additional costs related to the closing and subsequent cleaning of these facilities and the ability to adequately staff the impacted sites. In addition, the Company’s pre-need customers with installment contracts could default on their installment contracts due to lost work or other financial stresses arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Alternatively, in the event that COVID-19 case counts continue to normalize and variants become less severe, we would expect to see a reduction in the demand for at-need products and services as well as a reduction in pre-need turning to at-need. 
Acquisitions
 On January 31, 2022, the Company acquired two cemeteries in Virginia for cash consideration of $5.1 million, pursuant to a definitive agreement signed on March 23, 2021 with Daly Seven, Inc. to acquire four cemeteries for a total purchase price of $5.4 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The remaining two cemeteries, which are located in North Carolina, are expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.
 On March 1, 2022, the Company acquired one funeral home in Florida for a cash purchase price of $1.7 million and on March 15, 2022, the Company acquired one combination cemetery and funeral home, a separate cemetery and a separate funeral home in West Virginia for a cash purchase price of $11.3 million, in each case subject to customary working capital adjustments.
Products and Service Offerings
 We are currently one of the largest owners and operators of cemeteries and funeral homes in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 300 cemeteries in 24 states and Puerto Rico. We own 271 of these cemeteries and we manage or operate the remaining 29 under lease, management or operating agreements with the nonprofit cemetery companies that own the cemeteries. As of December 31, 2021, we also owned, operated or managed 69 funeral homes, including 33 located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own, in 15 states and Puerto Rico.
 The cemetery products and services that we sell include the following:
 
Interment Rights | Merchandise | Services 
burial lots | burial vaults | installation of burial vaults 
lawn crypts | caskets | installation of caskets 
mausoleum crypts | grave markers and grave marker bases | installation of other cemetery merchandise

 We sell these products and services both at the time of death, which we refer to as at-need, and prior to the time of death, which we refer to as pre-need. In 2021, we performed 54,205 burials and sold 21,739 interment spaces (net of cancellations), excluding divested locations. Based on our sales of interment spaces in 2021, our cemeteries have an aggregate average remaining sales life of 282 years.
 Our cemetery properties are located in Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Our cemetery operations accounted for approximately 86% and 85% of our revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 The funeral home products and services that we sell include the following:
 
Merchandise | Services 
caskets and related items | family consultation

Our funeral homes are located in Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Our funeral home operations accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

OPERATIONS
 Segment Reporting and Related Information
 We have two distinct reportable segments, which are classified as Cemetery Operations and Funeral Home Operations segments, both of which are supported by corporate costs and expenses.
 We have chosen this level of organization and disaggregation of reportable segments because: (a) each reportable segment has unique characteristics that set it apart from the other segment; (b) we have organized our management personnel at these two operational levels; and (c) it is the level at which our chief decision makers evaluates performance.
 Cemetery Operations
 As of December 31, 2021, we operated 300 cemeteries. Our Cemetery Operations include sales of cemetery interment rights, merchandise and services and the performance of cemetery maintenance and other services. An interment right entitles a customer to a burial space in one of our cemeteries and the perpetual care of that burial space. Burial spaces, or lots, are parcels of property that hold interred human remains. A burial vault is a rectangular container, usually made of concrete but can also be made of steel or plastic, which sits in the burial lot and in which the casket is placed. The top of the burial vault is buried approximately 18 to 24 inches below the surface of the ground, and the casket is placed inside the vault. Burial vaults prevent ground settling that may create uneven ground surfaces. Ground settling typically results in higher maintenance costs and potential exposure for accidents on the property. Lawn crypts are a series of closely spaced burial lots with preinstalled vaults and may include other improvements, such as landscaping, sprinkler systems and drainage. A mausoleum crypt is an above ground structure that may be designed for a particular customer, which we refer to as a private mausoleum or it may be a larger building that serves multiple customers, which we refer to as a community mausoleum. Cremation niches are spaces in which the ashes remaining after cremation are stored. Cremation niches are often part of community mausoleums; although we sell a variety of cremation niches to accommodate our customers’ preferences.
 Grave markers, monuments and memorials are above ground products that serve as memorials by showing who is remembered, the dates of birth and death and other pertinent information. These markers, monuments and memorials include simple plates, such as those used in a community mausoleum or cremation niche, flush-to-the-ground granite or bronze markers, headstones or large stone obelisks.
 One of the principal services we provide at our cemeteries is an "opening and closing," which is the digging and refilling of burial spaces to install the vault and place the casket into the vault. With pre-need sales, there are usually two openings and closings, where permitted by applicable law. During the initial opening and closing, we install the burial vault in the burial space. Where permitted by applicable law, we usually perform this service shortly after the customer signs a pre-need contract. Advance installation allows us to withdraw the related funds from our merchandise trusts, making the amount in excess of our cost to purchase and install the vault available to us for other uses and eliminates future merchandise trusting requirements for the burial vault and its installation. During the final opening and closing, we remove the dirt above the vault, open the lid of the vault, place the casket into the vault, close the vault lid and replace the ground cover. With at-need sales, we typically perform the initial opening and closing at the time we perform the final opening and closing. Our other services include the installation of other cemetery merchandise and the perpetual care related to interment rights.
 Funeral Home Operations
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned, operated or managed 69 funeral homes, 33 of which are located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own. Our funeral homes offer a range of services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including family consultation, final expense insurance products, the removal and preparation of remains, provision of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation, worship and performance of funeral services and transportation services. Funeral Home Operations primarily generate revenues from at-need sales.
Cremation Products and Services
 We operate crematories at some of our cemeteries or funeral homes, but our primary crematory operations are sales of receptacles for cremated remains, such as urns, and the inurnment of cremated remains in niches or scattering gardens. Cremation products and services usually cost less than traditional burial products and services and take up less space than burials. We sell cremation products and services on both a pre-need and an at-need basis.
Seasonality
 Although the death care business is relatively stable and predictable, our results of operations may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in deaths due to weather conditions, illness and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic. Generally, more deaths occur during the winter months, primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza. In addition, we generally perform fewer initial openings and closings in the winter, as the ground is frozen in many of the areas in which we operate. We may also experience declines in contracts written during the winter months due to increased inclement weather during which our sales staff would be unable to meet with customers.
Sales Contracts
 Pre-need products and services are typically sold on an installment basis. At-need products and services are generally required to be paid for in full in cash by the customer at the time of sale. As a result of our pre-need sales, the backlog of unfulfilled pre-need performance obligations recorded in deferred revenues was $1,056.3 million and $949.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding amounts classified as held for sale.
Trusts
 Sales of cemetery products and services are subject to a variety of state regulations. In accordance with these regulations, we are required to establish and fund two types of trusts: merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts, to ensure that we can meet our future obligations. Our funding obligations are generally equal to a percentage of the sales proceeds or costs of the products and services we sell.
 Human Capital
We recognize that our success depends upon the services and capabilities of all of our people. It is built upon our dedicated, passionate and diverse employees who work and live in the communities we serve. Our goal is to provide a working environment that is welcoming and inclusive, offers competitive pay and benefits, supports the growth and development of our employees and affirms our corporate values and mission. We are committed to ensuring equal employment opportunity and that all of our employment decisions, policies and practices are in accordance with applicable federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws. Our Human Resources team, with oversight from our Board of Directors and its committees, develops and executes programs for compensation and benefits, onboarding and training and performance management.
 All full-time employees are eligible for competitive health and welfare benefits, including medical, dental, vision, disability, life insurance and other benefits. Full-time employees in the U.S. can participate in our defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides for a matching contribution of 25 percent of the first three percent of an employee’s contribution. The Company also has a similar type plan for its Puerto Rico employees.
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,831 full-time, 146 part-time and 4 temporary employees. 46 of these full-time employees are represented by unions in Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and are subject to collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging up to September 2024. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally favorable. The average tenure of our employees is 5.5 years.
Our current CEO has been in place since July 2018 and our current CFO has been in place since September 2019, following several years of frequent changes in these positions. Our compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain high quality executive officers who will advance our overall business strategies and goals to create and return value to our stockholders. Our compensation programs include short-term elements, such as annual base salaries and cash bonuses, as well as longer term elements such as equity-based awards. We have designed our compensation programs to align the interests of our management and our stockholders.
 Our ability to attract and retain a qualified sales force and other personnel is an important factor in achieving success. Buying cemetery and funeral home products and services, especially at-need products and services, is very emotional for most customers, so our sales force must be particularly sensitive to our customers’ needs.
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed 373 full-time commissioned salespeople, 48 sales trainees, two part-time commissioned salespeople, 77 salaried sales managers, 15 commission-only sales managers, 37 outside sales counselors and four full-time sales support employees. We had two divisional vice presidents and two divisional vice presidents of operations who report directly to our two divisional presidents. Individual salespersons are typically located at the cemeteries they serve and report directly to the

cemetery sales manager. Our compensation programs for sales staff are comprised of various plans designed to motivate through a variety of compensation components including base wages, commissions, bonuses and overrides. Performance is evaluated according to location budget or individual quotas.
 We have made a commitment to the ongoing education and training of our sales force and to salesperson retention in order to provide our customers high quality customer service and in an effort to comply with all applicable laws and requirements. Our salespeople are trained to prioritize our customers’ needs and sell merchandise and services that are in our customers’ best interests. Our training program includes classroom training at regional training locations, field training, web-based modules and participation in industry seminars. Additionally, we place special emphasis on training property sales managers, who are key elements to a successful pre-need sales program.
 Marketing
 We generate sales leads through various methods including digital marketing, direct mail, websites, funeral follow-up and sales force cold calling, with the assistance of database mining and other marketing resources. Our marketing department provides sophisticated marketing techniques to focus more effectively on our lead generation and to direct sales efforts. Sales leads are referred to the sales force to schedule an appointment, either at the customer’s home or at the cemetery location. In addition, our marketing and sales team quickly responded to the sales challenges presented by the COVID-19 Pandemic by implementing virtual meeting options using a variety of web-based tools to ensure that we can continue to connect with and meet our customers’ needs in a safe, effective and productive manner. Some of our locations are providing live video streaming of their funeral and burial services to customers or providing other alternatives that respect social distancing, so that family and friends can connect during their time of grief.
Competition
 Our cemeteries and funeral homes generally serve customers that live within a 10 to 15-mile radius of a property’s location. We face competition from other cemeteries and funeral homes located within this localized area. Most of these cemeteries and funeral homes are independently owned and operated, and most of these owners and operators are smaller than we are and have fewer resources than we do. We have historically faced limited competition from the two larger publicly held death care companies that have U.S. operations — Service Corporation International and Carriage Services, Inc. — as they do not directly operate cemeteries in the same local geographic areas in which we operate. Furthermore, these companies have historically generated the majority of their revenues from funeral home operations. Based on the relative levels of cemetery and funeral home operations of these publicly traded death care companies, which are disclosed in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we believe that we are the only publicly held death care company that focuses a majority of its efforts on Cemetery Operations.
 Within a localized area of competition, we compete primarily for at-need sales because, in general, many of the independently owned, local competitors may not have pre-need sales programs. The number of customers that cemeteries and funeral homes are able to attract is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important factors. The sale of cemetery and funeral home products and services on a pre-need basis has increasingly been used by many companies as an important marketing tool. Due to the importance of reputation and heritage, increases in customer base are usually gained over a long period of time.
 Competitors within a localized area have an advantage over us if a potential customer’s family members are already buried in the competitor’s cemetery. If either of the two publicly held death care companies identified above operated, or in the future were to operate, cemeteries within close proximity of our cemeteries, they may offer more competition than independent cemeteries and may have a competitive advantage over us to the extent they have greater financial resources available to them due to their size and access to the capital markets.
 REGULATION
 Our funeral operations are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the “Funeral Rule.” The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral merchandise and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral merchandise or services as a condition for furnishing other

funeral merchandise or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral merchandise and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items. Our operations are also subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those that impose trusting requirements
 Our operations are subject to federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental protection, such as the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response (“EPCRA”), Compensation, and Liability Act, that impose legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges.
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. OSHA’s regulatory requirement, known as the Hazard Communication Standard, and similar state statutes require us to provide information and training to our employees about hazardous materials used or maintained for our operations. We may also be subject to Tier 1 or Tier 2 Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory reporting requirements under the EPCRA, depending on the amount of hazardous materials maintained on-site at a particular facility. We are also subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws, which, among other things, may require that we modify our facilities to comply with minimum accessibility requirements for disabled persons.
 We take various measures to comply with the Funeral Rule and all other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and we believe we are substantially in compliance with these existing laws and regulations.
 Federal, state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the deathcare industry in general. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us.
