Our Strategy
The Company is focused on investing in high value solutions to diversify its revenue and increase exposure to high-growth markets. 
In our Audio segment, our primary focus is to position the Company to benefit from the positive trends across consumer devices. With products ranging from mobile phones to headsets, and from smart speakers to household appliances, improved audio quality and voice-powered interactions have emerged as critical and necessary features. Across mobile, ear, and IoT markets, consumers want better audio performance and to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands, and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs") are developing and deploying the technology to enable it. Our unique capabilities in MEMS microphones, balanced armature speakers, and digital signal processing place us in a competitive position to enhance audio performance and enable voice input.
Our focus on strategically positioning the business to support favorable trends in audio includes significant investments in MEMS microphones and balanced armature speakers to maintain our leadership positions and optimize our manufacturing footprint across our business units. We also divested our low-margin speaker and receiver product line for handsets ("Speaker and Receiver Product Line") in 2016 to focus on higher-value solutions for end markets exhibiting greater unit growth.
In our Precision Devices segment, we continue to focus on sales growth and improved operating margins through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. In 2017, we reshaped our portfolio by divesting our timing device business ("Timing Device Business") to increase our focus on growth platforms in Precision Devices where we have strong market positions and attractive margin profiles, including telecom, medtech, defense, electric vehicle, and industrial applications.

In our Audio segment, voice has been embraced as a primary user interface across consumer electronic devices. Voice assistants are proliferating throughout a variety of applications from mobile phones to headsets, and from smart speakers to household appliances. Across mobile, ear, and IoT markets, consumers want to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands, and OEMs are developing and deploying the technology to enable it. Our unique capabilities in MEMS microphones, balanced armature speakers, and digital signal processing place us in a competitive position to enhance audio performance and enable voice input. 
Within the hearing aid market, sales are largely driven by aging demographics, healthcare spending, increasing affluence in emerging markets, and government subsidies.
Our Precision Devices segment sells high reliability, high voltage and high temperature ceramic capacitors, and electromagnetic interference filters across diverse end markets, including telecom, defense, medtech, and industrial markets. Portions of this segment face much greater exposure to capital investment cycles and government spending, both direct and indirect, as some of these end markets are largely dependent on project upgrades, expansion, and government contracts.
Geographic Trends
We strive to maintain our manufacturing facilities in close proximity to our direct customers. In Audio, we currently operate 4 facilities in Asia to serve the contract manufacturers who build OEM equipment on behalf of our end-customers. These contract manufacturers are largely based in China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Although end-user demand for consumer electronics and hearing aids is global and marketing activities occur globally, the majority of our manufacturing is located in Asia, primarily in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
In PD, we operate 5 facilities in North America and 1 facility in Asia for the manufacturing of capacitors that support our global customers, as well as their suppliers and contract manufacturers.
Competitive Landscape
Success in the electronic components industry is primarily driven by innovation and flexibility as customers compete to gain a share of the growing consumer device market. We compete across consumer platforms to deliver superior acoustic performance through customized products. Our investments in research and development enable us to capture new design wins across consumer OEMs. Our ability to balance and shift between full and semi-automation is key to our ability to optimize our operations and operating expenses. Additionally, it is important for suppliers to have flexibility and quick time-to-market to meet clients’ needs. Key competitors include:
•Audio - AAC Technologies, Goertek, Infineon, and Sonion; and
•PD - Kyocera Corporation, Yageo Corporation, and Murata.
In the Audio segment, our investments in research and development enable us to continually introduce new products with better features and performance. Our customers are adopting these higher value microphones to improve the overall audio performance of their devices which in turn improves the end user experience. Typically our new products have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing. Once introduced, the pricing for these products trend lower, as is typical in the consumer electronics market.
For products that were introduced more than 18 months ago, we strive to offset anticipated price erosion through bill of material cost reductions, yield improvements, equipment efficiency, and movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations.
In the PD segment, the end markets tend to have less pricing pressure. We see a fragmented set of competitors across high end capacitors for a diverse set of end markets including telecom, defense, medtech, and industrial.
Customers, Sales, and Distribution
We serve customers in the mobile consumer electronics, industrial, defense, electric vehicle, medtech, and telecommunications markets. Our customers include some of the largest OEMs and operators in these markets. In addition, many of our OEM customers outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies. Other customers include global mobile phone manufacturers, hearing aid manufacturers, and many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China.

For further detail and for additional disclosures regarding sales and long-lived assets by geographic location, see Note 18. Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals, and semi-processed or finished components. Commodity pricing for various metals, such as palladium, gold, brass, stainless steel, and copper, fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs.
We rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components, or subassemblies that are used in our products which, in some cases, may be sole sourced from such suppliers or foundries or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. The loss of any single supplier has not had a material impact on operating profits. However, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Research and Development
We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain other emerging product and technology opportunities. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into our customers’ products at competitive prices. Our future success may also depend on increasing acoustic content in our customers’ products including assisting our customers with integration of our products and software into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch, and production ramp.
Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2021 through 2039. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2021, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development. We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for KNOWLES and Knowles logo designs, along with various other trademarks. These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce. We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business. To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Seasonality
In general, our businesses tend to have higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles and the timing of new OEM product launches can impact quarterly revenues, earnings, and cash flow.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, Knowles had approximately 7,000 employees at facilities located in 13 countries around the world. Approximately 84% of our employees are located in Asia and approximately 70% of our employees identify as female. We believe our success is dependent upon attracting, developing, and retaining high performing employees at all levels of the organization. An important component of achieving this goal is fostering a workplace environment that embraces diversity and inclusion. Our Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for developing and executing on our human capital strategy, with oversight by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Key initiatives of the Company with respect to human capital management include:
Recruitment, Training, and Development
We utilize a variety of recruitment vehicles to source top talent, including strategic partnerships with search firms, leveraging social media channels, strategic partnerships with universities and industry organizations, and a robust employee referral program. We invest in the ongoing training and development of our employees by offering tuition and continuous education reimbursement, leveraging an e-learning platform, and implementing formal mentorship programs. Our Chief Human Resources Officer annually reviews with the Board of Directors our overall talent management strategy and progress.
Commitment To Diversity, Inclusion, and Equality
We believe our diverse teams, with their unique ideas, thoughts, and perspectives, form the building blocks for our culture of innovation at Knowles. We strive to create and maintain a workplace environment that embraces the diversity of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and experiences, brought by our team members. We recognize that nurturing an inclusive workplace enables us to attract, develop, and retain our team members regardless of their race, color, gender identity, language, national origin, religion, orientation, or age. As part of our diversity and inclusion strategy, during fiscal year 2020, we launched implicit bias training for our U.S. employees and created a Diversity and Inclusion Council. The Diversity and Inclusion Council is comprised of employees from various areas of the Company along with members of senior management who serve as executive sponsors. The Council is tasked with advising the management team on concrete initiatives we can undertake as an organization to strengthen diversity and inclusion at the Company.
Knowles is also committed to the advancement of women in the workplace and gender diversity in engineering careers. We endeavor to be known as an Employer of Choice for Women in Engineering and have implemented programs with the goal of increasing the representation of women in the engineering community. For example, we have partnered with the University of Illinois at Chicago ("UIC") as a sponsor of their Women in Engineering Summer Program. We have also supported UIC's women engineering students with programs such as academic scholarships, summer internship programs, mentorship programs, and full-time employment opportunities. Our goal is to build a pipeline of multi-generational talent and accelerate the development of women engineers into advanced technical and leadership positions at Knowles. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the representation of women in leadership roles at Knowles.
Providing a Competitive Total Rewards Program
To be able to attract and retain the best employees, Knowles provides a competitive total rewards program that incorporates our pay for performance philosophy. Our total rewards program includes market-competitive base pay, broad-based short-term and long-term incentive plans, healthcare benefits, retirement plans, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.
Fostering a Safe Work Environment
We believe it is important to provide a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We maintain an Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy that reflects our goals to not only reduce our carbon footprint, but to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of our employees. We provide environmental, health, and safety training and instruction at all levels within the Company. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted enhanced safety measures and practices across all of our facilities, including adopting social distancing measures (such as limiting or reducing the number of workers at our sites), enacting enhanced cleaning measures, and providing workers with personal protection equipment.
