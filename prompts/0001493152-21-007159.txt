Item 1. Business
Overview
 
PolarityTE, Inc., headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a biotechnology company developing regenerative tissue products and biomaterials. We also operate a laboratory testing and clinical research business using equipment, personnel, and facilities we acquired to advance our development of regenerative tissue products.
Regenerative Tissue Product
 
Our first regenerative tissue product is SkinTE, which is intended for the repair, reconstruction, replacement, and supplementation of skin in patients who have a need for treatment of acute or chronic wounds, burns, surgical reconstruction events, scar revision, or removal of dysfunctional skin grafts. SkinTE was registered and listed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in August 2017 based on our determination that SkinTE is appropriately regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., as a so-called 361 HCT/P) and that, as a result, no premarket review or approval by the FDA was required. We proceeded to develop sales and manufacturing capabilities for SkinTE and focused on advancing commercialization of SkinTE. We began a regional commercial rollout of SkinTE in October 2018.
 
Following informal, voluntary discussions between us and the FDA we were advised by the FDA in April 2020 that its preliminary assessment is that SkinTE does not meet the requirements to be regulated solely as a 361 HCT/P. Rather, the FDA’s preliminary assessment was that SkinTE is a biological product that should be regulated under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. We re-evaluated our regulatory approach and determined it is prudent to submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for SkinTE and an eventual biologics license application (“BLA”) because we believe it will create a more valuable asset with a greater likelihood of achieving widespread commercial adoption, and to avoid the possibility of a protracted dispute with the FDA. As a result of the change in the regulatory approach for SkinTE, we decided to adjust our SkinTE commercial operations accordingly.
 
The FDA developed and published in November 2017 a regenerative medicine policy framework to help facilitate regenerative medicine therapies. Under the framework, the FDA stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion until November 2020 with respect to the FDA’s IND and premarket approval requirements, which was subsequently extended through May 2021. We continued to sell SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P in 2020 and into 2021 in reliance on our view that there is a reasonable basis for regulating SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P and also in reliance on the enforcement discretion position stated in the policy framework. In May 2020, we effectuated a reduction in force within our regenerative medicine business segment to reduce historical monthly cash burn and preserve capital for pursuing the filing of an IND. Since then we have focused our commercial effort for SkinTE on the territories where we have current and repeat users of SkinTE.
 
We have evaluated the question of whether the FDA may extend enforcement discretion on regenerative medical products, and as of the date of this report the FDA has not taken any action on extending enforcement discretion. Following the end of the FDA’s period of enforcement discretion, we may need to cease selling SkinTE until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market the product for indications that have been approved in a BLA. We cannot predict at this time when we may decide on continuing SkinTE sales because of the uncertainty around the decisions the FDA may make in this area.
 
We plan to focus our SkinTE activity on the preparation and submission of an IND in the second half of 2021, and the commencement of clinical trials under that IND once it is open. We believe that the network of physicians and other healthcare providers who have treated more than 1,100 patients to date with SkinTE will provide valuable support for our clinical development program as we work towards a BLA for SkinTE.

Testing and Research Services
 
Beginning in 2017 we developed internally a laboratory and research capability to advance the development of SkinTE and related technologies, which we operate through our subsidiary, Arches Research, Inc. (“Arches”). At the beginning of May 2018, we acquired a preclinical research and veterinary sciences business to be used, in part, for preclinical studies on our regenerative tissue products, which we operate through our subsidiary IBEX Preclinical Research, Inc. (“IBEX”). Through Arches and IBEX, we also offer research and laboratory testing services to unrelated third parties on a contract basis.
 
There was a substantial surge in COVID-19 testing throughout the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the spring of 2020. In the course of its operations, Arches maintains equipment and staff capable of performing molecular polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19, which made it possible for Arches to begin providing COVID-19 testing services at the end of May 2020. We believe that COVID-19 testing offers an opportunity to use existing resources to generate additional revenue in the contract services segment and thereby help defray our operating expenses. We provided COVID-19 testing services through the end of 2020, which we expect will continue in 2021.
 
SkinTE
 
The Importance of Skin
 
Skin has several functions. It provides a barrier to water loss and pathogens, and protects against diverse forms of trauma, including thermal, chemical, and ultraviolet radiation. Skin keeps us in touch with our environment through a host of nerve endings, regulates body temperature, and enhances metabolic functions. Skin is an active immune organ functioning as a first line of defence against a wide spectrum of common pathogens encountered on a regular basis. Biosynthesis of melanin in the skin reduces the harmful effects of ultraviolet light. Skin is a ready source of vitamin D, which plays an important role in maintaining healthy levels of serum calcium and resorption of bone.
 
The clinical significance of skin is illustrated by the morbidity associated with chronic wounds, burns, and cutaneous defects. A 12-month prospective observational study of diabetic foot ulcers first published in Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association in 2018 reported that out of a group of 299 patients, 17.4% had some sort of amputation of the foot and 6.0% of the 299 patients underwent revascularization surgery. A report published on Medscape in June 2018 states that pressure injuries are listed as the direct cause of death in 7-8% of all patients with paraplegia. And according to statistics collected by the National Burn Repository, the mortality rate from 2008 to 2017 among burn patients treated at surveyed burn centers is approximately 3%. We believe that the regeneration of full-thickness skin with all the processes and appendages that enable it to perform its vital functions is critical to long-term, positive patient outcomes following serious skin injury.
 
Limitations of Other Skin Treatment Therapies
 
Current clinical standards and practice adhere to the concept that skin should be replaced with skin whenever possible in settings where patients have suffered the loss of such tissue. Understanding this, medical professionals are left with a decision to attempt to temporize a wound bed with an autograft (using the patient’s own skin in a skin graft), an allograft (using human skin from a donor), or a variety of skin substitutes to provide a skin-like barrier while the margin of the wound heals through secondary intention and contraction. Historically, harvest and placement of autologous full-thickness skin results in the best outcome within wound beds because it most closely resembles the full-thickness skin that was lost. However, full-thickness harvest of skin also results in a full-thickness skin defect at the donor site, which requires primary closure (skin edge approximation and suturing) so as not to leave a gaping wound behind. Because of this absolute limit on how much autologous full-thickness donor skin can be harvested without leaving behind a non-closable wound, medical professionals can only harvest small, elliptically shaped pieces of such skin from areas of redundancy, which is termed full-thickness skin grafting (“FTSG”).
 
It is because there remains only a finite supply of FTSG donor material and sites that medical professionals often rely on the harvest of split-thickness skin grafts (“STSG”) for coverage of voids of the integument to get better coverage and more skin. STSGs, however, do not represent the true anatomy or function of native skin because STSG harvest procedures commonly take the top 1/10,000th of an inch of the patient’s own skin and therefore do not capture all the necessary cellular and tissue components and structures required for the regeneration of normal skin.

-


Because of the failure to harvest all the necessary skin structures and components from the STSG donor site, the patient is left with an incomplete top layer of skin covering the initial defect (recipient site) and a remaining bottom layer at the donor site. In this setting, both donor and recipient sites contain incomplete skin, which often results in dysfunctional, painful scar tissues and lifelong morbidities.
 
Due to the limits of STSG and FTSG and the type of procedures required for such harvests, the industry has continued to investigate skin substitutes and skin alternatives that can be used in place of native skin. Among these alternatives or options are a cultured epithelial autograft (a form of manipulated autograft), allograft (tissue grafts derived from a donor of the same species as the recipient but not genetically identical), xenograft (a tissue graft or organ transplant from a donor of a different species from the recipient), and engineered skin substitutes. To our knowledge, none of these substitutes have been able to regenerate the cutaneous appendages (e.g., hair follicle, sweat gland, sebaceous glands, etc.), which are necessary for the development of full-thickness, normal skin.
 
Our Solution - SkinTE
 
The core technology of SkinTE is minimally polarized functional units (“MPFUs”). MPFUs are multi-cellular segments created from a piece of the patient’s healthy skin. SkinTE allows the patient to regenerate full-thickness, three-dimensional skin (similar to a FTSG) by contributing a much smaller skin sample, while reducing the scarring and morbidities associated with STSGs, and producing results we believe to be superior to STSGs and synthetic skin substitutes. SkinTE can be utilized by a variety of health care providers in an operating room, wound clinic, or doctor’s office. The process begins with the collection of a skin sample from the patient and shipping the sample in a temperature-controlled shipping box to our FDA-regulated biomedical manufacturing facility. The harvested skin is used to manufacture SkinTE, which is expeditiously returned for application to the patient’s wound. Processing of the skin creates multi-cellular segments that are optimized for grafting, which retain the progenitor cells found throughout the skin, including the hair follicles. The product is not cultured or expanded ex-vivo, and no enzymes, growth factors, or serum derivatives are utilized during manufacturing. The final product, SkinTE, is delivered in a syringe and has the consistency of a paste. Following wound bed preparation, SkinTE is spread evenly across the entire surface of the wound and engrafts within the wound in a similar manner to traditional skin grafts. Once integrated with the wound bed, the product expands and regenerates full-thickness skin across the entire surface.
 
Given our significant real-world experience with SkinTE in clinical settings for a variety of wounds and several supporting publications, we believe SkinTE can be successful in closing full-thickness complex wounds, such as DFUs penetrating to tendon, capsule, and bone classified Wagner Grades 2 through 4; Stage 3 and 4 pressure injuries; and, acute wounds. Full-thickness DFUs that penetrate to deep structures are best classified as University of Texas Grades 2 and 3, corresponding to Wagner Grades 2 through 4, and are at the highest risk for progressing to amputation with very few treatment options and a paucity of high-level data related to current treatment options. Similarly, Stage 3 pressure injuries involve the entire thickness of the skin and Stage 4 pressure injuries have exposed muscle, tendon, or bone. Due to limited reliable solutions, these injuries affect a large number of people for extended periods of time. We believe that focusing our efforts in these hard-to-treat wound types, where there are significant unmet needs, can deliver substantial positive impacts in patients’ lives and value for the SkinTE franchise for several reasons.
 

● | Although these distinct wound types may occur in patients with different demographics and have different etiologies, they have common characteristics including significant wound depth, significant wound volume, frequent presence of tunneling and undermining, and exposure of critical structures. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Wounds with these characteristics often require multiple treatment stages in order to fill volume and cover exposed structures before proceeding to traditional skin grafts or more invasive reconstruction. There is a paucity of high-level data to guide the progression through these treatment options. 
● | In our experience, wound care providers are focused on finding better treatments due to their unaddressed challenges and the seriousness of their outcomes, where failure of treatments may result in both the acute occurrence and elevated lifetime risk of amputation, long-term disability, and death.

Clinically, we believe SkinTE is highly differentiated from current treatment alternatives in these hard-to-treat wound types. In real-world experience and data from preliminary studies conducted to date, we believe that SkinTE has covered exposed critical structures, completely filled in wound depth including tunnelling, and ultimately provided complete and durable wound closure with the regenerated tissue having many of the important characteristics of native skin such as pliability, strength, sensation, ability to sweat, and hair growth. In contrast to a multi-staged approach combining numerous treatments in an algorithm dictated by wound progression, SkinTE can be applied directly into deep wounds with exposed structures, typically requires only a single application in the vast majority of cases and, unlike other products in this space, may not require a skin graft to achieve final closure. In our experience, providers treating complex wounds are most concerned with reliably covering deep structures, as this mitigates a substantial risk factor for the patient and converts the wound to a lower grade that is more manageable. We believe that covering deep structures and filling wound volume with newly generated vascular tissue is an important advantage of SkinTE and differentiates SkinTE from other treatments that have increased failure rates in these hard-to-treat wound settings. Another valuable aspect of SkinTE clinically is that it is created from a relatively small skin harvest that is well tolerated by the patient.
 
We believe that patients with complex wounds face significant unmet needs, and that providers are motivated to better address them. If our future clinical trials conducted under an IND demonstrate outcomes similar to those observed in real-world experience and preliminary clinical studies, we believe that SkinTE has the potential to shift practice patterns, accelerate adoption, and capture a significant portion of these hard-to-treat wound markets.
 
Clinical Trials
 
We have initiated and completed several clinical trials and have additional clinical trials underway. All clinical trials to date have been conducted on a post-marketing basis with SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P. As we transition to a BLA, and as discussed in more detail under “Our Plan for Advancing SkinTE” below, we will be conducting additional clinical trials once we have an open IND for SkinTE with the FDA, and we expect that those registration trials will be used to support our eventual BLA submission. We believe that the data from our clinical trials to date, however, are valuable as robust evidence of the strong safety and efficacy profile of SkinTE, and plan to include information from these trials in our IND submission to the FDA.
Burns and Traumatic Wounds
 
We initiated a head-to-head trial comparing SkinTE to the STSG, the clinical standard of care, in the first quarter of 2018. Eight patients were enrolled in the trial and the primary endpoint for the trial was graft take. Data from the trial was published in the Journal of Burn Care & Research in September 2020. Eight patients with deep-partial/full thickness burns had a portion of their wounds treated with SkinTE and the remainder of their burn treated with split-thickness skin grafting. The SkinTE treated wounds had graft take and achieved closure by their last follow-up with a single application. There were no related adverse events pertaining to the SkinTE applications in the trial.
Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Trials
 
DFUs are chronic wounds and represent one of the most costly, and medically significant, health related morbidities encountered during a patient’s lifetime. The estimated annual US payor burden of DFU ranges from $9.1 billion to $13.2 billion according to a 2014 article in Diabetes Care, a publication of the American Diabetes Association. The outpatient management of DFUs represents the major contributing cost to the health care system. Inadequate assessment and management with chronicity of treatment is one of the primary cost drivers and failures of care.
 
SkinTE was used to treat 10 patients (11 DFUs) in a pilot trial completed in June 2019, and first reported at the Symposium on Advanced Wound Care Fall 2019. The following are the results as determined by independent review:
 

● | 10 of 11 (90.9%) DFUs healed within eight weeks of a single application of SkinTE 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Median time to closure was 25 days 
● | DFU sizes ranged from 1.0 to 21.7 cm2 
● | One patient was removed from the study at week three due to adverse events not related to the study or SkinTE procedure 
● | No SkinTE-related adverse reactions were observed

We are now engaged in a multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluating SkinTE plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone in treatment of DFU (the DFU RCT). The size of the study is 100 patients and the final patient was enrolled in January 2021. The primary endpoint is percentage of ulcers closed at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include percent area reduction (PAR) at 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks, quality of life assessment at 12 weeks, pain assessment at 12 weeks, peripheral neuropathy assessment at 12 weeks, and cost-effectiveness.
 
In July 2020, we reported data from an interim analysis of the DFU RCT. The analysis was based on 25 SkinTE/SOC patients and 25 SOC patients at 13 sites across the United States. All patients received only one application of SkinTE, except two patients who received reapplication due to inadvertent removal of the original product (mean 1.08 applications per SkinTE/SOC subject). Key demographics included:
 

Mean wound area (cm2): | | Mean wound age (weeks):
-----------------------+-----+------------------------
SkinTE/SOC: | 4.3 | | SkinTE/SOC: | 25.3
SOC: | 3.3 | | SOC: | 22.1



For the primary endpoint, 18 of 25 DFUs (72%) in the SkinTE/SOC group closed at 12 weeks, 8 of 25 DFUs (32%) in the SOC group closed at 12 weeks, and the associated p-value for these results is 0.005. For the PAR secondary endpoint, the interim analysis showed:
 

Week | SkinTE/SOC | SOC | p-value
-----+------------+-------+--------
4 | 78.6% | 24.0% | 0.00021
6 | 83.2% | 43.8% | 0.004 
8 | 86.6% | 47.2% | 0.002 
12 | 88.2% | 49.6% | 0.012 

 
Furthermore, there was no significant difference between SkinTE/SOC closed wounds and SOC closed wounds with respect to the quality of life assessment at 12 weeks, pain assessment at 12 weeks, and peripheral neuropathy assessment at 12 weeks. In our interim analysis for the DFU RCT we calculated mean total product cost per patient by multiplying current pricing for SkinTE by the number of applications required per patient (1.08 mean applications per patient), resulting in a SkinTE mean total product cost per treated wound of $1,311.20.
 
Venous Leg Ulcer (VLU) Trials
 
VLUs are a type of chronic wound and constitute a significant burden on the worldwide health care system and are often refractory to treatment. Up to one-third of treated patients experience four or more episodes of recurrence. Delivering all the elements of native skin can potentially reduce the recurrence rate.
 
SkinTE was used to treat 10 patients in a pilot trial completed in September 2019, and first reported at the Symposium on Advanced Wound Care Fall 2019, where we received recognition as Best Abstract. The following are the results as determined by independent review:
 

● | 8 of 10 (80%) VLUs closed within 12 weeks of a single application of SkinTE 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Of the two VLUs not deemed closed within 12 weeks: one VLU was the largest in the study (12.2cm2), and closed within 13.5 weeks post a single application of SkinTE; one VLU was previously deemed closed, and reopened prior to the two-week durability visit as a result of external factors unrelated to the SkinTE procedure 
● | Median time to closure was 21 days 
● | No SkinTE-related adverse reactions were observed 

 
We started a multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluating SkinTE versus standard of care in treatment of VLU, but decided in the first quarter of 2021 to suspend that trial after 30 patients were enrolled because we believed that our resources would be better used in future clinical trials conducted under an open IND that can be used in our eventual planned BLA submission.

Market Opportunity
 
The primary markets for SkinTE are wounds from traumatic injury, chronic wounds (including DFUs, VLUs, and pressure ulcers), burn wounds, and acute wounds, such as traumatic wounds and wounds from surgical procedures.

● | We believe SkinTE is suitable for treating a number of acute wounds. In 2017 the inpatient traumatic injury rate was 524.3 persons for every 100,000 people. This resulted in an estimated 1.8 million traumatic injuries per year requiring inpatient hospitalization of which approximately 5% are directly related to open wounds. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The National Diabetes Statistics Report published in 2020 by the Centers for Disease Control stated that there are approximately 34.2 million diabetes sufferers in the United States. The American Diabetes Association report on the economic costs of diabetes in 2017 states that the direct medical cost of diabetes in that year was $237 billion. A 2005 article estimated the number of DFUs at between 1.2 and 3.0 million, and a 2003 article estimated the prevalence of unhealed DFUs after 12 weeks of conventional treatment at between 1.0 and 2.5 million. The estimated annual US payor burden of DFU ranges from $9.1 billion to $13.2 billion according to a 2014 article in Diabetes Care. 
● | A 2010 article reports the prevalence of venous ulcers at approximately 600,000 annually, and a subsequent 2014 article reports that on average between 33% and 66% of these ulcers persist for six weeks and are, therefore, referred to as chronic, resulting in approximately 200-360 thousand patients per year that we believe would be potential candidates for treatment with SkinTE. 
● | Pressure Ulcers are common in hospital systems, increase patient morbidity and mortality, and are costly for patients and the healthcare system. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) there are more than 2.5 million individuals that develop pressure ulcers annually, and approximately 600-700 thousand people are admitted to hospitals with one or more pressure ulcers. Of these ulcers, approximately 77% are treated with both topical therapies and excisional surgical debridement. 
● | The American Burn Association estimates that every year over 450,000 serious burn injuries occur in the United States that require medical treatment and that approximately 40,000 of these resulted in hospitalization. 

 
Our Plan for Advancing SkinTE
 
As discussed above under “Overview,” we decided in April 2020 to pursue the preparation and filing with the FDA of an IND and BLA for SkinTE. Consequently, in May 2020 we effectuated a reduction in force within our regenerative medicine business segment to reduce monthly cash burn. At the end of 2020 we had approximately 10 salespeople and six clinical science staff that supported the sales team. In the coming months we will pursue the preparation of an IND filing with the FDA, which we believe we will be able to file in the second half of 2021.
 
In August 2020 we submitted a Type B Pre-IND meeting request to FDA regarding an indication for SkinTE to treat DFUs, and we received written responses to our meeting request and questions in October 2020. FDA’s responses included, among other things, feedback, and recommendations on SkinTE manufacturing, preclinical studies, and clinical data submitted in the Company’s briefing package, and guidance on additional information for the Company to include in its IND submission. Consistent with published FDA guidance documents, including “Guidance for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products,” the Agency stated that for a condition like DFUs, it would generally expect at least two adequate and well-controlled studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety to support a future marketing application. The Agency noted that our ongoing DFU RCT has elements of an adequate and well-controlled study but stated that it would not accept our ongoing post-marketing DFU RCT as one of the two adequate and well-controlled studies to support a future marketing application.
 
Based on FDA’s feedback and our real-world experience with SkinTE, we plan to pursue multiple indications addressing complex wounds, including wounds with exposed critical structures. The initial indications we plan to pursue are DFUs penetrating to tendon, capsule, and bone classified Wagner Grades 2 through 4 (corresponding to University of Texas Grades 2 and 3), Stage 3 and 4 pressure injuries, and acute wounds. These wound types occur in patients with different demographics and have different etiologies, but they have common characteristics including significant wound depth, significant wound volume, frequent presence of tunnelling and undermining, and exposure of critical structures. We believe much of the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) work, as well as preclinical work, that we would do for our initial IND in the DFU indication can be leveraged for multiple subsequent indications. Our present intention is to focus our efforts on an initial IND submission for the above-referenced DFU indication and make further IND submissions to develop the indications for pressure injuries and acute wounds either in parallel or a tight sequential process.

The Company has maintained a collaborative dialogue with the FDA and will continue to work closely with the FDA as it progresses towards its BLA submission. Upon BLA approval, we believe that SkinTE we will have 12 years of data exclusivity with regard to potential biosimilars.
 
Biological Product License Application (BLA) Pathway
 
Biological products subject to BLA requirements are approved under the Public Health Service Act. Biological products require FDA approval of a BLA to be marketed. In order to be approved, a BLA must demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate based on results of preclinical studies and clinical trials. A BLA must also contain extensive CMC and other manufacturing information, and the applicant must pass an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements for biologics typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. We cannot be certain that any BLA approvals for our products will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 
The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biologic product in the U.S. ordinarily include:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and include independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval before the trials may be initiated; 
● | performance of one or more adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes, and full data sets of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product; 
● | satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and 
● | FDA approval of the BLA including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable. 

 
Preclinical tests typically include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies, and an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. In our communications with the FDA, the FDA has informed us that its current position is that additional preclinical studies are not required to support initiation of a clinical trial once the IND is effective, but this is not a final determination, and the Company still expects to conduct certain additional preclinical work as part of its SkinTE development program, including a toxicology study conducted under Good Laboratory Practices with a three-month terminal timepoint.
 
The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials and or supporting preclinical data as outlined in the IND. In that case, the sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. In other words, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
We plan to submit an IND for SkinTE for the treatment of certain DFUs in the second half of 2021, and plan to commence clinical trials for this indication shortly after the IND becomes effective.

Our SkinTE Sales Activity in 2020
 
We have observed that the sales process is affected by several factors, including the receptiveness of the physician to consider and then adopt a new therapeutic approach, facility administrative approval where required, the nature and type of wounds treated at a target account, and the incidence of wound care cases at target accounts. We also believe that the previous lack of SkinTE clinical trials, which we were not required to obtain before commercialization as a 361 HCT/P, has adversely affected the willingness of healthcare providers to use SkinTE.
 
In the first part of 2020 the sales process for SkinTE met a new challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in March 2020, which grew rapidly in the United States as spring began. Throughout the country, healthcare assets in terms of facilities and providers were marshalled and dedicated to the care and treatment of COVID-19 patients while still trying to meet the acute and traumatic care needs of the general population. Consequently, medical care and procedures that are considered “elective” were put on hold in many regions across the country. Many of the initial economic effects in the healthcare industry of the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and the shift in healthcare resources occurred during the last three weeks of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and we observed that some SkinTE procedures planned for the second calendar quarter were postponed, cancelled, or not scheduled as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact was most evident in chronic wounds without amputation risk. As a result of the shift in patient care due to COVID-19, other challenges in the sales offering, and the shift in our regulatory pathway for SkinTE, beginning in May 2020, our commercial team focused the sales effort on regions where we had repeat customers that are hospital groups or large facilities that treat acute and traumatic wounds conditions. Consequently, in 2020 38% of our net revenues from SkinTE sales were generated at one hospital system.
 
SkinTE’s pricing structure is designed to be competitive in the marketplace and reflects SkinTE’s ability to deliver durable, functional full-thickness skin replacement with only one application, compared to the costly practice of regular wound care over a long period of time. Our practice has been to work closely with our customers to ensure that pricing is not a barrier to use of SkinTE for patient care.
 
We have continued to sell SkinTE in 2021, but as discussed above under “Overview” we may need to cease selling SkinTE if FDA enforcement discretion ends and while a BLA is pending until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market SkinTE for the indications that have been approved in the BLA.
 
Payment and Reimbursement
 
Inpatient Setting.
 
In the inpatient setting, facility reimbursement is dictated by the associated bundled Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment for the entire episode of care under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The bundled DRG facility payment is determined by the DRG code applied, which factors in the primary diagnosis and patient characteristics, such as co-morbidities present on admission. In this scenario, all products and supplies utilized during the episode of care are paid for with the bundled DRG facility payment, including products like SkinTE. In addition, physician services are billed and reimbursed outside of the bundled DRG facility payment, including any procedures performed during that admission, which are billed for and reimbursed utilizing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes associated with the respective procedures. SkinTE has been used within the inpatient setting and reimbursed underneath the applicable DRG bundled facility payments, and to our knowledge all associated procedures billed for outside the DRG as physician services with CPT codes have been reimbursed, as well.
Hospital Outpatient Department (HOPD) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Setting.
 
Like the inpatient setting, bundled Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) facility payments are received under the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) for services and supplies utilized for procedures within Hospital Outpatient Departments (HOPDs) and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs). In these settings, bundled APC facility payments are dictated by the procedures performed and billed for through the appropriate CPT codes. SkinTE has been used in these settings and covered with the associated bundled APC facility payments and physician services have been paid for outside of the APC payment utilizing CPT codes to bill for the associated procedures.

Office or Clinic Setting.
 
In contrast to the inpatient, HOPD, and ASC settings, care provided in a physician office or clinic is reimbursed based on individual Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and CPT codes, facilitating reimbursement for the specific products utilized and procedures performed during the clinic visit. The CPT codes used in the setting are the same or similar to the CPT codes used to bill for physician services in the other settings of care. We believe there are appropriate Level 1 CPT Codes within the Full Thickness Skin Graft code category, in addition to Surgical Preparation codes with appropriate modifiers (52 & 58) that are appropriate for SkinTE.
Development Projects
 
Preparing and filing our IND with the FDA and beginning necessary clinical trials are the focus of our operational activity. We have development projects, however, that we believe will add value to SkinTE if and when we obtain pre-market approval.
 
SkinTE Cryo
 
SkinTE Cryo allows us to offer multiple deployments from one original harvest through a cryopreservation process. We believe this is a valuable offering that will enhance our SkinTE product offering for several reasons. Using one harvest for multiple deployments may improve patient treatment when a patient is susceptible to multiple chronic wounds, the provider suspects a patient might require a second deployment of SkinTE due to past non-compliance with rehab protocols, or the provider elects to use a staged deployment on a patient with a large wound due to wound location or other therapeutic circumstances. SkinTE Cryo is in the development stage and is a long-term development project.
 
SkinTE POC
 
Our SkinTE point-of-care device is intended to permit the processing and deployment of SkinTE immediately following the initial harvest at the point-of-care. SkinTE POC is in the development stage and is a long-term development project.
 
PTE 11000
 
PTE 11000 is an allogenic, biologically active dressing for use in wound care and aesthetics to accelerate healing of skin. It is a composition made using cadaveric tissue via a proprietary process. It is currently in the preclinical phase of development and we cannot predict when that phase may be complete.
Other Potential Products
 
We believe our innovative technologies may be platforms for developing therapies that address a variety of indications, including bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, and neural elements, as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. For the foreseeable future, however, we intend to apply our business and financial resources to the SkinTE IND and BLA, and SkinTE-related projects described above, and we have at this time put on hold further development work on OsteoTE and products related to other tissue substrates so that we can focus our resources on SkinTE.
Manufacturing
 
Throughout 2020 we maintained at our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, manufacturing processes and quality systems that allow us to receive a skin specimen, qualify the incoming tissue, process and manufacture the SkinTE tissue product, and perform outgoing quality control and quality assurance work prior to shipping. We validated our manufacturing process as being aseptic. All SkinTE is manufactured within an ISO 5 isolator located within an ISO 7 cleanroom. Our processes are designed and validated to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and to prevent cross-contamination between samples. Our quality systems comply with current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTP”) under 21 C.F.R. Part 1271.

-


In connection with the preparation of our IND we are making plans to modify our manufacturing practices and facility so that we comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) under 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211, and other applicable regulations, which are in addition to cGTP referenced above.
 
Suppliers
 
As part of our strategy of ensuring timely delivery of our products, we have avoided relying on any third-party supplier as a sole source vendor for any element of our production process. We have identified alternate suppliers and, where appropriate, supply alternatives for any sourcing challenges.
Intellectual Property
 
As we advance our platform technology, product, and pipeline developments, we seek to apply a multilayered approach for protecting intellectual property relating to our innovation with patents (utility and design), copyrights, trademarks, as well as know-how and trade secret protection. We are actively seeking U.S. and foreign patent protection in selected jurisdictions for a variety of technologies, including our MPFU technology, our Complex Living Interface Coordinated Self-Assembling Materials (“CLICSAM”) Technology, our Composite-Interfacing, Biomaterial Accelerant Substrate (“CIBAS”) Technology, as well as Biological Sample Harvest and Deployment Kits. We have a number of patents issued and pending applications allowed in the United States and abroad related to our MPFU technology, including U.S. Patent No. 10,926,001 which issued on February 23, 2021. U.S. Patent No. 10,926,001 was filed on November 30, 2015 as Application No. 14/954,335 and thus has an estimated expiration date of November 30, 2035.
 
Patent terms extend for varying periods of time according to the date of patent filing or grant and the pertinent law in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in certain countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of certain products.
 
The U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010 created an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products that did not previously exist. Prior to that time, innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a “biosimilar” version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA.
 
In the United States, the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators’ basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions in the United States limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity.

In striving to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, we also rely heavily on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology and on know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
We seek to complement the protection of our innovation with a portfolio of trademarks and service marks in the United States and around the world. The POLARITYTE trademark has been registered in the United States and in other countries throughout the world. Additional registered trademarks in the United States include our logo, WELCOME TO THE SHIFT, WHERE SELF REGENERATES SELF, and SKINTE.
 
Competition
 
The regenerative medicine industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from companies developing and selling regenerative medicine products, as well as academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than products that we develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 
Contract Research Services
 
In May 2018, we purchased the assets of a preclinical research sciences business and related real estate from Ibex Group, L.L.C., a Utah limited liability company, and Ibex Preclinical Research, Inc., a Utah corporation. We acquired these assets to accelerate research and development of our product candidates, and now operate the business as IBEX to advance our product development and deliver preclinical research services to third parties. The business consists of a preclinical research facility that that complies with Good Laboratory Practices and is USDA registered and includes vivarium, operating rooms, preparation rooms, storage facilities, and surgical and imaging equipment. The real property includes two parcels in Logan, Utah, consisting of approximately 1.75 combined gross acres of land, together with the buildings, structures, fixtures, and personal property located on the real property.
 
Arches offers a complimentary array of research services to those offered through IBEX, providing access to experimental planning, histology, and in vivo and in vitro imaging, including micro-ct. Arches is well equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and sophisticated research staff that provide a range of services including veterinary and preclinical services, advanced imaging, biomedical engineering and validation, and molecular biology assays.
 
There was a substantial surge in COVID-19 testing throughout the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the spring of 2020. In the course of its operations, Arches maintains equipment and staff capable of performing molecular polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) testing for COVID-19. We had the opportunity to use our research facilities to offer laboratory testing services for COVID-19, and to that end registered under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) in May 2020, and we began providing COVID-19 testing services on May 27, 2020. We believe that COVID-19 testing offers an opportunity to use existing resources to generate additional revenue and thereby help defray our operating expenses. We pursued this opportunity through the end of 2020 and expect to continue to do so as long as we believe COVID-19 testing services are beneficial to supporting our operations.

On September 2, 2020, Arches entered into two agreements with Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (“Co-Diagnostics”). The COVID-19 Laboratory Services Agreement between the parties provides that Arches will perform specimen testing services for customers referred by Co-Diagnostics to Arches. Co-Diagnostics will arrange all logistics for delivering specimens to Arches for COVID-19 testing for those customers of Co-Diagnostics electing to use the service. Arches bills Co-Diagnostics for the testing services and Co-Diagnostics manages all customer billing. The Rental Agreement for LGC Genomics Oktopure Extraction Machine between Arches and Co-Diagnostics provides that Co-Diagnostics will make available to Arches the Oktopure high throughput extraction machine that Arches will use to perform COVID-19 testing. The term of the agreement is 12 months, requires Arches to use Co-Diagnostics tests exclusively in the machine, and establishes for Arches a minimum monthly purchase obligation for Co-Diagnostics tests and related consumables used in the testing process.
 
Competition for COVID-19 testing is intense with a large number of participants providing testing services. Many of our current competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources, testing resources, laboratory personnel, expertise, and marketing resources than we do. We are only able to offer our testing services in states where Arches is licensed or registered to provide laboratory testing services or where an emergency order or authorization allows unlicensed laboratories to provide COVID-19 testing, which limits the geographical market we can serve. We are a relatively unknown testing laboratory, so we have relied on word of mouth and management relationships to connect with prospects and vied for new business on the basis of price and service. During 2020 we had testing agreements with multiple nursing home and pharmacy facilities in the state of New York controlled by a single company that accounted for 96% of COVID-19 testing revenues in 2020. We were fortunate to obtain our major customer for testing services, which was a result of a direct relationship with management, and we have been able to retain this customer on the basis of price and service. We provide testing services in New York in reliance on monthly executive orders and authorizations that require regular testing of staff in these facilities and permit laboratories not licensed in New York to provide those services. On March 26, 2021, we were advised by the company that controls the New York nursing homes and pharmacy facilities we service that the state of New York is allowing on-site employee testing and that on-site testing will be implemented for the New York facilities we service, which will likely have the effect of substantially diminishing our revenues from COVID-19 testing after the first quarter of 2021.
 
We offer PCR testing for COVID-19, which is the current industry standard for accuracy of results. A number of companies, as well as academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, are pursuing the development of new COVID-19 tests that purport to be faster, easier, and less expensive than PCR testing. The successful development of such a test could substantially diminish the demand for the PCR testing we offer.
 
Government Regulation
 
FDA Regulation of Tissue-Based Products
 
The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. In the United States, HCT/Ps are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FDA, depending on if they fall solely within the scope of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHS Act”) (42 U.S.C. § 264) or if they are regulated as drugs, devices, or biological products under Section 351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. § 262) and the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”). Under this two-tiered framework, certain higher risk HCT/Ps are regulated as new biologics. Manufacturers of new biologics must complete extensive clinical trials, which must be conducted pursuant to an effective IND. In addition, the FDA must review and approve a BLA before a new biologic may be marketed.
 
If an HCT/P meets the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (so-called “361 HCT/Ps”), no premarket FDA review for safety and effectiveness under a drug, device, or biological product marketing application is required. The processor of the 361 HCT/P is required to register and list its products with the FDA, comply with regulations regarding labeling, record keeping, donor eligibility and screening and testing, process the tissue in accordance with established cGTP, and investigate and, in certain circumstances, report adverse reactions or deviations.

--


To be a 361 HCT/P, a product generally must meet all four of the following criteria:
 

● | It must be minimally manipulated; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It must be intended for homologous use; 
● | Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent, provided the addition of such article does not raise new clinical safety concerns; and 
● | It must not have a systemic effect and must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function (unless the product is intended for reproductive use, autologous use, or use in a first- or second-degree blood relative). 

 
We believe that SkinTE qualifies as a 361 HCT/P. Following informal, voluntary discussions between us and the FDA we were advised by the FDA in April 2020 that its preliminary assessment is that SkinTE does not meet the requirements to be regulated solely as a 361 HCT/P. Rather, the FDA’s preliminary assessment was that SkinTE is a biological product that should be regulated under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. We re-evaluated our regulatory approach and determined it is prudent to submit an IND for SkinTE and an eventual BLA because we believe it will create a more valuable asset with a greater likelihood of achieving widespread commercial adoption, and to avoid the possibility of a protracted dispute with the FDA. As a result of the change in the regulatory approach for SkinTE, we decided to adjust our SkinTE commercial operations accordingly.
 
All establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps must register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) within five days after commencing operations. In addition, establishments are required to update their registration annually in December or within 30 days of certain changes and submit changes in HCT/P listing at the time of or within six months of such change. Establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps will know that they are registered in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10(a) when they receive a validated form with the Federal Establishment Identification number after submitting the Form FDA 3356 (registration form). cGTP requirements govern, as may be applicable, the facilities, controls, and methods used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including without limitation, recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution of 361 HCT/Ps. During the enforcement discretion period, the FDA is permitting products that will become regulated under Section 351 to be manufactured in compliance with cGTP regulations. After the end of the enforcement discretion period, however, these products will be subject to cGMP compliance. The transition from cGTP to cGMP compliance includes development and enhancement of production processes, procedures, tests, and assays, and it requires extensive validation work. It can also involve the procurement and installation of new production or lab equipment. These efforts require expertise and resources.
 
FDA inspection and enforcement with respect to establishments described in 21 C.F.R. Part 1271 includes inspections conducted, as deemed necessary, to determine compliance with the applicable provisions and may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of the establishment’s facilities, equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, processes, HCT/Ps, procedures, labeling, records, files, papers, and controls required to be maintained under 21 C.F.R. Part 1271. Such inspections can occur at any time with or without written notice at such frequency as is determined by the FDA in its sole discretion.
 
The Tissue Reference Group (“TRG”) is a body within the FDA designed to provide recommendations regarding whether a product candidate will be regulated as a 361 HCT/P. The Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) at FDA provides informal, non-binding recommendations and formal, binding designations regarding the classification of products as 361 HCT/Ps or drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Product manufacturers are not required to consult with the TRG or OCP and instead can market their products based on their own conclusion that the product meets the 361 HCT/P criteria. We have not consulted the TRG or sought a formal designation from the OCP, though we have had informal interactions with OCP.

If we fail to comply with the FDA regulations and laws applicable to our operation or tissue products, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, pursuing any of the following sanctions, among others:
 

● | Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, product seizures, and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Orders for product retention, recall, or destruction; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of operations; 
● | Refusing any requests for product clearance or approval; 
● | Withdrawing or suspending any applications for approval or approvals already granted; or 
● | Criminal prosecution. 

 
For more information on this regulatory risk, please see the discussion below, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the information under the heading, “Risks Related to Registration or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations.”
 
Regulation of Clinical Laboratories
 
Virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the United States must be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. In most cases, that certification is regulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) through CLIA, which requires that applicable clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.
 
Arches has been issued a CLIA Certificate of Registration (“CLIA Certificate”) to accept human specimens for the purpose of performing laboratory examinations or procedures. The CLIA Certificate was issued on April 20, 2020 and is valid until April 19, 2022, but is subject to revocation, suspension, limitation, or other sanctions for violations of applicable laws or regulations.
 
Arches is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records.
 
We believe Arches is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements. Its laboratory has continuing programs to ensure that Arches’ operations meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the laboratory will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.
 
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and other potential referral sources for our products pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and similar laws. In addition, federal and state laws are sometimes open to interpretation. We could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time we could be at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.
 
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of, a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of HHS (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, exempt certain remuneration and remunerative arrangements from violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as OIG. Many states have laws similar to the federal law.
 

14
--


Also, the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes others to submit, a false or fraudulent claim for payment (e.g., by the Medicare or Medicaid programs) to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant, and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties, as well as possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the government’s recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the government’s damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The U.S. Department of Justice takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks, may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid by health care providers that use the manufacturer’s products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, in order to settle allegations under the FCA, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements (“CIAs”) that require, among other things, substantial government oversight, as well as reporting and remedial actions going forward
 
If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to:
 

● | Multi-year investigations by federal and state governments; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Criminal and civil fines and penalties; 
● | Obligations under settlement agreements, such as CIAs or deferred prosecution agreements; or 
● | Exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. 

Environmental Matters
 
Our research, development and tissue preservation activities generate some chemical and biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of diluted alcohols and acids, and human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The chemical and biomedical wastes generated by our research, development and tissue processing operations are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes. We contract with third parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of waste. We strive to remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies.
Reimbursement
 
In the United States, demand for access to any medical product will depend in large part on both the availability and the amount of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and commercial healthcare insurers, such as managed care organizations and other private health plans. Third-party payers have complex rules and requirements for coverage and reimbursement of healthcare products and services. Even the applications to such third-party payers to be eligible for reimbursement for product or services are complex and can be lengthy and time consuming. For new technologies coming to market, these payers are increasingly examining the clinical evidence supporting medical necessity and cost effectiveness decisions in addition to safety and efficacy, which can result in barriers to early coverage reimbursement, or denial of coverage and reimbursement altogether. Accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the availability of coverage and reimbursement status for new medical products. If third-party payer reimbursement is unavailable to our customer hospitals, physicians, and providers, our sales may be limited, and we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
Payers often set payment rates depending on the site of service and many use the Medicare program as a benchmark for their own payment methodologies. In the hospital inpatient setting, Medicare payment generally is set at pre-determined rates for all products and services provided during a patient stay and is based on such factors as the patient diagnosis, procedures performed, patient age, and complications. In the physician office or clinic setting, Medicare payment generally is based on a fee schedule, with payment rates set for each procedure performed and product used, although the schedule may in some instance bundle the product into the payment for the procedure. In some outpatient settings, such as in the case of the hospital outpatient clinic setting, Medicare payment rates generally are premised on classifications of services that have similar clinical characteristics and similar costs.
 

15
--


Reimbursement policies depend in part on legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry and federal and state governments continue to propose and pass new healthcare legislation and government agencies revise or change their regulations and policies from time to time. We cannot predict whether or how such reform measures and policy changes would affect reimbursement rates and demand for our products.
 
Patient Privacy
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Because our products use autologous tissue sources that are tracked and reapplied to the same individual patient from which the tissue was harvested, our business maintains substantial amounts of patient identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties. Since we do not submit claims electronically to payers, we do not believe we are a covered entity under HIPAA.
Transparency Laws
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We do not believe that we are a covered manufacturer under the statute because our products are neither regulated as pharmaceuticals, biologics, nor medical devices by the FDA, and 361 HCT/Ps are not expressly addressed by this law. We do, however, voluntarily file annual reports because we believe it enhances our reputation in the medical industry to be transparent about what we do and how we do it, and if we receive a BLA approval, we will be required to report certain information under applicable transparency laws.
USDA
 
The Company and its subsidiaries conduct preclinical research and development, which is regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) and must be performed in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, Animal Welfare Regulations, and Animal Care Policies. The Company and each of its subsidiaries that conduct preclinical research have in place Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees to oversee compliance with the animal care and use program and report accordingly to the USDA on an at least a semi-annual basis. All sites that maintain USDA-covered species are actively registered as USDA research facilities.
Employees
 
We had approximately 80 full-time employees and five part-time employees as of December 31, 2020, all of whom are in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Corporate History
 
Majesco Entertainment Company, a Delaware corporation (“Majesco DE”), was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 8, 1998. On December 1, 2016, Majesco Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Majesco DE, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with PolarityTE, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“PolarityTE NV”) and the sole stockholder of PolarityTE NV. The asset acquisition was subject to stockholder approval, which was received on March 10, 2017, and the transaction closed on April 7, 2017. In January 2017, Majesco DE changed its name to “PolarityTE, Inc.” (“PolarityTE”). Majesco Acquisition Corp. was then merged with PolarityTE NV, which remains a subsidiary of PolarityTE. Majesco Acquisition Corp. II, formed in November 2016 under Majesco Entertainment Company, changed its name to “PolarityTE MD, Inc.,” and remains a wholly owned subsidiary of PolarityTE.
 
Prior to the acquisition of PolarityTE NV, Majesco DE developed and published a wide range of video games on digital networks through its Midnight City label. On May 2, 2017, Majesco Entertainment Company, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of PolarityTE (“Majesco NV Sub”), was formed, into which all the assets and liabilities of this gaming business were placed. On June 23, 2017, PolarityTE sold the Majesco NV Sub to Zift Interactive LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Zift”), pursuant to a purchase agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, PolarityTE sold 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Majesco NV Sub to Zift, including all the right, title, and interest in and to Majesco NV Sub’s business of developing, publishing, and distributing video game products.
 
In May 2018 we acquired assets of a preclinical research and veterinary sciences business and related real estate, which we now operate through IBEX. The aggregate purchase price was $3.8 million, of which $2.3 million was paid at closing and the balance satisfied by a promissory note payable to the seller with an initial fair value of $1.22 million and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of approximately $0.3 million. As a result, we have significant research facilities and a well-educated and skilled team of scientists and researchers that perform research on our development projects and comprise the contract research segment of our business.
 
Summary Risk Factors
 
The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report and the other reports and documents filed by us with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Risks Related to Our Financial Condition
 

● | We have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We will need additional funding in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are unable to successfully raise additional capital, our future clinical trials and product development could be limited, and our long-term viability may be threatened. 
● | We plan to devote a majority of our financial and human resources to pursue an IND and BLA for SkinTE, which means we may fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 
● | Our wholly owned subsidiary accepted a loan under the CARES Act pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, and the loan may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges, audits, or investigations regarding qualification for the loan, any of which could reduce our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
● | Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, which could adversely affect future cash flows.

Risks Related to our Research & Development, Clinical, and Commercialization Activities
 

● | We are pursuing an IND and BLA for SkinTE, so we are an early-stage biotechnology company subject to the risks associated with such companies, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our success and viability. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our ability to timely submit an IND or BLA to the FDA may depend on circumstances outside of our control. 
● | Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement, and as a result there is significant uncertainty with respect to successful completion. 
● | Biotechnology and pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. While we have generated revenue from sales of SkinTE, we have never achieved profitable operating results in our regenerative medicine product segment, and we may never be able to do so. 
● | We are dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and the failure of such third parties to perform or delays in performance could increase our costs or prevent us from being able to use the results of the trials. 
● | If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 
● | Any adverse developments that occur during any clinical trials conducted by academic investigators or other entities conducting clinical trials under independent INDs may negatively affect the conduct of our clinical trials or our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates. 
● | Adverse side effects or other safety risks associated with our product candidates could cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials or delay or preclude approval. 
● | We may form or seek strategic alliances, enter into additional licensing arrangements, or participate in acquisition transactions in the future, and we may not succeed in realizing the benefits of such alliances, licensing arrangements, or acquisition transactions. 
● | Even if we obtain regulatory approval of SkinTE or future product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. 
● | If we are required to withdraw or we voluntarily recall a product from the market, it could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation, and disrupt our business. 
● | We face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform. 
● | We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance. 
● | We operate in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from regenerative medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors, and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do. 

Risks Related to our Operating Activities
 

● | We may be required to discontinue sales of SkinTE, which would adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have a limited history of operation with our laboratory testing service so we are unable to predict with any certainty what contribution it will make to defraying our operating expenses in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for the use of our resources to achieve our goals. 
● | Our manufacturing and COVID 19 testing operations depend primarily on one facility. If this facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing or laboratory difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could adversely affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials or perform laboratory testing services. 
● | We depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees will negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
● | The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, as well as the business or operations of third parties with whom we conduct business. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of other future health pandemics in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant business operations.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
 

● | Our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on us. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | There can be no assurance that a third party, including, but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology. 
● | We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used, or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers. 
● | If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to SkinTE or any of our product candidates, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
● | We may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages. We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain any formal legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology. 
● | We have a number of patents issued and applications pending in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, however we may not be able to enforce those patent rights against third parties. 
● | We may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock
 

● | An active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are pursuing a plan to advance regulatory approval of SkinTE, so delay or failure in achieving our milestones could adversely affect our prospects and the value of ownership of our common stock. 
● | The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may not be able to resell some or all your shares at a desired price. 
● | Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. 
● | Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law could deter a change of our management, which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us. 
● | Because we do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment. 
● | We incur costs and demands upon management because of being a public company.
