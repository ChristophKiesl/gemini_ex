Item 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.
 
AS Capital, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2006 as Jupiter Resources, Inc. On August 9, 2018, XTC, Inc., a Company owned by Chris Lotito, CEO, was awarded custodianship in a shareholder filing with the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County Nevada. On April 30, 2018 the company filed an amendment to change the name of the corporation to Rineon Group, Inc. On October 1, 2018, the company filed for a name change to AS Capital, Inc. The Company currently intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business
 
On June 4, 2019, the Company, XRC, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“XRC”) and Xue Ran Gao (“Purchaser”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase from XRC 11,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company and 964 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, for aggregate consideration of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($410,000) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA. XRC is the controlling shareholder of the Company. This acquisition closed on July 18, 2019. As a result of the purchase, the Purchaser holds a controlling interest in the Company, and may unilaterally determine the election of the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Company’s stockholders.
 
Current Business 
 
Our principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. We are in active discussions with an operating company for a potential business combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate such an acquisition or that following such acquisition we will be eligible to trade on a national securities exchange, or be quoted on the Over-the-Counter.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
 
Historical Activities
 
The Company was incorporated on June 15, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Jupiter Resources, Inc. 75,000,000 shares of stock was authorized all as Common par value $0.001, and no other classes of stock were authorized. On March 27, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ms. Helen Louise Robinson of Vernon, British Columbia, whereby she agreed to sell to us one mineral claim located approximately 30 kilometers northwest of Vernon, British Columbia in an area having the potential to contain silver or copper mineralization or deposits. In order to acquire a 100% interest in this claim, we paid $7,500 to Ms. Robinson. However, we were unable to keep the mineral claim in good standing due to lack of funding and our interest in it has lapsed.
 
On March 25, 2009, the articles were amended to authorize an addition of 10 million preferred shares making a total of 85,000,000 shares authorized (75M common, 10 preferred).
 
On April 30, 2009 the company filed an amendment to change the name of the corporation to Rineon Group, Inc. On March 30, 2009, Jupiter Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a binding letter of intent (the “Letter of Intent”) with NatProv Holdings, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Natprov”). Pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Intent, Natprov and the Company will commence the negotiation and preparation of a definitive share exchange agreement which shall contain customary representations, warranties and indemnities as agreed upon by Natprov, the Company and the shareholders of Natprov, whereby the Company, Natprov and the shareholders of Natprov will complete a share exchange transaction (the “Transaction”) on or before May 26, 2009, subject to certain conditions precedent to the closing of the Transaction.

On May 01, 2009 the Company filed a Certificate of Designation to designate 36,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, out of the 10 million preferred stock. These shares have no votes for matters brought before the common shareholders, only with matters regarding the Series A shares where they will be the only voters. They can convert into common but cannot at anytime convert to hold more than 4.95% of the issued and outstanding common shares.
 
On May 14, 2009 the Company entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement dated as of April 30, 2009 (the “Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) under which the Company sold an aggregate of 36,000 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) to Intigy Absolute Return Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Intigy”), for a purchase price of $36,000,000, or $1,000 per share of Series A $.001 Par Value Preferred Stock. In addition, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement dated as of May 14, 2009, Rineon agreed to acquire 1,985,834 shares of Amalphis from NatProv Holdings Inc (“NatProv”) for a total consideration of $36,000,000. Of the 2,437,500 shares of Amalphis held by NatProv, 1,985,834 were converted into Class A Preferred non-voting shares, which were then assigned by NatProv to Rineon. As a result, NatProv now owns 451,666 Common Shares of Amalphis, representing 100% of the voting shares of Amalphis, and Rineon owns 1,985,834 of Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares which have the same rights and privileges as the common shares except that they have a liquidation preference and no voting rights. Amalphis’ Class A Preferred Shares are not convertible into Common Shares.
 
The transactions consummated as set forth above resulted in a change of control of the Company. In connection with such change in control, on May 14, 2009 the board of directors of the Company authorized a change in the fiscal year end of the Company from May 31 to December 31.
 
Amalphis Group, Inc., (“Amalphis”) was formed in July 2008 as a British Virgin Islands (BVI) Business Company. Amalphis, through its wholly owned subsidiary Allied Provident, Inc.

In addition, the Amalphis was formed to directly sell a variety of property and casualty insurance products to businesses around the world. In September 2008, Amalphis acquired API, an entity that issues customized reinsurance to a United States insurance carrier that offers automotive insurance coverage to drivers who are unable to obtain insurance from standard carriers.
