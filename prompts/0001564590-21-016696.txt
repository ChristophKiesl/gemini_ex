 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 General
 
As of September 10, 2019, JanOne Inc. (formerly known as Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc.) and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” the “Company,” or “JanOne”) changed its name and broadened its business perspectives to being a pharmaceutical company focused on finding treatments for conditions that cause severe pain and bringing to market drugs with non-addictive pain-relieving properties. The Company aims to reduce prescriptions for dangerous opioid drugs by treating underlying diseases that cause severe pain.  Our first drug candidate is a treatment for Peripheral Arterial Disease (“PAD”), a condition that can cause severe pain and affects over 8.5 million people in the U.S. alone.  From digital technologies to educational advocacy to revolutionary painkilling drugs that address what we believe is a multibillion dollar a year market, the Company intends to champion new initiatives to help combat the opioid crisis, which claims tens of thousands of lives each year.  The new name, JanOne, was strategically chosen to express the start of a “new day” in the fight against the opioid epidemic.  January First is the first day of a New Year—a day of optimism, resolution, and hope.  JanOne affirms the Company’s new strategic commitment to fresh thinking and innovative means to assist in ending the worst drug crisis in our nation’s history.  The Company also adopted a new Nasdaq ticker symbol, NASDAQ: JAN, a new CUSIP number, 03814F403, and a new website address – www.janone.com.  
 
We continue to operate our legacy businesses, ARCA Recycling, Inc. (“ARCA Recycling”) and Customer Connexx, LLC (“Connexx”), a company that provides call center services for recycling business, in our Recycling segment, and GeoTraq Inc. (“GeoTraq”), in our Technology segment.  ARCA Recycling recycles major household appliances in North America by providing turnkey appliance recycling and replacement services for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs.  GeoTraq is engaged in the development, design, and, ultimately, we expect, the sale of cellular transceiver modules and associated wireless services.

We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1983, although, through our predecessors, we began operating our legacy recycling business in 1976.  On March 12, 2018, we reincorporated in the State of Nevada. Our principal office is located at 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 19, 2021, we, together with our subsidiaries (a) ARCA Recycling and (b) Connexx, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with (i) ARCA Affiliated Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (ii) ARCA Services Inc., a Delaware corporation, and (iii) Connexx Services Inc, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the “Buyers”), pursuant to which the Buyers agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets, and assume certain liabilities, of ARCA and Connexx (the “Disposition Transaction”).  The principal of the Buyers is Virland A. Johnson, our Chief Financial Officer.  The Disposition Transaction is expected to be consummated on or before August 18, 2021.  In the event the Disposition Transaction is not closed by such date, the Purchase Agreement may be terminated and, in accordance with its terms, the Buyers may be required to pay to us a “break fee” of $250,000.  The Purchase Agreement and the Disposition Transaction were unanimously approved by our Board of Directors at a meeting during the portion of which the Purchase Agreement and Disposition Transaction were considered and voted on while Mr. Johnson was not present.  The purchase price that the Buyers have agreed to pay to us in the Disposition Transaction is $25.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, including a potential increase in the purchase price due to an earnout, the assumption of certain debt of ARCA, Connexx, or us, and potential indemnification claims (collectively, the “Initial Aggregate Consideration”).  At closing, $7.5 million of the Aggregate Consideration will be paid in immediately available funds, and $17.5 million of the Initial Aggregate Consideration will be paid pursuant to the terms of the Buyers’ promissory note in our favor (the “Note”), which Note will bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the unpaid balance thereof.  The Buyers’ payment obligations under the Note will be subordinated to the Buyers’ obligations to their Disposition Transaction lender(s),

Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on becoming the leader in identifying, acquiring, licensing, developing, partnering, and commercializing novel, non-opioid and non-addictive therapies to address the large unmet medical need for the treatment of pain.  Our initial product candidate, JAN101 (formerly known as TV1001SR), is a potential treatment for PAD, a vascular disease that affects more than 8.5 million people in the U.S. and more than 60 million people worldwide. We expect to commence Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of PAD in 2021. We are also researching the potential impact our compound JAN101 could have in patients with COVID-19 as many doctors around the world and our company believes COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that directly affects the vascular system. In March 2021, we determined to defer our current, on-going pursuit of JAN101 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 vascular complications.  In connection with that determination, we will not currently file a utility patent nor submit an investigational new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA.  This determination was based on several factors, including the current, positive effect that three vaccines are having on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Should the vaccines ultimately prove less effective than currently expected or should new COVID-19 variants result in another pandemic, we may then determine to end our deferral of pursuing JAN101 as a treatment of COVID-19 vascular complications.

JAN101 
 
Generally
 
JAN101, formerly known as TV1001SR, our advanced product candidate, is a patented oral, sustained release pharmaceutical composition of sodium nitrite and targets poor blood flow to the extremities, such as those with vascular complications of diabetes or PAD and treats pain. A conclusion from a round of human studies found JAN101 prevents the prevalent reports of headaches by patients treated with an immediate release formulation of sodium nitrite. In a previous study of patients with PAD, 40 mg BID treatment with immediate release sodium nitrite led to a statistically significant reduction in reported pain while a 80 mg BID treatment had the more pronounced effect on bioactivity and Flow Mediated Dilation, a measure of vascular function.  However, a number of subjects on both treatment groups reported headaches and dizziness following treatment.  Although this did not result in subjects discontinuing treatment, JAN101 was developed to overcome this side effect.  JAN101 was tested in a bridging study of diabetic neuropathy subjects and during that bridging study, the subjects did not report headaches or dizziness. Subjects in this bridging study also reported less pain following treatment and improvements in bioactivity (quantitative sensory testing, a measure of nerve function) were similar to the PAD study, where the 80 mg dose group had the greatest improvement in Flow Mediated Dilation. The ability to alleviate pain with BID treatment of JAN101 offers promise for a new non-addictive, non-sedating treatment of chronic pain.

Benefits of Sodium Nitrite on Vascular Health
 
In initial research studies, sodium nitrite effectively restored ischemic tissue blood flow and was effective in a wide range of pathologies involving alterations of angiogenesis - development of new blood vessels - including diabetes, wound healing and tissue necrosis. Beneficial effects included enhancing angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation, and arteriogenesis.  There is also a strong association between reduced circulating nitrite levels and cardiovascular diseases in humans.  We describe some of the associations and beneficial effects of sodium nitrite/nitrite below.
 
Plasma nitrite levels are negatively correlated to cardiovascular disease
 

3

Plasma nitrite levels were inversely related to number of cardiovascular risk factors a subject had and decreased plasma nitrite was associated with decreased flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) and increased intimal medial thickness (IMT) (both indicators of vascular pathology). -Kleinbongard, et al. (2006) Free Radic Biol and Medicine 40:295-302.
 
Plasma nitrite levels are reduced in diabetic and PAD patients    
 

Exercise is a well-known stimulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, NO production that leads to increased plasma nitrite. In the study by Allen et al, these authors revealed that baseline plasma levels of nitrite were less in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or DM + PAD. Importantly, increases in plasma nitrite levels were not observed in either DM, PAD or DM + PAD patients after supervised exercise. These data reveal that baseline nitrite availability is compromised in DM patients and that supervised exercise is unable to increase plasma nitrite levels but actually results in a decrease in nitrite highlighting a physiological efficiency of this molecule. -Allen et al Nitric Oxide 2009 20:231-237.
 
Skeletal Muscle Nitrite and Metabolite Levels are Reduced in Critical Limb Ischemia Patients
 

4

Skeletal muscle nitrite, nitrosothiol, nitric oxide-heme and cGMP are all significantly reduced in CLI patients. Diabetic patients with CLI show even further nitrite reductions.
 
In summary, nitrite levels in various cardiovascular and vascular diseases appear to be inversely related to the severity of the disease in humans:
 
 
• | Lower nitrite levels are associated with higher level of heart failure;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower nitrite levels are observed in diabetic patients with PAD and are not compensated by exercise; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nitrite levels are lower in the muscles of patients with critical limb ischemia and are further reduced in diabetic subjects with critical limb ischemia.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Given the association between low levels of circulating nitrite and human diseases, supplementation with sodium nitrite has been studied preclinically in animals.   Below are summaries of some of the more important findings:
 
 
• | Promotes angiogenesis
--+----------------------


• | Stimulates wound healing
--+-------------------------


• | Prevents tissue necrosis

Nitrite Therapy Selectively Increases Ischemic Tissue Vascular Density in a NO-dependent Manner
 

Chronic sodium nitrite therapy increases ischemic tissue vascular density in a NO-dependent manner. A and B show representative images of CD31 (red) and DAPI nuclear (blue) staining from sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate ischemic gastrocnemius muscle tissue at day 7. C and D report the vascular density of ischemic gastrocnemius muscle tissue at days 3 and 7 for 165 μg/kg sodium nitrite and nitrate treatments, respectively. E and F demonstrate the vascular density of ischemic gastrocnemius muscle tissue at days 3 and 7 from 165 μg/kg sodium nitrite plus carboxy PTIO. (Scale bar, 150 μm.) n = 10 mice per treatment group. Kumar D. et al. PNAS; 2008; 105:7540-7545.

Nitrite Therapy Augments Arterial Perfusion of Ischemic Tissue
 


Chronic sodium nitrite therapy acutely increases ischemic tissue blood flow and stimulates arteriogenesis. A and B report 165 μg/kg sodium nitrite-induced acute changes in blood flow of chronically ischemic tissues at various time points with or without cPTIO, respectively. C reports the number of arterial branches between PBS and nitrite therapies. D and E illustrate vascular casting of the arterial vasculature in ischemic hind limbs of day 7 nitrite or PBS-treated mice, respectively. *, P < 0.01 vs. sodium nitrate. n = 10 mice per treatment group. Kumar D. et.al. PNAS;2008; 105:7540-7545.

Nitrite Therapy Restores Diabetic Ischemic Hind-Limb Blood Flow and Promotes Wound Heal
 

Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed on 18-20 week old male Db/Db mice. Mice were randomized to PBS or sodium nitrite (165 μg/kg) therapy twice daily via I.P. injection. Laser doppler flowmetry was performed at the indicated time points. Increased wound dehiscence was noted in the PBS treated animals at day 7 but not in nitrite treated animals. (Bir et al Diabetes 2014, 63(1):270-81).
Nitrite Therapy Increases Diabetic Ischemia Induced Angiogenesis
 

8

Nitrite therapy prevented ischemia mediated endothelial cell density loss in normal C57BL/6J ischemic limbs. Nitrite therapy significantly restored endothelial cell density in ischemic limbs of diabetic mice to normal C57BL/6J levels compared to PBS therapy of non-ischemic and ischemic conditions. These data suggest that nitrite therapy may be useful in attenuating microvascular rarefaction due to loss of nitric oxide that is observed during metabolic dysfunction (Frisbee JC AJP Integr Comp Physiol 2005 289(2):R307-16; Stepp et al Microcirculation 2007 14(4-5): 311-6).
Delayed Nitrite Therapy Restores Ischemic Hind-Limb Blood Flow
 

Studies were performed to determine whether nitrite mediated therapy would be effective in tissue that had been left ischemic for 5 days after femoral artery ligation. Femoral artery ligation was performed in C57BL/6J mice and the animals randomized to either PBS or sodium nitrite therapy 5 days after artery ligation. Treatments were given b.i.d. via I.P. injection. Ischemic limb blood flow was measured using laser doppler flowmetry. (Bir et al Diabetes 2014, 63(1):270-81).

Delayed nitrite therapy increases SPY angiogram arteriogenesis
 

Delayed nitrite therapy increases SPY angiogram arteriogenesis. Representative temporal SPY angiogram image stills (3–6s) are shown at 11 days following ligation and 6 days after beginning therapy (either PBS or sodium nitrite). Left: PBS control angiogram. Right: sodium nitrite angiogram following injection of ICG. n = 5 animals per cohort. Circles identify limb anatomical regions of vascular blush, whereas arrows indicate perfused vessels that progressively occur over time.

Nitrite Therapy Prevents Tissue Necrosis in Aged Db/Db Mice
 

Delayed sodium nitrite (165 ug/kg) or control PBS therapy was stated 5 days post femoral artery ligation in 9 month old Db/Db mice. Nitrite therapy significantly prevented tissue necrosis (panel B) compared to control PBS therapy (panel A). Panel D reports tissue necrosis severity as a function of degree of limb and digit involvement. Nitrite therapy but not PBS control or sodium nitrate significantly prevented tissue necrosis. (Bir et al Diabetes 2014, 63(1):270-81).
Nitrite and Hind Limb Ischemia Summary
 
Sodium nitrite has long been known to be a potent vasodilator (transiently increasing blood vessel diameter) that can lead to a drop in blood pressure when given acutely.  The above studies indicate that chronic administration at low doses, promotes angiogenesis, unlike single one-time nitrite therapy which does not stimulate angiogenesis. In addition, these studies and a large number of other studies not reviewed above, show:

• | Nitrite therapy is very specific, acting only in damaged, ischemic tissue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delayed nitrite therapy effectively restores ischemic tissue blood flow;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nitrite therapy is effective in a wide range of pathologies involving alterations of angiogenesis including critical limb ischemia, heart failure, and tissue necrosis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nitrite supplementation has had positive effects in various diabetes models, including diabetic nephropathy and diabetic wound healing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beneficial effects center on enhancing angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation, and arteriogenesis; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustained release nitrite therapy, unlike immediate release therapy, does not lead to vasodilation or a drop in blood pressure.

Our Product Candidate JAN101
 
Our product candidate is designed to treat diseases associated with poor vascular function. The following table summarizes our current product candidate pipeline:
 

Therapeutic Area Peripheral Artery Disease Pain COVID-19 Drug JAN101 Pre-IND Phase 1 Phase 2a Phase 2b Phase 
 In March 2021, we determined to defer our current, on-going pursuit of JAN101 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 vascular complications.  In connection with that determination, we will not currently file a utility patent nor submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA.  This determination was based on several factors, including the current, positive effect that three vaccines are having on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Should the vaccines ultimately prove less effective than currently expected or should new COVID-19 variants result in another pandemic, we may then determine to end our deferral of pursuing JAN101 as a treatment of COVID-19 vascular complications.
Pain
 
Pain is a protective reaction that alerts the body to the presence of actual or potential tissue damage so that necessary corrective responses can be mounted. The National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) defines chronic pain as pain that persists beyond the normal healing time of an injury or that persists longer than three months. It is estimated that chronic pain affects 100 million individuals in the US and over 1.5 billion people worldwide, thus more people suffer from chronic pain than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined (Cowen Therapeutic Categories Outlook March 2019). Chronic pain exacts a tremendous cost in terms of direct treatment and rehabilitation expenditures, lost worker productivity, prevalent addiction to opioid-based drugs, and emotional and financial burden for patients and their families. According to an Institute of Medicine of the National Academies report, pain is a significant public health problem in the United States that costs society between $560 billion and $635 billion annually. Despite the magnitude of the pain problem, innovation in the development of therapeutic solutions has been largely absent. Since 2010, there have been 20 approvals by the FDA for the treatment of pain, of which 12 were opioid variants, one was an extended release generic corticosteroid, five were variants of aspirin, and two were variants of other existing drugs. We are developing a novel product candidate designed to overcome the limitations of current treatment options for patients with PAD who suffer from chronic pain. According to a research study by Stanford University more than 24% of patients with PAD are at risk of high opioid use. By treating pain at the source and present patients and physicians with better and safer treatment alternatives we expect to minimize opioids at the prescription pad.  Given the properties of JAN101, we have made the strategic decision to initially focus on pain associated with PAD by treating the underlying cause of PAD.
 
Peripheral artery disease 
 
Peripheral artery disease is a general term for conditions in which arterial blood flow to the limbs are partially blocked. When there is less blood present in the extremities relative to demand, muscle pain and fatigue result, especially in the calf, which is also known as intermittent claudication.  In many patients, pain and fatigue are relieved through rest. Roughly half of patients with PAD are asymptomatic. The most common cause of PAD / intermittent claudication is atherosclerosis. Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and smoking are all risk factors which can increase the likelihood of PAD. In atherosclerosis, fat deposits (plaques) build up along arterial walls, resulting in a reduction in blood flow in the legs. This same process can cause strokes if the arteries leading up to the brain are affected.
 
12

Because of the high rate of asymptomatic patients, prevalence figures vary widely. Some estimate that up to 200 million worldwide have PAD, ranging from asymptomatic disease to severe. Prevalence increases as a function of patient age, rising sharply after the age of 60. Thus, in countries with an aging population, it is expected that the prevalence of PAD will only increase.  There is also a strong ethnic and racial component to PAD prevalence, which may be due to cultural differences in diet and exercise, along with genetic differences. Some suggest a prevalence of 8-12 million in the US alone, with roughly a third experiencing pain when walking, which improves upon resting. The diagnosis of PAD usually begins with patient complaints of pain in the extremities. If the patient is already being treated or monitored for diabetes or other risk factors, then the physician will check for a weak or absent pulse in the extremity. Decreased blood pressure, poor wound healing, and whooshing sounds in the legs (via stethoscope) are also tell-tale signs of PAD / intermittent claudication. Angiograms, electrocardiograms, and ultrasounds can also be used to image and confirm the diagnosis.
 

The non-drug treatment of PAD / intermittent claudication may be divided into four general categories:
 
 
• | Lifestyle – Primarily changes in diet and smoking cessation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exercise – Patients who walk, cycle, stretch, or swim can experience marked improvement. Formal programs involving treadmills and track walking (usually 3-5 times per week) are frequently provided to patients. However, if the pain is triggered by exercise (claudication) and is significant, it can discourage the patient from exercise.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Angioplasty – A procedure by which the affected artery is stretched with a balloon-like device. This procedure has limited effectiveness and is reserved for severely blocked arteries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bypass Surgery – Arteries which are beyond angioplasty can be bypassed entirely. This procedure is typically reserved for cases where the blockage is considered very long (~10 centimeters) and nearly complete.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The underlying condition, however, is not addressed by surgery. Surgical approaches will not, in the long run, improve exercise capacity and walking distance. Only exercise itself, coupled with lifestyle changes and drug approaches, has this benefit.
 
13

Prescription drugs for the treatment of the underlying PAD may be divided into multiple categories, depending on the underlying condition and severity:
 
 
• | Cholesterol-Lowering Agents - Statins and bile acid sequestrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antiplatelet Medica1ons – Aspirin and related drugs, such as clopidogrel. Cilostazol also has antiplatelet properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antihypertensives – Patients with underlying high blood pressure can and will receive any number of medications to reduce blood pressure, such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diabetes Therapies – While a substantial portion of PAD patients may have pre-diabetes or fulminant diabetes, it is unknown if aggressive treatment of diabetes has a positive effect on PAD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pain – To our knowledge, no drugs are specifically indicated for PAD-associated pain. Pentoxifylline, for example, is indicated “…for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication on the basis of chronic occlusive arterial disease of the limbs.” (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, 2010) However, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of pentoxifylline is mixed. Short-term courses of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen may be used, provided the patient is not on another anticoagulant like aspirin. Non-drug pain relievers, such as TENS and massage therapy, may also be used in these patients. Opioids may also be used which creates a risk for addiction and potential misuse at the medicine cabinet by family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The lack of any truly effective treatment of PAD, along with encouraging early trial results using JAN101 on both improving vascular function and reducing pain in PAD patients, has created an opportunity to potentially treat this large unmet medical need.  By improving vascular function, JAN101 has the potential to reduce associated pain and improve PAD patients’ quality of life.

COVID-19
 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a recently discovered coronavirus.
 Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. 
 
One of the hallmarks of severe cases of COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”), a rapid, widespread inflammation of the lungs that can lead to respiratory failure and death.  In addition to the widely reported lung injuries associated with COVID-19, clinicians around the world are reporting that the disease also could be causing cardiac injuries in patients that sometimes lead to cardiac arrest. Kidney damage also is becoming a commonly reported issue among COVID-19 patients.
 
A study in the May, 28 2020 in the New England Journal published research detailing the post-mortem features of seven patients who died of COVID-19 provides critical insights, including evidence of extensive damage to the lining of the blood vessels, abnormal blood vessel growth in the lungs and widespread blood clotting. The study led by Steven Mentzer, HMS professor of surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and done in collaboration with a team of international researchers showed that infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, caused severe damage to the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and triggered widespread blood clotting.  The team also identified signs of a distinctive pattern of vascular disease progression in some cases of COVID-19 compared with patterns seen in equally severe influenza virus infection. The findings highlight these key takeaways:
 
 
• | While caused by a respiratory virus, COVID-19 manifests as a vascular disease that leads to severe injuries to blood vessels throughout the lungs. The damage to vascular cells may help explain why serious blood clotting has been observed in many patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The substantial new blood vessel growth seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients occurs primarily through a mechanism known as intussusceptive angiogenesis—the splitting of existing blood vessels to form new ones—perhaps as a repair response to blood clotting and blood vessel damage, according to the authors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Damaged blood vessels may also underlie other problems, such as COVID toe, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), stroke and other seemingly unrelated problems seen with COVID-19.
 
In March 2021, we determined to defer our current, on-going pursuit of JAN101 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 vascular complications.  In connection with that determination, we will not currently file a utility patent nor submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA.  This determination was based on several factors, including the current, positive effect that three vaccines are having on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Should the vaccines ultimately prove less effective than currently expected or should new COVID-19 variants result in another pandemic, we may then determine to end our deferral of pursuing JAN101 as a treatment of COVID-19 vascular complications.

Our Strategy
 
Our mission is to develop and commercialize novel, non-opioid, and non-addictive therapies to safely and effectively address the significant unmet medical need of chronic pain or treat conditions that cause pain. The principal elements of our strategy to achieve this mission are the following:

• | License, acquire, develop, and create novel, non-opioid and non-addictive therapies by leveraging our understanding of pain biology to address the large and growing problem of pain. While innovation in medical sciences has led to exciting new treatment options in many disease areas, pain has seen limited innovation in recent years. We have a deep understanding of the pathophysiology of pain and diseases that cause pain. We intend to leverage this understanding to bring innovation in the pain treatment paradigm through targeted acquisitions of companies or assets in development. Our advisors and doctors have years of collective experience in leadership positions at institutions and substantial scientific experience and understand the complexity of designing and executing clinical trials for and developing therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance the development of our lead product candidate, JAN101, designed for the treatment of patients with PAD and pain associated with the disease. There are limited therapeutic options available for patients with PAD and we believe that JAN101 has the potential to transform the standard of care to a twice a day pill to substantially improve moderate to severe PAD. The company plans to engage a contract research organization (“CRO”) in early 2021 and begin enrolling subjects for the first Phase 2b trials for JAN101, and we expect to report topline results promptly following receipt of the data from the CRO.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage clinical activity of JAN101 to possibly expand into new indications, including complications associated with COVID-19We believe that JAN101 may have utility in treating vascular complications in patients with COVID-19 as we believe COVID-19 is an endothelial cell disease which manifests its complications in the vascular system and major organ causing complications in recovered patients. In November 2020, we filed an investigational new drug application for our COVID-19 indication (which was subsequently converted to a pre-IND). In March 2021, we determined to defer our current, on-going pursuit of JAN101 as a potential treatment for COVID-19 vascular complications. In connection with that determination, we will not currently file a utility patent nor submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA. This determination was based on several factors, including the current, positive effect that three vaccines are having on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Should the vaccines ultimately prove less effective than currently expected or should new COVID-19 variants result in another pandemic, we may then determine to end our deferral of pursuing JAN101 as a treatment of COVID-19 vascular complications.

• | Advance our product candidates through clinical development and pursue development of additional product candidates through acquisitions. Our objective is to build a well-balanced, multi-asset portfolio targeting the large population of patients with chronic and acute pain. To achieve this, in addition to JAN101, we intend to pursue partnerships, licensing agreements, and potential acquisitions of other pharma companies. We continue our search for assets with indications where we believe they could have meaningful impact and address the large unmet medical need. In addition, we may choose to selectively in-license or acquire complementary product candidates by leveraging the insights, network, and experience of our team.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the commercial potential of all our product candidates. We currently intend to retain all commercial rights to JAN101 in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States. Because we believe that PAD is an attractive market for many major pharmaceutical companies, we may sub-license or partner certain indications if we believe it may enhance stockholder value. As we continue to build and develop our product portfolio, we may opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our pipeline while seeking to develop other indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our management team background and expertise. We have assembled a team with extensive experience described above.

Chronic Pain
 
The NIH defines chronic pain as pain that persists either beyond the normal healing time of an injury or longer than three months. We believe that chronic pain represents a significant public health crisis. In the United States, chronic pain affects approximately 40 million adults annually, which is greater than the annual prevalence of each of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. It is also estimated that pain leads to between $560 and $635 billion in healthcare and lost productivity costs each year. Chronic pain is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States, and approximately 23 million adults in the United States experience severe pain over a three-month period. Globally the prevalence of chronic pain is even larger, with over 1 billion people worldwide affected each year. Common types of chronic pain include those of neuropathic and inflammatory origin and may involve the skin, muscles, joints, bones, tendons, ligaments, and other soft tissues. Chronic pain is associated with a variety of clinical conditions including, but not limited to, arthritis, spinal conditions, cancer, fibromyalgia, diabetes, surgical recovery, visceral injury and general trauma.
 
Pain is a necessary protective reaction that alerts the body to the presence of actual or potential tissue damage so that necessary corrective responses can be mounted. Pain is signaled by specialized cells in the peripheral nervous system called nociceptors, or pain-sensing fibers. These pain-sensing fibers normally transmit information about stimuli that approach or exceed harmful intensity from different locations in the body to the brain, which registers this information as a sensation of pain. In the case of tissue injury due to trauma or infection, pain accompanies the associated inflammation, persists for the duration of the inflammatory response, and aids healing by inhibiting use of the affected body part.
 
Pain also can modify the central nervous system such that the brain becomes sensitized and registers more pain with less provocation. This is called central sensitization. When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called wind-up and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity. This persistent, or up-regulated, state of reactivity lowers the threshold for what triggers the sensation of pain and can result in the sensation of pain even after the initial injury might have healed.
 
When there is dysfunction in pain signaling, injury to the nervous system, or an unhealed injury, pain becomes no longer just a symptom, but a disease in itself.
 
Current Therapeutic Approaches to Treating Chronic Pain and Their Limitations
 
NSAIDs
 
Some of the most widely used therapies to treat chronic inflammatory pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. NSAIDs can have significant side effects that include gastrointestinal bleeding, gastritis, high blood pressure, fluid retention, kidney problems, heart problems and rashes. On April 7, 2005, the FDA announced a decision to require boxed warnings of potential cardiovascular risk for all NSAIDs.
 18


Corticosteroids
 
Corticosteroids, or steroids, also possess anti-inflammatory properties and are commonly used in the practice of pain management, either systemically or locally, depending on the condition. Steroids work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. While steroids are commonly used, they may have numerous and serious side effects. These side effects may include allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk for infection, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes or decreased glucose tolerance, hypertension, loss of bone density, and loss of joint cartilage volume. In addition, steroids should not be administered when there is an infection present because steroids can inhibit the body’s natural infection-fighting immune response. Also, if a joint is already damaged or is subject to chronic deterioration, intra-articular, or IA steroid injections are not likely to provide any long-term restorative benefit. For the above reasons, IA steroid injections are generally recommended to be administered no more often than every six weeks and not more than three to four times per year.
Opioids
 
Opioids are some of the most widely prescribed therapeutics for chronic and acute pain, and sales of these drugs have quadrupled between 1999 and 2010. According to a National Survey on Drug Use and Health report, in 2016 more than one third of adult Americans were prescribed opioids and 230 million opioid prescriptions were written that year in the United States. Opioids act by binding to specific receptors located on neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous system throughout the body including in the brain, spinal cord and other nervous tissue. Although they can be effective in providing pain relief, the increased medical use of opioids has been accompanied by an increase in the abuse and misuse of prescription opioids. In addition, for most patients, chronic opioid use is a poor option due to an intolerance to the many side effects, including nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and constipation, and the propensity for opioids to become less effective with long-term use. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, almost two million individuals abused or were dependent on prescription opioids in 2014. CDC figures show that the number of opioid-related overdose deaths has quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, and currently approximately 40% of opioid overdose deaths in the United States involve a prescription opioid. This increase in prescription opioid-related deaths in the United States prompted former President Trump to declare the opioid crisis a national Public Health Emergency in October 2017. Opioid abuse has become an epidemic in the United States, ranking as the nation’s second most prevalent illegal drug problem. These major issues create the need to find new approaches to treating chronic pain.
Our Approach to Treating PAD and Chronic Pain
 
The unmet medical need for treating PAD and chronic pain reflects the historic failure to develop novel classes of analgesics with comparable or greater efficacy, an acceptable level of adverse effects and a lower abuse liability than those currently available. Some of the reasons for this include the heterogeneity of chronic pain and its related conditions, and the complexity and diversity of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for pain. However, recent advances in the understanding of the neurobiology of pain are beginning to offer opportunities to identify new drug targets and develop new therapeutic strategies.
 
We have taken an innovative and targeted approach to identifying treatments for chronic pain that leverages our understanding of the pathophysiology of pain. Pain is variable—for example, it can be inflammatory or neuropathic in nature, and it may be localized to a specific area of the body or it may be generalized throughout. We believe that the most effective way to treat chronic pain is through therapies that specifically target the origin of the pain signal. We strive to maximize each of our product candidate’s potential based on its unique mechanism of action related to the origin of the pain signal.

A Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Effects of a Sustained Release Formulation of Sodium Nitrite (SR-nitrite) on Patients with Diabetic Neuropathy
 
Background: Background: Sodium nitrite has been reported to be effective in reducing chronic peripheral pain.
 
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 40 and 80 mg, BID, of an oral sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite (SR-nitrite) in patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy, and to determine whether SR-nitrite would reduce the frequency of headaches reported previously by subjects receiving the same doses of an immediate release formulation. Study Design: Phase II, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. Setting: The Ohio Pain Clinic and Kettering Medical Center.
Methods: Twenty-four patients were randomized to 40 mg or 80 mg SR-nitrite or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to determine whether headaches would be reduced using SR-nitrite. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the change of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) pain score from baseline to that reported after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline for the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Scale, the RAND 36 questionnaire, Short Form McGill Questionnaire, daily patient reported score for neuropathic pain, changes in HbA1c, PulseOx and quantitative sensory testing. Results: The number of subjects reporting adverse events and the number of adverse events did not change with dose. There were no reports of treatment-related headaches. Although no significant differences were identified in patient responses to the questionnaires, a trend was observed. In the NPSI assessment, patients in the 40 mg and 80 mg dose group reported a 12.7% and 22.0% reduction in pain, respectively, compared to an 8.4% reduction by patients in the placebo group. A trend was also observed with the BPI total severity score. However, the 40 mg dosing group reported the greatest reduction in pain using the McGill Pain index and via patient logs of daily pain scores, where the mean of pain scores reported by subjects in the 40 mg group dropped by day 41 and generally stayed lower than the mean of scores reported by subjects in either of the other two groups. Patients in the 80 mg SR-nitrite group had an improvement in both Nerve Sensory Conductance and Nerve Sensory Velocity. No changes were observed in HbA1c levels or PulseOx.
Limitations: Small sample size.
 
Conclusion: Sustained release sodium nitrite prevents the prevalent reports of headaches by patients treated with an immediate release formulation of sodium nitrite. In a previous study of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), 40 mg BID treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in reported pain, similar trends were observed at the end of the trial period for most of the pain questionnaires used in the study. The 80 mg BID treatment had the more pronounced affect on bioactivity (quantitative sensory testing), which was similar to the PAD study, where this dose group had the greatest improvement in FMD {AU: spell out FMD}. The ability to alleviate pain with BID treatment of SR-nitrite offers promise for a new non-addictive, non-sedating treatment of chronic pain and warrants further study.
 
Microcirculatory injury, which is common in diabetic patients, can lead to a number of problems. Prominent among these is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) (1,2). About 10% of patients will have evidence of DPN at the time they are initially evaluated, and almost 50% of diabetic patients will ultimately develop DPN. Of diabetic patients with DPN, 40% to 50% suffer from chronic pain as well as paresthesias, sensory loss, and weakness, and have at least an 8-fold increased risk of undergoing a distal lower extremity amputation compared to similar non-diabetics.  Endothelial cells play an important part in the regulation of microcirculation, as they maintain vascular tone by secreting both vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. A central feature of diabetic microvascular disease (MVD) is endothelial dysfunction, which, in turn, plays an important role in the development and progression of DPN. The pathophysiological factors leading to endothelial dysfunction in diabetes include chronic hyperglycemia and protein glycolation, insulin resistance, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress. Studies have now shown a close relationship between endothelial dysfunction and diminished nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Endogenously produced NO has a half life measured in seconds, and is rapidly oxidized to nitrite (NO2–) and nitrate (NO3––) end products, the latter of which is biologically inert. In the presence of microcirculatory ischemia and endothelial cell dysfunction, however, endogenous NO production by eNOS is much more limited. In such circumstances, circulating NO2– can be non-enzymatically reduced to increase NO availability. In addition to serving as a circulating NO reservoir, nitrite itself has also been shown to have direct and potent vasodilatory effects in vitro and in vivo. The findings that NO2– mediates vasodilatation, both directly and through NO generation, has led to 
 20

growing interest in the potential effectiveness of nitrite as a therapeutic agent in conditions associated with DPN and endothelial dysfunction. Such conditions include diabetic microvascular disease, DPN, and retinopathy, in which low levels of NO and NO2–, as well as elevated levels of nitrate (NO3), suggest that the complete oxidation of NO occurs during diabetes with insufficient NO2– reserves to restore NO bioavailability. Previous human studies with an oral formulation of NaNO2 have shown that administration twice daily improves vascular function. In the peripheral arterial disease study, subjects who received the lower dose of NaNO2 reported a significant reduction in pain. Although side effects were minimal, headaches and dizziness were reported by a large number of subjects, likely due to the rapid release of NaNO2 leading to vasodilation. An oral sustained-release formulation of NaNO2 (SR-nitrite) was developed in an attempt to overcome these problems and was tested in a porcine model of metabolic syndrome with critical limb ischemia. SR-nitrite-treated animals showed increased myocardial NO bioavailability, diminished oxidative stress, and cytoprotection in ischemic tissue. Importantly, 24-telometry recordings of blood pressure showed no evidence of vasodilation. In the above study, we hypothesized that the SRnitrite would reduce or eliminate headaches reported in patients following administration of the immediate release formulation. Given the promising results on reducing pain in diabetic patients with peripheral arterial disease reported in the previous study, patients with diabetic neuropathy were utilized in this study to determine whether any trends in reducing pain could be observed. The study design was a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind phase II study was carried out to investigate the safety and potential biological activity of multiple doses of an oral, sustained-release formulation of sodium nitrite (SR-nitrite; Theravasc Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), BID in doses of 40 mg and 80 mg over a 12-week treatment period, in human subjects with diabetes and neuropathic pain in the lower extremities and feet. The trial was approved by the Copernicus institutional review board and listed on ClinicalTrials.gov: www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02412852. The study was funded by Theravasc Inc.
 
JAN101—Regulatory Strategy
 
Sodium Nitrite has been previously approved as one of the active components of cyanide poisoning antidote. This means the approval path for JAN101 is through a 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”), which we intend to pursue.
JAN101—Commercial Strategy
 
We currently intend to use third party providers and manufacturers to effectively support the commercialization JAN101, if we are successful in obtaining FDA approval.  We believe that we can cost effectively promote JAN101 to the patients suffering from PAD. We anticipate our commercial operation to include outside sales management, outside sales support, distribution support and an internal marketing group. Additional requisite capabilities will include focused management of key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and government accounts.  We intend to selectively partner with third parties with vast experience in the space as we have been partnering for every aspect of development. 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive research and development efforts, rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We are currently focused on the development and commercialization of our asset pipeline of novel, non-opioid and non-addictive therapies for PAD. The number of patients suffering from chronic PAD is large and growing. While we believe that our product candidate and our Chief Scientific Officers development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies either marketing or developing therapeutics to treat chronic pain. Academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies.  Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, robust drug pipelines, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified clinical, regulatory, scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.  The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
21

Significant competition exists in the PAD pain field. Although we believe our approach to developing novel treatments for pain is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies, such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids and opioids, we will need to compete with all currently available and future therapies within the indications where our development is focused.  With respect to JAN101, the main classes of marketed products that are available for the treatment of PAD pain include NSAIDs and opioids. Furthermore, numerous monoclonal antibodies targeting nerve growth factor, or NGF inhibitors, are in clinical development, including two product candidates in Phase 3.
 There are a number of companies developing or marketing therapies for the treatment and management of pain that may compete with our current product candidate, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others. We endeavor to protect our products using a combination of intellectual property protections and available government regulatory and marketing exclusivities afforded to new medicines. For example, we endeavor to protect our products by, among other methods, filing U.S., and potentially in the future, foreign, patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also use other forms of protection, such as confidential information, trade secrets and know-how, and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
 
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend intellectual property rights, and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business.
 
Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, we have developed methods for the more efficient manufacture of sustained released sodium nitrite tablets. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners.
License Agreement
 
On November 19, 2019, we entered into a Patent and Know How License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with UAB Research Foundation (“UABRF”), TheraVasc, Inc. (“TheraVasc”), and the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, acting on behalf of LSU Health Sciences Center at Shreveport (“LSU Health Shreveport”, together with UABRF and TheraVasc, the “Licensors”). Under the License Agreement, the Licensors have agreed to grant to JanOne an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the Licensors’ patent rights and know-how related to the Licensors’ sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite.  Under the License Agreement, we have agreed to pay a non-refundable upfront license fee and certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones of up to approximately $6.5 million and certain royalty payments and annual license maintenance fees.  The License Agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize JAN101.

Commercial Operations
 
We currently have no marketing and sales organization. We have retained global rights to our product candidate, and, if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA to market in the United States we expect that our sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an outside marketing group and distribution support. We intend to invest in our commercial capabilities prudently by focusing our marketing efforts on the physician subspecialties that treat patients with PAD. These physicians include, but are not limited to, pain management specialists, rheumatologist, surgeons and sports medicine physicians. We will also evaluate licensing and partnering with third parties to help us reach other sales channels and geographic markets inside and outside of the United States.
Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies, and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
 
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional research board, or IBR, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23

 
• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA and approval of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies
 
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials, due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials, or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. The information contained in, or accessible through, this website does not constitute a part of this prospectus. We have included this website address in this prospectus solely as an inactive textual reference.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
 
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
24

The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and non-clinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 
United States Review and Approval Process
 
The results of product development, pre-clinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
25

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 
To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
26

The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 
Moreover, under the provisions of the FDASIA, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user program fee requirements for any marketed products.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
27

Once an approval of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
 
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added two pathways for FDA drug approval. First, the Hatch-Waxman amendments authorized the FDA to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the data owner. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that acts as the “listed drug.” The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Second, the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA also established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are referred to as “listed drugs”). An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include pre-clinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. For some drugs, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate and/or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not bioequivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition.
 
28

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
 
Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.  Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any therapeutic product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
 
29

The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.
 
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (i) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (ii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iii) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (iv) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; (v) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (vi) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (vii) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, former President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
 
 
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which among other things requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, and biologics, that are reimbursable by a federal healthcare program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar federal laws and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation Outside the United States
 
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
In order to market our future products in the EEA and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 
 
• | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. In Japan, medicinal products approved for administration to a patient via a new route of administration qualify for six years of market exclusivity.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 
Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an IEC. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply.
 Recycling
 We started our business in 1976 as a used appliance retailer that reconditioned old appliances to sell in our stores.  Under contracts with national and regional retailers of new appliances, we collected the replaced appliance from the retailer’s customer’s residence when one of their stores delivered a new appliance. Any old appliances that we could not sell in our stores were sold to scrap metal processors. In the late 1980s, stricter environmental regulations began to affect the disposal of unwanted appliances and we were no longer able to take appliances that contained hazardous components to a scrap metal processor. At that time, we began to develop systems and equipment to remove the harmful materials so that metal processors would accept the appliance shells for processing. We then offered our services for disposing of appliances in an environmentally sound manner to appliance manufacturers and retailers, waste hauling companies, rental property managers, local governments, and the public.  In 1989, we began contracting with electric utility companies to provide turnkey appliance recycling services to support their energy conservation efforts. Since that time, we have provided our services to approximately 400 utilities and other providers of energy efficiency programs throughout North America.
 32

We currently have contracts to recycle, or to replace and recycle, major household appliances for approximately 180 utilities across North America.  We operate 17 recycling centers in the U.S. and Canada to process and recycle old appliances according to all federal, state, provincial, and local rules and regulations. We use U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) Responsible Appliance Disposal (“RAD”) Program-compliant methods to remove and properly manage hazardous components and materials, including CFC refrigerants, mercury, polyurethane foam insulation and recyclable materials, such as ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics, and glass. All of our facilities comply with licensing and permitting requirements, and employees who process appliances receive extensive safety and hazardous materials training.
 Major household appliances in the United States include:
 
 
Refrigerators | Clothes washers 
----------------+----------------------
Freezers | Clothes dryers 
Ranges/ovens | Room air conditioners
Dishwashers | Dehumidifiers 
Microwave ovens | Humidifiers 

 
Improper disposal of old appliances threatens air, ground, and water resources because many types of major appliances contain substances that can damage the environment. These harmful materials include:
  
1. | Mercury, which easily enters the body through absorption, inhalation, or ingestion, potentially causing neurological damage. Mercury-containing components may be found in older freezers, washers, and ranges.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Chlorofluorocarbon (“CFC”), hydrochlorofluorocarbon, and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (collectively, “Refrigerants”), which cause long-term damage to the earth’s ozone layer and may contribute to global climate change. Refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners, and dehumidifiers commonly contain Refrigerants. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | CFCs, having a very high ozone-depletion potential that may also be used as blowing agents in the polyurethane foam insulation of refrigerators and freezers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Other materials, such as oil, that are harmful when released into the environment.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The U.S. federal government requires the recovery of refrigerants upon appliance disposal and also regulates the management of hazardous materials found in appliances. Most state and local governments have also enacted laws affecting how their residents dispose of unwanted appliances. For example, many areas restrict landfills and scrap metal processors from accepting appliances unless the units have been processed to remove environmentally harmful materials.  As a result, old appliances usually cannot be discarded directly through ordinary solid waste systems.
 In addition to these solid waste management and environmental issues, energy conservation is another compelling reason for proper disposal of old appliances. The U.S. Department of Energy’s updated appliance energy efficiency standards that took effect in September 2014 require new refrigerators to be 25-to-30% more efficient than those manufactured only one year earlier. Refrigerators manufactured today use about one-fifth as much electricity as units made in the mid-1970s.
 While new refrigerators can save a significant amount of energy in the home, more than 30% of all U.S. households have a second refrigerator in the basement or garage. These units are typically 15-to-25 years old and consume about 750 to 1500 kilowatt-hours per year, driving electric bills up by more than $150 annually per household.
 Utilities have become important participants in dealing with energy inefficient appliances as a way of reducing peak demand on their systems and avoiding the capital and environmental costs of adding new generating capacity. To encourage the permanent removal of energy inefficient appliances from use, many electric utility companies sponsor programs through which their residential customers can retire working refrigerators, freezers, and room air conditioners.  Utility companies often provide assistance and incentives for consumers to discontinue use of a surplus appliance or to replace their old, inefficient appliances with newer, more efficient models. To help accomplish this, some utilities offer appliance replacement programs for some segments of their customers, through which older model kitchen and laundry appliances are recycled and new highly efficient ENERGY STAR® units are installed.

The EPA has been supportive of efforts by electric utilities and other entities that sponsor appliance recycling programs to ensure that the collected units are managed in an environmentally sound manner. In October 2006, the EPA launched RAD, a voluntary partnership program designed to help protect the ozone layer and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Through the program, RAD partners use best practices to recover ozone-depleting chemicals and other harmful materials from old refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners, and dehumidifiers. Because of our appliance recycling expertise, we were active participants in helping to design the RAD program and currently submit annual reports to the EPA to document the environmental benefits our utility customers that are RAD partners have achieved through their recycling programs.
 Our wholly-owned subsidiaries in our Recycling segment include, ARCA Canada Inc., a Canadian corporation formed in September 2006, ARCA Recycling, Inc., a California corporation formed in November 1991, and Customer Connexx, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in October 2016 that provides call center services for recycling business.  
 Technology
 On August 18, 2017, in a move to diversify our offering beyond our then-current appliance recycling capabilities, we acquired GeoTraq, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the acquisition, the Company tendered to the three owners of GeoTraq $200,000, issued to them an aggregate of 288,588 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (which were subsequently exchanged for shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock as discussed in this Form 10-K). 
 GeoTraq is a Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) technology company that designs innovative wireless modules that provide Location Based Services (“LBS”) and connect external sensors to the IoT. GeoTraq is planning to manufacture and sell wireless transceiver modules and subscription services that will allow connectivity using publicly available global Mobile IoT networks. GeoTraq addresses the large LBS market segment that is currently under served with existing solutions due to high deployment costs (hardware, service, logistics), limited battery life and large form factors. We believe that there is a large under-served portion of the LBS market that is not addressed by existing solutions. RFID and Wi-Fi require close proximity for asset tracking, while GPS is too bulky and uses too much power for many needs. GeoTraq addresses the white space in-between by designing wireless transceiver modules with technology that provides LBS directly from global Mobile IoT networks. GeoTraq’s technology allows for a substantially lower cost solution, extended service life, a small form factor, and even disposable devices, which we believe can significantly reduce return logistics costs.
 GeoTraq applied for and was granted Patent No. 10,182,402, which covers various aspects of operation of its Mobile IoT wireless modules. A description of the patent features and its various claims includes:
  
1. | An apparatus comprising: an interval timer; a power control; a Short Message Service (SMS) packetizer; a geo-locator; a radio frequency (RF) communicator; and a controller and a memory, the memory comprising instructions for the controller to operate the interval timer cooperatively with the power control to cause a transition of the geo-locator from a sleep state to a wake state after a preset defined time interval, and to operate the geo-locator to receive signal strength levels and corresponding cell IDs from a plurality of cellular base stations, and to operate the SMS packetizer to package the signal strength levels and the corresponding cell IDs into a first outgoing SMS message, and to communicate the first outgoing SMS message to a preset address using the RF communicator.

 With the GeoTraq acquisition, we expect to have the ability to deploy IoT devices to locate, monitor and track the movement of inventory and other assets and monitor connected sensors.  Our GeoTraq subsidiary has not generated any revenue to date, including in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021.
 ApplianceSmart, Inc.
 Prior to December 30, 2017, we sold new and out-of-the-box major household appliances in the United States though a chain of Company-owned retail stores operating under the name ApplianceSmart®.  On December 30, 2017, we, together with our then-subsidiary, ApplianceSmart, Inc. (“ApplianceSmart”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with ApplianceSmart Holdings LLC (the “Purchaser”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Live Ventures Incorporated (Nasdaq: Live), pursuant to which we sold to the Purchaser all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of ApplianceSmart (the “ApplianceSmart Stock”) in exchange for $6.5 million. Effective April 1, 2018, the Purchaser issued the Company a promissory note (the “ApplianceSmart Note”) with a three-year term in the original principal amount of $3.9 million for the balance of the purchase price. ApplianceSmart is guaranteeing the repayment of the ApplianceSmart Note. On December 26, 2018, the ApplianceSmart Note was amended and restated to grant ARCA a security interest in the assets of the Purchaser, ApplianceSmart, and ApplianceSmart Contracting Inc. in exchange for modifying the repayment terms to provide for the payment in full of all accrued interest and principal on April 1, 2021, the maturity date of the ApplianceSmart Note. On March 15, 2019, JanOne entered into subordination agreements with third parties, pursuant to which it agreed to subordinate the payment of indebtedness under the ApplianceSmart Note and its security interest in the assets of ApplianceSmart and other related parties in exchange for receipt of a payment of up to $1.2 million within 15 days of the subordination agreement.  On December 9, 2019, ApplianceSmart filed a voluntary petition (the “Chapter 11 Case”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”), seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”).  As of January 2, 2021, indebtedness owed by ApplianceSmart to JanOne is approximately $2.9 million.  However, JanOne has recorded a full valuation allowance for the entire amount of the indebtedness due to the uncertainty of repayment.

Customers and Source of Supply for Recycling and Technology
 Recycling: We contract with utility companies or their program administrators and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs to provide a full range of appliance recycling and replacement services to help them achieve their energy savings goals. The contracts usually have terms of one-to-three years, with provisions for renewal at the option of the utility. Under some contracts, we manage all aspects, including advertising of the appliance recycling or replacement program. Under other contracts, we provide only specified services, such as collection and recycling.
 GeoTraq: GeoTraq currently has no customers. GeoTraq sources its raw materials, including electronic chips, computers, and software from various third parties. GeoTraq is dependent on a single supplier for its modules.
 Principal Products and Services for Recycling and Technology
 Our recycling segment generates revenues from two sources: recycling and byproducts. Recycling revenues were generated by charging fees for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs and through the sale of new ENERGY STAR® appliances to utility companies for installation in the homes of a specific segment of their customers. Byproduct revenues were generated by selling scrap materials, such as metal and plastics, from appliances we collected and recycled. 
 Our technology segment is engaged in the development, design, and ultimately, we expect, the sale of cellular transceiver modules, also known as Mobile IoT modules. 
 Seasonality for Recycling and Technology
 Promotional activities for programs in which the utility sponsor conducts all advertising are generally strong during the second and third calendar quarters, leading to higher customer demand for services during that time period.  As a result, we experience a surge in business during the second and third calendar quarters, which generally declines through the fourth and first calendar quarters until advertising activities resume.
 Our technology segment did not have any customers at January 2, 2021.
 Competition for Recycling and Technology
 Recycling:
 We generally compete for contracts with several other appliance recycling businesses, energy services management companies, and new-appliance retailers. We also compete with small hauling or recycling companies that are based in the program’s service territory. Many of these companies, including used-appliance dealers that call themselves “appliance recyclers,” resell in the secondary market a percentage of the used appliances they accept for recycling.
 We expect our primary competition for appliance recycling and replacement contracts with existing and new customers to come from a variety of sources, including:
  
1. | Existing recycling companies.
---+------------------------------


2. | Entrepreneurs entering the appliance recycling business.
---+---------------------------------------------------------


3. | Major waste hauling companies.
---+-------------------------------


4. | Scrap metal processors.
---+------------------------


5. | National and regional new appliance retailers.
---+-----------------------------------------------

 In addition, utility companies and other customers may choose to provide all or some of the services required to operate their appliance recycling and replacement programs internally rather than contracting with outside vendors.

Technology
 GeoTraq plans on operating in an industry segment that is made of numerous competing technologies designed to connect devices to the IoT. The business’s wireless solution uses IoT based on LTE CAT-M and the newly released NB-IoT protocols that were defined in the GSMA’s (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) 3GPP Release 13 standard. The Mobile IoT industry utilizes radio spectrum that is licensed to wireless carries by various governmental regulatory agencies around the world. Mobile IoT is extremely competitive and constantly changing as carriers, manufacturers, and solution providers offer innovation to the IoT marketplace. GeoTraq believes there is a large under-served opportunity for “Simple IoT” solutions that significantly reduce the complexity, cycle time and cost of deploying LBS and sensor monitoring solutions. The company’s transceiver modules and associated wireless connectivity subscription service is specifically targeted at accomplishing these objectives.
Government Regulation for Recycling and Technology
 Recycling
 Federal, state, and local governments regulate appliance collection, recycling, and sales activities. While some requirements apply nationwide, others vary by market. The many laws and regulations that affect appliance recycling include landfill disposal restrictions, hazardous waste management requirements, and air quality standards. For example, the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act prohibit the venting of all Refrigerants while servicing or disposing of appliances.
 Each of our recycling facilities maintains the appropriate registrations, permits, and licenses for operating at its location. We register our recycling centers as hazardous waste generators with the EPA and obtain all appropriate regional and local licenses for managing hazardous wastes. Licensed hazardous waste companies transport and recycle or dispose of the hazardous materials we generate. Our collection vehicles and our transportation employees are required to comply with all U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) licensing requirements.
 Approximately 30 of ARCA Recycling’s clients participate in the EPA’s voluntary RAD program by committing to employ best environmental practices to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases through the proper disposal of refrigeration appliances at end of life. We prepare annual RAD reports that quantify the materials collected to submit to EPA on behalf of our clients.
 Although we believe that further governmental regulation of the appliance recycling industry could have a positive effect on us, we cannot predict the direction of future legislation. Under some circumstances, for example, further regulation could materially increase our operational costs or reduce environmental requirements for disposing of appliances at end of life. In addition, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liabilities because we handle hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.
 Technology
 GeoTraq’s Mobile IoT modules utilize low-power wireless transmitters that emit RF energy waves, which are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and may be subject to regulation by other domestic and international agencies. GeoTraq believes that FCC rules Part 15, Part 20, Part 22, Part 24, and Part 27 may apply to the company’s products. GeoTraq believes that its products are safe and will utilize FCC accredited testing laboratories to verify and certify that its modules comply with all required regulatory requirements. In addition, GeoTraq intends to seek and obtain necessary licenses and permits from the FCC and other regulatory agencies as required by law.
Employees
 On January 2, 2021, we had 179 employees, of which 172 were full-time employees.
