Item 1.  Business
Overview
Greenhill is a leading independent investment bank that provides financial and strategic advice on significant domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, financings, capital raising and other transactions to a diverse client base, including corporations, private equity sponsors, institutional investors, family offices, and governments globally. We serve as a trusted advisor to our clients throughout the world on a collaborative, globally integrated basis from our offices in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
At Greenhill, we are singularly focused on providing conflict-free advice to clients on a wide variety of complex financial matters, using our global resources to provide a combination of transaction experience, industry sector expertise and knowledge of relevant regional markets. We work seamlessly across offices and markets to provide the highest caliber advice and services to our clients.
Greenhill was established in 1996 by Robert F. Greenhill, the former President of Morgan Stanley and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Smith Barney. Greenhill was formed as a limited liability company and converted to a Delaware corporation in 2004 at the time of our IPO. Since our founding, Greenhill has grown significantly, by recruiting talented and diverse managing directors and other senior professionals, acquiring complementary advisory businesses and training, developing and promoting professionals internally. We have expanded beyond merger and acquisition advisory services to include financing, restructuring, and private capital advisory services, and we have expanded the breadth of our sector expertise to cover substantially all major industries. Since the opening of our original office in New York, we have expanded globally to 15 offices across four continents.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 382 employees globally. At that date, we had 79 client facing managing directors. 
Advisory Services
Greenhill is a unique global investment banking Firm. Greenhill’s singular focus on advisory services differentiates us from other investment banks, and enables us to offer best-in-class, conflict free service to each of our clients. Many of our peers as well as the large integrated, or “bulge bracket” institutions engage in commercial lending, underwriting, research, sales and trading and other businesses and investment management, all of which can create conflicts with clients’ interests. 
•Advising clients is our only business. We do not engage in investing, trading, lending, underwriting, research or investment management businesses. Our clients’ interests are our sole priority. 
•We provide unbiased, conflict-free advice. We have no products or additional services to cross-sell and, thus, no inherent conflicts of interest. We also have no lending, prime brokerage or other relationships with activist investors.
•We offer a globally integrated, collaborative approach to client service. Our professionals around the globe work together on a fully-integrated, one-firm, one-team approach to advance the interests of our clients. 
•We maintain the highest levels of confidentiality. Our advisory-only business model and minimal conflicts enable us to maintain greater client confidentiality.
•Senior level attention is fundamental to our model. Our managing directors, who are seasoned professionals with both transaction expertise and sector and regional knowledge, are actively engaged in our client mandates from origination through execution and closing. 
We provide comprehensive financial advisory services primarily in connection with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, financings, private capital raising and other similar transactions. We also provide advice in connection with shareholder defense preparedness, activist investor response strategies and other critical strategic matters. For all of our advisory services, we draw on the extensive experience, senior relationships and industry expertise of our managing directors and senior advisors.
Mergers and Acquisitions. On merger and acquisition engagements, we provide a broad range of advice to global clients in relation to domestic and cross-border mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs and other strategic transactions, through all stages of a transaction’s life cycle, from initial structuring and negotiation to final execution. Our focus is on providing high-quality, unbiased advice to senior executive management teams, boards of directors and special committees of prominent large and mid-cap companies, financial sponsors and key decision makers in governments and at large institutions on transactions that typically are of the highest strategic and financial importance to our clients. We have specialists in nearly every significant industry sector who work closely with our transaction and regional specialists to provide the highest quality advice and transaction execution. In addition to merger and acquisition transactions, we advise clients on a full range of critical strategic matters, including activist shareholder defense, special committee projects, licensing deals and joint ventures. We provide advice on valuation, negotiation tactics, industry dynamics, structuring alternatives, timing and pricing of transactions, as well as financing alternatives. In appropriate situations, we also provide fairness opinions with regard to merger and acquisition transactions.
Financing Advisory and Restructuring. Our financing advisory and restructuring practice encompasses a wide range of advisory services. In restructurings, we advise debtors, creditors, governments, and other stakeholders, as well as potential acquirers of companies experiencing financial distress. We provide advice on and, as applicable, assist in negotiations with respect to, valuation, debt capacity, liability management, restructuring or other capitalization alternatives, capital structures, financing alternatives and M&A in both in-court and out-of-court processes. In financing advisory, we structure tailored solutions for our clients by advising on private placements of debt and structured equity, refinancing of existing debt facilities, negotiating the modification and amendment of covenants and acting as an independent advisor. In this role we either assist clients in raising capital through a structured process conducted by us or we serve as an independent advisor providing advice as to the terms and conditions of financings from incumbent lenders or relationship banks and lenders. 
Private Capital Advisory. We are one of the leading global financial advisors to pension funds, endowments, institutional investors and financial sponsors on primary and secondary transactions involving alternative assets. Using our primary capital formation expertise, we provide clients with customized fundraising solutions, including single asset capital transactions, blind pool funds and co-investment syndications, and targeted investor outreach through our global team of senior distribution professionals. Fundraising mandates are focused on general private equity, specialist sector funds, credit strategies, real assets and venture capital. Greenhill advises such institutions globally on secondary sales of interests in private equity and similar funds, and provides advice to alternative asset fund sponsors for private capital raising, restructuring, financing, liquidity options, valuation and related services. 
Revenues
Our revenues are derived from both corporate advisory services related to mergers and acquisitions ("M&A"), financings and restructurings and private capital advisory services related to sales or capital raises pertaining to alternative assets. Revenues from corporate advisory are primarily driven by total deal volume and the size of individual transactions. While fees payable upon the successful conclusion of a transaction generally represent the largest portion of our corporate advisory fees, we also earn other fees, including on-going retainer fees, substantially all of which relate to non-success based strategic advisory, financing advisory, and restructuring assignments, and fees payable upon the commencement of an engagement or upon the achievement of certain milestones such as the announcement of a transaction or the rendering of a fairness opinion. Additionally, we generate private capital advisory revenues from sales and/or the restructuring of alternative assets in the secondary market and from capital raises for new private funds where we act as private placement agents. 
Human Capital
As an independent investment bank focused solely on advisory services, our people are our primary asset. We strive to develop and promote a culture that fosters collegiality, teamwork, professionalism, excellence, diversity and collaboration among our employees worldwide to deliver high quality results to our clients and create long term career development opportunities for our personnel. Our day to day conduct, as embodied by our Code of Ethics, seeks to ensure that everyone feels welcome, respected and valued so that they can contribute to their fullest potential.
Approximately 35% of our advisory managing directors have worked at Greenhill for more than 10 years; as a group our managing directors average more than 20 years of varied and relevant experience, which they leverage to provide the highest quality advice on a globally-integrated basis across our full range of services. Our managing directors are supported by a strong team of more junior professionals, and we spend a significant amount of time and resources recruiting, training and mentoring them. As an equal opportunity employer, all qualified applicants receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin or ancestry, age, disability or veteran status, or other protected status.
Employee development is an important element of our human capital management program. We seek to provide our junior professionals with high quality technical training as well as broad exposure to a variety of assignments involving mergers and 
acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, financings, capital raisings and other transactions. This approach provides us with the flexibility to allocate resources depending on the transaction environment and provides our bankers with a wide variety of experiences to assist in the development of their business and financial judgment. We utilize a comprehensive evaluation process at the end of each year to measure performance, determine compensation and provide guidance on opportunities for continued development.
We strive to provide comprehensive packages of competitive compensation and benefits in each market in which we operate, which we believe is important to ensure our employees’ health, well-being and financial security. We review the competitiveness of our compensation and benefits frequently. With respect to our senior employees, we seek to align their compensation with the interests of our shareholders through stock-based incentive compensation programs. 
The safety of our employees has always been a priority. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, work-place safety and employee well-being assumed even greater importance and our employees were given the flexibility to manage their work place and personal priorities. As COVID-19 "work from home" government mandates eased we encouraged our employees to return to the office in order to continue to build their professional skills and development and feel more connected to each other as well as the Firm. Each of our offices has continued to prioritize work place safety and our employee benefits continue to include mental health services. Regardless of the pandemic our senior personnel have continued to demonstrate leadership by, among other things, proactively reaching out to our more junior professionals to mentor and offer their support both professionally and personally when necessary. A combination of our efforts has yielded positive results and we have been able to retain much of our talent as planned in 2022 following a higher than usual attrition rate, which was consistent with our peers and across our industry, as a consequence of "The Great Resignation" .
As of December 31, 2022, Greenhill employed a total of 382 people, of which 219 were located in our offices in North America, 111 were based in our European offices, and 52 in the rest of the world. The vast majority of our finance, legal and operational employees are located in the United States. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long-term contracted sources of revenue. Each revenue-generating engagement is separately awarded and negotiated. Our list of clients with whom we have an active engagement changes continually. To develop new client relationships, and to develop new engagements from historic client relationships, we maintain, on an ongoing basis, business dialogues with a large number of clients and potential clients. We have gained a significant number of new clients each year through our business development initiatives, through recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and expertise in certain industry sectors or geographies and through referrals from members of boards of directors, attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships. At the same time, we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client, a change in a client’s senior management team, competition from other investment banks and other causes.
The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are global and regional integrated banking firms, mid-sized full service financial firms, other independent financial services firms and specialized financial advisory firms. We compete with some of our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product, industry or niche basis. We also compete on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of our advice and service, our range of sector expertise, strength of relationships, innovation, reputation and price.
The global and regional integrated banking firms offer a wider range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, hedging, foreign exchange, asset management and corporate finance and securities underwriting services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support their investment banking operations with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure on our business. In addition to our larger and mid-sized full service competitors, we compete with a number of independent investment banks which offer independent advisory services on a model similar to ours. A number of the independent banks with whom we compete are larger and have greater general and industry-specific coverage resources.
We believe our primary competitors consist of both large, diversified financial institutions such as Bank of America Corporation, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, and UBS AG, as well as publicly listed boutique investment banking firms such as Evercore Partners Inc., Jefferies Group, Inc., Lazard Ltd., Moelis & Co., Perella Weinberg Partners and PJT Partners. 
Competition can be intense for the hiring and retention of talented employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.

Regulation
Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of parties participating in those markets. 
Certain of our operations are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. Our activities are subject to financial markets regulation in the following jurisdictions:
United States
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws and the protection of investors who invest in Greenhill. Greenhill & Co., LLC (“G&Co LLC”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greenhill through which we conduct our U.S. advisory business. It is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing conduct, and examines the activities of its member firms such as G&Co LLC. State and local banking and securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over G&Co LLC. 
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business. Our business model is exclusively focused on providing strategic advice to clients and we do not hold customer funds or securities, or carry on research, securities trading, lending or underwriting activities. While this means that certain broker-dealer regulations, such as those pertaining to the use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities and the financing of customers’ purchases, may not be applicable to us, we remain subject to other applicable broker-dealer regulations, including regulatory capital levels, record keeping and reporting requirements, and the conduct and qualifications of officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, G&Co LLC is subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant portion of a broker-dealer’s assets be retained in liquid financial instruments relative to the amount of its liabilities. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.
Europe
Greenhill & Co. International LLP, our wholly owned affiliated partnership with an office in the United Kingdom, through which we conduct a large portion of our European advisory business, is authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The current UK regulatory regime, that governs all aspects of our advisory business in the United Kingdom, is based upon the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), together with secondary legislation and other rules made under the FSMA. 
Greenhill Europe GmbH & Co. KG houses our offices in Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris, with particular focus on our European advisory business. Greenhill Europe GmbH & Co. KG is authorized and regulated by the Bundesanstalt fur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (“BaFin”) and the Deutsche Bundesbank. In addition, the Firm has a regulated branch in Spain, which is regulated and authorized by the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (“CNMV”), and in France, which is authorized and regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Régulation (“ACPR”). 
Greenhill & Co. Sweden AB, our wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary with an office in Stockholm, provides financial advice to clients in Sweden and the wider Nordic region. It is currently unregulated. 
Australia
Greenhill & Co. Australia Pty Limited (“Greenhill Australia”), our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, is licensed and subject to regulation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) and must also comply with applicable provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 and other Australian legal and regulatory requirements, including capital adequacy rules, customer protection rules, and compliance with other applicable trading and investment banking regulations. 
Hong Kong
Greenhill & Co. Asia Limited, a wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, is licensed under the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance with the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and is regulated by the SFC. The compliance requirements of the SFC include, among other things, net capital, stockholders’ equity and periodic reporting requirements, and also the registration and training of certain employees and responsible officers.
Singapore

LTD., a wholly-owned Singapore subsidiary, is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and licensed under the Securities and Futures Act to conduct the regulated activities of dealing in capital markets products and advising on corporate finance.

Our business may also be subject to regulation by other governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in other countries where Greenhill operates or conducts business.
Anti-money laundering, Sanctions and Bribery Legislation
Federal anti-money-laundering laws make it a criminal offense to own or operate a money transmitting business without the appropriate state licenses, which we maintain, and require registration with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), where we are registered. In addition, pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Treasury Department’s implementing federal regulations, as a “financial institution,” we have established and maintain an anti-money-laundering program. We are generally prohibited from dealing with “Specially Designated Nationals” or SDNs, that are identified by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. Similar restrictions have been issued in the U.K. by HM Treasury. We are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, region or government that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.
We also are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We are also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the United States and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules, and regulations.
Data Privacy
As part of our business we routinely receive sensitive and confidential information from our clients. We also collect personal information from our prospective and current employees, as permitted by employment laws and regulation. As a result, we are subject to the laws and regulations in relation to privacy of the U.S. federal and state governments (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA")) as well as those of several non-U.S. governments, their agencies and self-regulatory organizations, such as the U.K. and E.U.’s data privacy and security framework titled the General Data Protection Regulations (the “GDPR”).
For a discussion of risks related to the regulations to which we are subject, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this annual report.
