ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Changes From Prior Periodic Reports

In this report we have complied with the disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") release No. 33-10825 "Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105" and we have early adopted the changes in disclosure standards included in SEC release No. 33-10890 "Management's Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information."
Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103 and 105
Effective as of November 9, 2020, the SEC issued Release No. 33-10825, “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105”. This release was adopted to modernize the description of business, legal proceedings, and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. Specifically, this release requires registrants to provide disclosure relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures. Additionally, the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party. This report reflects these changes. 
These changes are required for any annual period subsequent to the effective date of November 9, 2020. As such we have adopted these changes in this report.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information
In November 2020, the SEC issued Release No. 33-10890, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information” which will become fully effective on August 9, 
2021, with voluntary compliance permitted on or after February 10, 2021. This release was adopted to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) to, among other things, eliminate the requirement of the contractual obligations table.
With our early adoption of this release we have eliminated from this report the items discussed above that are no longer required. Information on our material contractual obligations is still disclosed in the narrative within the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Business Overview and Purpose
We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing our customers with an array of communications services and solutions. Our specific products and services are detailed below under the heading "Operations - Products and Services."
Our ultimate parent company, Lumen Technologies, Inc., has cash management arrangements or loan arrangements with a majority of its subsidiaries that include lines of credit, affiliate obligations, capital contributions and dividends. Under these arrangements, the majority of our cash balance is advanced on a daily basis for centralized management by an affiliate of Lumen, and most affiliate transactions are deemed to be settled at the time the transactions are recorded. The resulting net balance at the end of each period is reported as advances to affiliates or advances from affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets. From time to time we may declare and pay dividends to our parent, QSC. The dividends are settled in accordance with the cash management process described above, which has the net effect of reducing our advances to affiliates or increasing our advances from affiliates. 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado in 1911. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyLink Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318) 388-9000.
For a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report. The summary financial information in this Item 1 should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 8 of Part II of this report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.

Operations 
For the reasons noted in Note 14—Products and Services Revenue to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, we believe we have one reportable segment. 
Products and Services 
While most of our customized customer interactions involve multiple integrated technologies and services, we organize our products and services according to the core technologies that drive them. At December 31, 2020, we reported our related revenue under the following categories: IP and Data Services, Transport and Infrastructure Services, Voice and Collaboration Services, IT and Managed Services, Regulatory Revenue and Affiliate Services, each of which is described in further detail below. 
IP and Data Services
•Ethernet. We deliver a robust array of networking services built on Ethernet technology. Ethernet services include point-to-point and multi-point equipment configurations that facilitate data transmissions across metropolitan areas and larger enterprise-class wide area networks. Our Ethernet technology is also used by wireless service providers for data transmission via our fiber-optic cables connected to their towers; and
•Retail Video. Our retail video services span a range of technologies aimed at consumers and business customers. We also offer various broadcast services to deliver audio and video feeds over fiber or satellite for broadcast and production firms
Transport and Infrastructure
•Broadband. Our broadband services deliver a cost-effective Internet connection through existing telephone lines or fiber-optic cables while customers enjoy high speed data transfer. A substantial portion of our broadband subscribers are located within the local service area of our wireline telephone operations; 
•Private Line. We deliver private line services, a direct circuit or channel specifically dedicated for connecting two or more organizational sites. Private line service offers a high-speed, secure solution for frequent transmission of large amounts of data between sites, including wireless backhaul transmissions; 
•Unbundled Network Elements and Other. We provide select technology elements to other network carriers on a regional basis who include those technologies in their offerings; and 
•Wavelength. We deliver high bandwidth optical networks to firms requiring an end-to-end transport solution with Ethernet technology by contracting for a scalable amount of bandwidth connecting sites or providing high-speed access to cloud computing resources.
Voice and Collaboration
•Voice. We offer our customers a complete portfolio of traditional Time Division Multiplexing voice services including Primary Rate Interface service, local inbound service, switched one-plus, toll free, long distance and international services.
IT and Managed Services
•Information Technology ("IT") Services. Our IT-based services deliver strategic consulting and solutions to C-suite executives in mid to large enterprises. These services involve architecting technologies to address business needs. Solutions range from System Integration Services to Big Data Analytics, building and managing strategic application suites such as SAP and deploying security technologies. In many cases, we operate and manage these solutions on behalf of customers once they are deployed.
Regulatory Revenue
•Universal Service Fund ("USF") Support Payments. We receive federal and state USF support payment subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from operations; and
•Connect America Fund ("CAF"). We receive federal support payments from CAF II of the CAF program. The funding from the CAF II support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in 33 states.
Affiliate Revenue
•Affiliate Services. We provide our affiliates certain telecommunication services that we also provide to external customers. Please see our products and services listed above for further description of these services. In addition, we provide our affiliates computer system development and support services, network support and technical services.
From time to time, we may change the categorization of our products and services.
Our Network 
Our and Lumen's network, through which we provide most of our products and services consists of fiber-optic and copper cables, high-speed transport equipment, electronics, voice switches, data switches and routers, and various other equipment. We operate part of our network with leased assets, and a substantial portion of our equipment with licensed software.
We and Lumen view our network as one of our most critical assets. We and Lumen have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, substantial resources to (i) simplify and modernize our network and legacy systems and (ii) expand our and Lumen’s network to address demand for enhanced or new products.
Although either we or Lumen own most of our network, we lease a substantial portion of our core fiber network from several other communication companies under arrangements that will periodically need to be renewed or replaced to support our current network operations.
Like other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of various degrees, and from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruption in our services.
For additional information regarding our systems, network assets, network risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see "Risk Factors," in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Competition and Market Overview
Organizations across the globe are competing to capitalize on opportunities created by emerging technologies. The need for data-intensive and latency-sensitive emerging technologies continues to grow. Helping businesses address these needs requires a platform that integrates essential technology services.
Competition
We compete in a dynamic and highly competitive market, and we expect continued intense competition from a wide variety of sources under these evolving market conditions. In addition to competition from large communications providers, we are increasingly facing competition from systems integrators, cloud service providers, software companies, infrastructure companies, cable companies, device providers, resellers, and smaller niche providers, among others. 
Our ability to compete hinges upon effectively enhancing and better integrating our existing products, introducing new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meeting changing customer needs, providing high-quality information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extending our core technology into new applications and anticipating emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.
Depending on the applicable market and requested services, competition can be intense, especially if one or more competitors in the market have network assets better suited to the customer’s needs, are offering faster transmission speeds or lower prices, or in certain markets, are incumbent communications providers that have a longer history of providing service in the market. 
For our traditional voice services, providers of wireless voice, social networking and electronic messaging services are significant competitors as many customers are increasingly relying on these providers to communicate, resulting in the long-term systemic decline we have seen in our legacy, traditional voice services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing our local networks, either partially or completely, through various means. Developments in software have permitted new competitors to offer affordable networking products that historically required more expensive hardware investment. We anticipate that all these trends will continue to place downward pressures on the use of our network.
Additionally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 obligates the incumbent local telephone companies ("ILECs"), to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC’s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, including obligations to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory “unbundled” access to specific portions of the ILEC’s network and (iii) permit competitors to physically or virtually colocate their plant on the ILEC’s property. As a result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, we also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through (i) reselling an ILEC's local services, (ii) using an ILEC's unbundled network elements (iii) operating their own facilities or (iv) a combination thereof.
Competition for higher margin, legacy services remains high. However, our and Lumen’s platform expansion and innovation strategy is focused largely on addressing these competitive pressures. As both residential and business customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To remain competitive and successful, we are continuing to invest in network security, reliability and flexibility and design innovations to deliver competitive services to meet increasing customer bandwidth and speed requirements.
Additional information about competitive pressures is located under the heading "Risk Factors—Business Risks" in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 
Market Overview
Understanding and anticipating market trends drives our investment in developing the products and services we believe will be well received by our customers. As use cases continue to emerge, we expect secure network services will increase in importance as consumers require holistic solutions with the flexibility necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities with digital content. We believe we and Lumen have a world-class set of global fiber assets that positions us to deliver a highly-competitive suite of services.
We generally market our business services to members of in-house IT departments or other highly-sophisticated customers with deep technological experience. These individuals typically satisfy their IT requirements by contracting with us or a rapidly evolving group of competitors, or by deploying in-house solutions. We expect our market competition to continue to increase as technology evolves and enables our customers to seek solutions from multiple sources. We compete to provide services to business customers based on a variety of factors, including the comprehensiveness and reliability of our network, our data transmission speeds, price, the latency of our available intercity and metro routes, the scope of our integrated offerings, the reach and peering capacity of our IP network, and customer service.
As noted above, technological and competitive factors have led to new products and services that have reduced the demand for certain of our traditional network services, especially our traditional ILEC services. Also, market demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by advanced wireless data transmission technologies and other systems delivering generally faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours.
Sales and Marketing
Our enterprise sales and marketing approach revolves around solving complex customer problems with advanced technology and network solutions- striving to make core networks services compatible with digital tools. We also rely on our call center personnel and a variety of channel partners to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. To meet the needs of different customers, our offerings include both stand-alone services and bundled services designed to provide a complete offering of integrated services.
Our sales and marketing approach to our business customers includes a commitment to provide comprehensive communications and IT solutions for business, wholesale and government customers of all sizes, ranging from small business offices to select enterprise customers. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including telecommunications agents, system integrators, value-added resellers and other telecommunications firms. We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, website promotions and public relations. We maintain local offices in most of the larger population centers within our local service area. These offices provide sales and customer support services to the communities in our local markets. 
Similarly, our sales and marketing approach to our mass market customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. Our approach includes marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including retailers, satellite television providers, door to door sales agents and digital marketing firms.
Research, Development & Intellectual Property
Due to the dynamic nature of our industry, we prioritize investing in developing new products, improving existing products, and licensing third party intellectual property rights to anticipate and meet our customers’ evolving needs. Patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patented technology. We, or our affiliates, plan to continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing.
In addition to our patent rights, either directly or through our affiliates, we have rights in various trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property that we use to conduct our business. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others as we deem appropriate. 
For information on various litigation risks associated with owning and using intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors—Business Risks” in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and Note 16—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.
Regulations
Our domestic operations are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), by various state utility commissions and occasionally by local agencies. For information on the risks associated with the regulations discussed below, see “Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 
Changes in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenue, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, which makes future planning more difficult.
The following description discusses some of the major regulations that affect our operations, but various others could have a substantial impact on us. 
Federal Regulation
General
The FCC regulates the interstate services we provide, including the business data service charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and intercarrier compensation, including the interstate access charges that we bill other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates several aspects of our business related to international communications services, privacy, public safety and network infrastructure, including our access to and use of local telephone numbers and our provision of emergency 911 services. 
Many of the FCC’s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors. The following description discusses some of the major regulations affecting our operations, but others could have a substantial impact on us as well. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Universal Service
In 2015, Lumen Technologies accepted Connect America Fund or "CAF" funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 of the 37 states in which we or Lumen are an ILEC under the CAF Phase II high-cost support program. As a result of accepting CAF Phase II support payments for 33 states, we are obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build infrastructure by certain specified milestone deadlines. In accordance with the FCC's January 2020 order, Lumen Technologies elected to receive an additional year of CAF Phase II funding in 2021.
In early 2020, the FCC created the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (the “RDOF”) which is a new federal support program designed to replace the CAF Phase II program. On December 7, 2020, the FCC allocated in its RDOF Phase I auction $9.2 billion in support payments over 10 years to deploy high speed broadband to over 5.2 million unserved locations. Lumen Technologies won bids for RDOF Phase I support payments of $26 million annually. These RDOF Phase I support payments are expected to begin January 1, 2022. 
For additional information about the potential financial impact of the CAF Phase II program, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Broadband Regulation
In February 2015, the FCC adopted an order classifying Broadband Internet Access Services ("BIAS") under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and applying new regulations. In December 2017, the FCC voted to repeal most of those regulations and the classification of BIAS as a Title II service and to preempt states from imposing substantial regulations on broadband. Opponents of this change appealed this action in federal court. Several states have also opposed the change and have initiated state executive orders or introduced legislation focused on state-specific Internet service regulation. In October 2019, the federal court upheld the FCC’s classification decision but vacated a part of its preemption ruling. The court also requested the FCC to make further findings relating to its classification decision. Numerous parties have appealed this decision, which remain pending. In addition, members of the Biden Administration and various consumer interest groups have advocated in favor of reclassifying BIAS under Title II. The ultimate impact of these pending judicial appeals and calls for additional regulation are currently unknown to us, although the imposition of heightened regulation of our Internet operations could potentially hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of operating, maintaining and upgrading our network, and otherwise negatively impact our current operations.
State Regulation of Domestic Operations
In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs, including ours. Nonetheless, state regulatory commissions generally continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) limit ILECs' ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various other service standards. In most states, switched and business data services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region.
Data Privacy Regulations
Various foreign, federal and state laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of consumer protection, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. Data privacy regulations are complex and vary across jurisdictions. We must comply with various jurisdictional data 
privacy regulations, adopted by various jurisdictions in certain of our domestic markets. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These regulations require careful handling of personal and customer data. We have data handling policies and practices to comply with data privacy requirements, and have resources dedicated to complying with changing data privacy regulations. 
Other Regulations
Our networks and properties are subject to numerous federal, state, and/or local regulations, including environmental compliance and remediation expenses. We are also subject to codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations are enacted by municipalities, counties, state, federal, or other regional governmental bodies, and can vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as a result. Such regulations may also require us to pay substantial fees. 
Seasonality
Overall, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. Our network-related operating expenses are, however, generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. From time to time, weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year, but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms in our markets.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 14,400 employees, of which approximately 6,300 are members of either the Communications Workers of America ("CWA") or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW"). See "Risk Factors— Business Risks" in Item 1A of Part I of this report and Note 18—Labor Union Contracts to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for a discussion of risks relating to our labor relations and for additional information on the timing of certain contract expirations.
