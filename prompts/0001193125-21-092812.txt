Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing our novel class of highly specific and selective antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumor cancer. Our CABs capitalize on our proprietary discoveries with respect to tumor biology, enabling us to target known and widely validated tumor antigens that have previously been difficult or impossible to target. Our novel CAB therapeutic candidates exploit characteristic pH differences between the tumor microenvironment and healthy tissue. Unlike healthy tissue, the tumor microenvironment is acidic, and we have designed our antibodies to selectively bind to their targets on tumor cells under acidic pH conditions but not on targets in normal tissues. Our approach is to identify the necessary targeting and potency required for cancer cell destruction, while aiming to eliminate or greatly reduce on-target, off-tumor toxicityone of the fundamental challenges of existing cancer therapies. 
 The broad applicability of our CAB technology allows us to develop a wide array of product candidate modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T cells. A key advantage of our application of the CAB technology to antibodies is that it allows us to selectively target antigens on tumor cells and minimizes or eliminates binding to these antigens on normal cells, which reduces the toxicity associated with traditional approaches. We have initiated potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 trials for our two latest stage ADC product candidates, BA3011 (targeting AXL) and BA3021 (targeting ROR2) in multiple cancer indications,

  including sarcoma, NSCLC and melanoma. The FDA has reviewed the trial designs, but has not opined on whether the Phase 2 clinical trials will in fact be sufficient to support regulatory approval. However, the FDA is expected to consider this further at the interim data review point. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree that such data will be sufficient to support approval. We are also supporting investigator-initiated trials for both BA3011 and BA3021 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We have observed encouraging initial clinical signs of response to treatment and a wide therapeutic window, or range of dosage and duration. BA3011 and BA3021 have the potential to address large unmet medical needs in indications that together account for more than 350,000 new cases of solid tumor cancers and 150,000 deaths per year, in the United States alone. Additionally, we plan to work with our partner BeiGene to initiate Phase 1 trials in multiple cancer indications in 2021 for our immuno-oncology antibody, BA3071 (targeting CTLA-4), which is designed to overcome the toxicity limitations of the currently approved anti-CTLA-4 antibody, to improve patient outcomes. We also have several candidates in our preclinical pipeline that include CAB bispecific antibodies targeting unmet medical needs in multiple types of solid tumors. 
 Our goal is to develop well-tolerated, novel cancer therapies that provide cures or extended survival to ensure patients improved quality of life. Studies have shown that, as a drug class, antibodies have transformed oncology treatment and include some of the best-selling therapies on the biopharmaceutical market. While therapeutic antibodies have emerged as one of the most successful strategies for both solid and blood-based, or hematologic, malignancies, toxicity has narrowed the therapeutic window and ultimate potential of impacting disease, as many of the key targets on tumor cells are also prevalent on normal cells. By exploiting our novel understanding of tumor biology, including unique characteristics of pH in the tumor microenvironment, we believe that our CAB technology has the potential to transform antibody-based cancer therapy. We have created and patented our CAB technology to enable the development of antibodies that are active in the tumor microenvironment, but inactive under normal physiological conditions, while maintaining target-specific binding. The biology of tumor formation, or tumorigenesis, yields a unique microenvironment consisting of a complex mixture of tumor cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells like microglia, macrophages and lymphocytes and the non-cellular components of extracellular matrix such as collagen, fibronectin, hyaluronan and laminin, among others. The process of tumor formation creates an altered, unique microenvironment in and around the tumor that is also physically and chemically distinct from healthy tissue, with regard to temperature, pressure, chemical composition and especially the acidity or pH. The tumorigenesis-driven shifts in microenvironment conditions further weaken the immune response and promote tumor growth. Our CAB technology aims to uniquely exploit the fundamental pH differences between the tumor and healthy tissue, increasing antibody binding selectivity and thereby potentially eliminating or greatly reducing healthy cell on-target, off-tumor toxicity. This enhanced selectivity has the potential to greatly improve the benefit-risk ratio for the patient and allows us to deliver desired drug levels either as monotherapy or utilizing unique multi-targeted or combination therapies that are currently difficult or impossible to develop. Additionally, the combination of reversible binding with the selective, precision capability of our CAB technology enables both increased antibody potency and reduced toxicity. 
 Initially, we applied the reversible binding and precision capability of our CAB technology to develop next-generation ADC therapies. Traditional ADCs are a class of biologic drugs that are designed by attaching a toxic small molecule payload to an antibody, which then targets a specific antigen expressed on the target cell, but unfortunately, in most cases, this target is also present on normal tissue. Binding to the target on normal tissue leads to high on-target, off-tumor toxicity, which reduces the utility of traditional ADCs. Our CAB ADCs are designed to selectively bind to the antigens found in acidic pH conditions found in the tumor microenvironment, which has the potential to reduce off-tumor toxicity and related consequences. In addition, we developed CAB antibodies to immuno-oncology targets such as CTLA-4 for antitumor activity. We believe that our CAB technology can reduce the limitations resulting from systemic toxicities and expand the utility of this immuno-oncology therapy. We are also creating bispecific, T cell engaging, CAB antibodies that are comprised of two different binding specificities, which allows the antibody to bind to two specific targets at the same time, generally one target on the tumor cell and one target on an immune system cell. This is a powerful approach to harness cytotoxic T cells to directly kill tumor cells with reduced toxicity.

 Our pipeline 
 We believe that there is significant potential to improve therapeutics for our patients with our proprietary CAB antibody technology across well-validated oncology targets activated in solid tumors. The following table summarizes our current product candidate pipeline. 
 

BA3011: Our lead product candidate, BA3011, is a CAB ADC that targets AXL, a protein that is highly expressed on the surface of many tumors. AXL is considered to be a driver of many cellular processes that are critical for the development, growth and spread of tumors, including proliferation, invasiveness and migration, stemness, which is related to core stem cell properties such as self-renewal and differentiation, angiogenesis, or the growth of blood vessels, and immune modulation. In preclinical studies, we have observed that BA3011 binds to AXL under conditions that reflect those in tumors. AXL has also been shown to be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or EMT, a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. MSCs are home to developing aggressive tumors, where they exacerbate cancer cell proliferation, motility, invasion and metastasis, foster angiogenesis, promote tumor fibrosis and suppress antitumor immune responses. Multiple therapeutic agents that target AXL have been developed and investigated in clinical trials. A number of small-molecule AXL kinase inhibitors have been developed; however, the majority of these inhibitors that have been taken into the clinic, including one that has been approved, are not highly selective for AXL. Some anti-AXL antibodies in the clinic have shown encouraging signs of antitumor activity; however, adverse events, such as high-grade constipation and peripheral neuropathy, were particularly pronounced. 
 We have developed a quantitative biomarker assay that is called the AXL Tumor membrane Percent Score, or TmPS. The TmPS measures the level of target expression on the tumor membrane which, consistent with industry standard, we use to identify those patients who we believe will be the most likely to respond to our product candidates. We believe that the higher the level of target expression on the tumor membrane, the more likely it is that our product candidates may have the potential to produce a response.

 BA3011 is an ADC consisting of a CAB humanized immunoglobulin G, or IgG1, anti-AXL monoclonal antibody. The core antibody is conjugated using a cleavable linker to the well-known and proven toxin monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. BA3011 was designed to specifically and reversibly bind to AXL in conditions found within the tumor microenvironment, thus conferring a selectivity binding advantage for tumors over normal cells. Upon binding of BA3011 to AXL on the surface of tumor cells, it is internalized and the MMAE cytotoxin is released, leading to cell killing. 
 We are developing BA3011 as a potential therapeutic for multiple solid tumors, including soft tissue and bone sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and others, such as ovarian cancer. We have completed a Phase 1 trial in patients with refractory solid tumors, established a recommended Phase 2 dose, and continue to dose patients that are responding to therapy. As of December 1, 2020, five patients have achieved a partial response and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity has been observed in additional patients. We have shown that there appears to be a correlation of antitumor activity with tumor membrane expression of AXL and have developed a robust, quantitative immunohistochemistry assay. We recently initiated dosing in a potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in soft tissue and bone sarcoma. We have also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in PD-1 refractory NSCLC patients. The FDA has reviewed the trial designs, but has not opined on whether the Phase 2 clinical trials will in fact be sufficient to support regulatory approval. However, the FDA is expected to consider this further at the interim data review point. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree that such data will be sufficient to support approval. Additionally, we expect a multi-center investigator-initiated trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to likely commence in the first half of 2021. 
 BA3021: We are developing our second product candidate, BA3021, a CAB antibody directed against ROR2. ROR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is also known as Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Like Orphan Receptor 2. ROR2 is overexpressed across many different solid tumors and its tumoral expression is further enhanced among those treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. ROR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is commonly overexpressed in multiple types of cancer including breast, lung, pancreatic, renal, colorectal, head and neck and melanoma. Cancer cell expression of ROR2 has been associated with enhanced cancer cell migration, EMT, increased associated risk for relapse, metastasis and unfavorable prognosis. In breast cancer, for example, ROR2 was found to be expressed in the majority of patient samples, with those expressing ROR2 having decreased overall survival. A similar correlation between ROR2 expression level and overall survival was observed in NSCLC and metastatic melanoma. Genetic inactivation of ROR2 in metastatic melanoma cells was shown to prevent metastases of these tumor cells in mice. ROR2 also has essential roles in normal cells and in early development. Inactivation of ROR2 is lethal in mice with defects observed in the heart, nervous system and skeleton. Less severe mutations in ROR2 in humans is associated with skeletal diseases Robinow syndrome and brachydactyly type B. 
 Employing a similar approach as with BA3011, we developed a TmPS quantitative assay based on ROR2 tumor membrane expression that we use to identify those patients who we believe will be the most likely to respond to our product candidates. 
 BA3021 is a CAB anti-ROR2 ADC consisting of a CAB anti-ROR2 humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to MMAE using a cleavable linker. BA3021 binds potently and specifically to ROR2 under conditions found in the tumor microenvironment. Outside of these conditions, BA3021 loses its potency in a reversible manner such that it regains its ROR2 potency when it reenters conditions similar to those in the tumor microenvironment, thereby preventing elimination of ROR2-expressing normal cells. 
 We are developing BA3021 as a potential therapeutic for multiple solid tumors, including NSCLC, ovarian cancer and melanoma. We have completed a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial with BA3021 where we observed two partial responses in advanced, treatment refractory NSCLC and one partial response in melanoma. We believe BA3021 has broad potential as a cancer therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors. We recently initiated Phase 2 enrollment in patients with PD-1 refractory NSCLC and melanoma. Additionally, we expect a multi-center investigator-initiated trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to likely commence in the first half of 2021.

 BA3071: Our third product candidate, BA3071, is a CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibody that is being developed as an immuno-oncology agent with the goal of delivering the efficacy of approved CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab, but with lower toxicities due to the CABs tumor microenvironment-restricted activation. CTLA-4, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, is an immune checkpoint involved in regulating T-cell activation. The primary role of immune checkpoints is to prevent autoimmune attacks against normal tissue in the body; however, cancer cells often take advantage of this pathway to prevent immune destruction of the tumor. Ipilimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of multiple solid tumors, including melanoma, RCC, colorectal cancer and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab in NSCLC. Patients treated with ipilimumab face a risk of a number of adverse events associated with inappropriate activation of the immune system beyond the tumor site including severe and sometimes fatal enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathy and endocrinopathy. The usage and dosage of ipilimumab is highly limited due to its safety profile, resulting in the average number of cycles on therapy not exceeding four cycles. Even in combination with nivolumab, at one-third to one-tenth of the monotherapy dosage level, treatment still results in high toxicity. 
 In a global collaboration with Beigene, we are developing BA3071 as a potential therapeutic for multiple solid tumor indications, including renal cell carcinoma, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and cervical cancer. Our global collaboration with BeiGene, as amended, provides for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of BA3071. Under the terms of our BeiGene collaboration, BeiGene is generally responsible for developing BA3071 and is responsible for global regulatory filings and commercialization. Subject to the terms of the agreement, BeiGene holds an exclusive license with us to develop and manufacture the product candidate globally. BeiGene is responsible for all costs of development, manufacturing and commercialization globally. We expect to work with our partner BeiGene to support the initiation of a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of BA3071 as monotherapy and in combination with tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody in late stage development by BeiGene, in 2021 with expansion cohorts to be enrolled upon identification of the recommended dose. 
 Bispecific antibody programs: We have also leveraged our CAB technology to develop bispecific antibodies, which bind both a tumor-specific antigen and a T cell receptor using CAB antigen-binding domains. A bispecific antibody is a type of engineered antibody that can simultaneously bind two separate and unique antigens, unlike conventional monospecific antibodies that only bind to one type of target. 
 A common design feature for a bispecific antibody is to include a T cell engager component (i.e., CD3 receptor), such that one antigen-binding domain recognizes a surface-expressed tumor antigen and the other antigen-binding domain binds to and activates CD3+ T cells. With this design, bispecific antibodies can induce potent T cell responses against tumors expressing the tumor target antigen in a simplified manner relative to even off-the-shelf or allogeneic CAR-T therapies. The first FDA approved bispecific antibody was a T cell engager, blinatumomab, which contained antigen-binding domains for CD19, an antigen found on B-cell leukemias, and CD3, a T cell activating receptor. 
 There are multiple structural variants of antibodies and other antigen-binding domains being used to construct bispecific product candidates and tested clinically. However, similar to CAR-T cells and blinatumomab, many of these bispecific product candidates have increased risks of generating life-threatening cytokine release syndrome due to systemic immune activation. 
 We have applied our CAB antibody technology to develop bispecific CAB antibodies in which one or both antigen-binding domains are activated only in the tumor microenvironment. An example of this approach is our EpCAM x CD3 bispecific. EpCAM, or epithelial cell adhesion molecule, is a protein that is over-expressed in many cancers including carcinomas derived from colon, intestine, breast, lung and prostate. Expression of EpCAM has been associated with cell growth and proliferation of both healthy and cancer cells. 
 EpCAM was one of the first cancer-associated antigens discovered, however in the forty years since, its clinical impact as a target for therapeutic antibodies in cancer has been limited. One of the problems with 
 
6 


  targeting EpCAM is its broad expression in the basolateral membranes of normal epithelial cells. Conventional approaches of avoiding systemic toxicities including deliberately selecting antibodies with low affinity for EpCAM with the intention of generating some degree of selectivity for tumors that express very high levels of EpCAM, have not been successful. Bispecific constructs targeting EpCAM have also not lived up to expectations. Solitomab, an EpCAM x CD3 bispecific led to over 95% of patients in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial to experience at least one Grade 3 or above adverse event. Over 20% of patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities and there was only one unconfirmed partial response observed among 65 patients at these low doses. 
 We have shown in preclinical experiments that our CAB bispecific molecules meet or exceed the activity of conventional bispecifics and reduce systemic activation of potentially fatal immune responses. We advanced two CAB bispecific antibody product candidates into IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2020. We are also evaluating ADC modalities for each of our CAB bispecific molecules. Our goal is to submit up to four US INDs in 2022 for our CAB bispecific or ADC molecules. 
 Our strategy 
 Our mission is to develop and commercialize innovative antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors that depend on the physical and chemical properties of tumors and their microenvironment. Our CAB technology enables us to generate antibodies that bind to their targets under conditions found in the tumor, but not in healthy tissue. Therefore, we are able to generate antibodies to targets which to this point have been undruggable due to the lack of sufficient therapeutic window with existing antibody technologies. We are also able to use these antibodies to engage targets that exist not only in tumors, but in healthy tissue as well. This has the potential to reduce side effects and toxicity, one of the fundamental challenges of cancer therapies today, thereby expanding the realm of potential therapeutic antibodies. We believe that our proprietary technology and approach have the potential to transform cancer therapy by decreasing systemic toxicities and improving efficacy. Our strategy to achieve this mission is as follows: 
 

 | Advance BA3011 through regulatory approval and commercialization. Clinical data from our Phase 1 trial with BA3011 are supportive of its development in sarcomas, a set of cancers with a high unmet clinical need. We have initiated a potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 trial for BA3011 in treatment refractory sarcoma patients (12 years of age or older) with an AXL TmPS of 70% or above and, if successful, we believe we can further advance BA3011 through regulatory approval and commercialization. In addition, we have initiated a potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 trial in NSCLC using an AXL TmPS of 50% or above. We will use a quantitative biomarker assay/TmPS score to identify likely responders and to help enrich our clinical trial programs.

 | Develop BA3021 in PD-1/L1 refractory tumors through regulatory approval and commercialization. We have observed antitumor activity in PD-1 refractory NSCLC and melanoma patients in our Phase 1 trial and have initiated a Phase 2 trial of BA3021 in each of these indications. We will use a quantitative biomarker assay/TmPS score to identify likely responders and to help enrich our clinical trial programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to capitalize on our unique technology to address areas of high unmet need in treating cancer. We believe that, through the application of our CAB technology, we have the opportunity to develop a broad set of new molecules that include bispecific T cell engagers, immuno-oncology antibodies, as well as other therapies, to attack tumors through preferential activation in the tumor microenvironment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintain and strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, we have a total of 492 patents and patent applications with 257 issued patents, 9 allowed applications and 226 pending applications covering our CAB technology and product candidates. This broad patent coverage was designed such that protection of our product candidates is not dependent on any single patent but rather, each product candidate has multiple layers of protection. We plan to continue to maintain, enforce and defend our intellectual property.

 | Selectively enter into collaborations to maximize the value of our platform and pipeline, including the existing collaboration involving BA3071. Given the potential of our technology to generate novel product candidates addressing a wide variety of solid tumors, we may opportunistically enter into strategic collaborations around specific geographic regions, indications, combinations and companion diagnostics. We may also explore collaboration arrangements to commercialize any product candidates where we believe the resources and expertise of the third party could be beneficial. These collaborations could advance and accelerate our programs to maximize their market potential and expand the worldwide commercial potential of our CAB technology.

 Challenges in developing antibody-based therapies for solid tumors 
 Monoclonal antibody therapeutics have been approved for over 30 targets for multiple diseases, most commonly cancer. Antibodies have become the new backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, which previously relied on small molecules. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies has established itself as one of the most successful therapeutic strategies for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Oncology targets of safe, effective antibodies fall into two broad categories: 
 

 | Antibodies targeting antigens, usually proteins, preferentially expressed on the surface of cancer cells, against which antibodies are used to directly bind and inhibit or destroy these cells; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Antibodies targeting antigens affecting directly or indirectly tumor cells and non-tumor cells that activate the immune system or induce other changes in the tumor, such as limiting the growth of tumor-related blood vessels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are significant limitations of targeting important antigens with traditional antibodies that can result in reduced efficacy, difficulties related to dosing and decreased durability, all of which significantly limit the potential for cures with traditional antibodies: 
 

 | Increased toxicity: Antigens are typically expressed in many normal tissues, which for traditional antibodies, including ADCs, could lead to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Target-mediated drug disposition limitation: Target-mediated drug disposition, or TMDD, is the phenomenon in which a drug binds to its pharmacological target on normal tissue, causing the antibody to attack a normal cell and depleting the antibody from circulation. As a consequence, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug can be adversely impacted, leading to reduced half-life, lower tumor exposure, which requires more frequent dosing, increased toxicity and ultimately resulting in patient inconvenience, greater costs and necessitating higher doses of the drug.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Immunogenicity: Antibodies also can be sensitive to modifications that can lead to immunogenicity, or a strong negative immune system response from the body, which can induce anti-drug antibodies that can reduce efficacy or lead to severe infusion reactions, thereby restricting the potential improvements that could be made with emerging technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The fundamental specificity challenge with traditional monoclonal antibody-based therapy is that there are few known antigens that are specific to tumors and absent in non-cancerous tissues. Drug developers might develop an antibody that is exquisitely specific against its target, but due to the expression of the target on non-tumor cells, systemic administration can result in dose-limiting toxicities from on-target, off-tumor activity. However, clinicians are able to manage the consequences of these adverse events in most hematological cancer patients. In solid tumors, therapies such as cetuximab target an antigen that is highly expressed in colorectal cancer, but is also expressed in epidermal cells throughout the body, which are not restricted in lineage or tissue, nor can be easily regenerated as in the case of cells in the hematopoietic lineage. Consequently, solid tumor treatments may often result in on-target, off-tumor toxicities that are more difficult to manage than with treatments for hematological malignancy. As an example, treatment with cetuximab results in over 80% of 
 
8 


  patients developing skin toxicities that can severely impact patients physical, psychological and social well-being and can lead to treatment discontinuation and dose reduction. 
 These examples, however, only represent antibodies where the therapeutic benefit clearly outweighs the consequences associated with the adverse events. There are many potential protein targets that do not offer such clear-cut therapeutic windows. The majority of anticancer antibody-based drug products are consequently limited to a small subset of potential tumor antigens. We believe that our novel approach to increase the selectivity of antibody-based therapeutics while maintaining their potency may have the potential to fundamentally transform the development of anticancer therapeutics and expand the universe of targets for novel antibody-based therapies. 
 CAB leverages the low pH found in the tumor microenvironment 
 The tumor microenvironment has been widely implicated in tumorigenesis because it harbors tumor cells that interact with surrounding cells through the circulatory and lymphatic systems to influence the development and progression of cancer. The tumor microenvironment has conditions distinct from the normal cellular and extracellular environments found in non-cancerous tissue, blood or other parts of a normal body. It has been long appreciated that the extracellular milieu inside and surrounding the growing tumor mass is distinct and unique. One of the most profound physicochemical differences between the tumor microenvironment and normal cellular environment is an increase in lactic acid and an associated decrease in pH in the tumor microenvironment from the normal physiological pH of about 7.4 or higher. 
 While the tumor is acidic, some of the most acidic regions of tumors can be observed at the edge of the tumors, just at the interface with the surrounding tissue or blood, according to a paper published in 2019 in the journal Cancer Research. In this study, pH low insertion peptide, or pHLIP, a peptide that is taken up by cells at a pH below 6.5, was injected into human tumor-bearing mice. While nearly all tumors took up this peptide, normal tissues did not take up this peptide except in the liver and kidney, where it was metabolized and excreted. As shown in the figure below, certain regions within the tumor and in the cells at the edge of tumors took up some of the highest concentration of the probe, indicating that these areas had pH substantially lower than 6.5. These findings are important when considering the design of therapies for solid tumors because they point to the fact that while the overall tumor is acidic, the most accessible and rapidly growing portions of tumors are likely to have some of the lowest pHs. 
 Shown below is a tumor heat map identifying the tumor cells that are surrounded by an acid microenvironment. Exploiting the established ability of pHLIP to label the membrane of cells exclusively under acidic conditions (<pH 6.5) in vivo, the cells within the acidic areas of the tumor in vivo can be identified at the histological level. Mice harboring human breast tumor xenografts were administered Cy7-labeled, or dyed, pHLIP peptide and the tumor tissues were later removed and processed for imaging. Shown on the left is a micrograph of the tumor with the cell-based segmentation data overlayed, including positional information relative to tumor edge. The degree of positivity generated in the above analysis was used to identify a 0-3+ positive cells. Note that the acidic areas extend beyond the traditional hypoxic core of the tumor into the aerobic and oxygenated cells at the invasive fronts at the tumorstroma interface in vivo. Shown on the right is the breakdown of cancer cells types that are identified by pHLIP acidic cell staining in vivo. A majority of the cells identified are oxygenated and actively replicating tumor cells, and even the non-dividing cancers cells still maintain an acidic environment.

 Tumor Heat Map 
 

Tumors are highly acidic based on the uptake of pHLIP, a pH-sensitive probe. While the entire tumor is acidic, the lowest pH cells are the replicating cells, which are glycolytic and often oxygenated, i.e., the Warburg Effect. 
 One reason for the low pH in tumors compared to normal cells is that there are distinct differences in the metabolic processes found in normal and cancer cells. Normal cells generate the energy they need primarily through the oxygen-dependent process called oxidative phosphorylation. In comparison, cancer cells have switched their mechanism of energy production preferentially to the non-oxygen-dependent process known as glycolysis, even in the presence and availability of oxygen. This process switch was first described nearly a century ago and is the basis of modern tumor screening technologies. The dependence of a tumor cell on glycolysis results in the tumor cell metabolizing up to 200 times more glucose than a healthy cell and causing the secretion of significant levels of lactic acid into the tumor microenvironment. This inherent buildup of lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to reduce immune cell function and modulate other defense mechanisms of the body, promoting tumor growth and tumor survival. The presence of lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment causes it to have a distinctly acidic pH of less than 6.8 and even lower at the tumor cell surface, a pH so low that it is rarely found in the body except in organs designed for low pH, such as the stomach, where antibodies in the blood do not access, and in special circumstances, such as cancer. In some cancers, the pH goes as low as 5.8, an extremely low level given the normal, slightly alkaline, pH in the body. The body holds its pH within a tight range around a pH of 7.4, even in the non-cancerous regions of tissues afflicted with cancer. 
 These pH differences provide a clear correlation between low pH and cancer, one that is borne out in the aforementioned experiments that measure the uptake by cells of the peptide pH tracer pHLIP. These cells are found to have high levels of lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that produces the sugar lactate, i.e., lactic acid. Lactate production and secretion are known features of glycolysis. Similarly, there is a strong correlation between the uptake of pHLIP and the expression of markers of aggressive tumor growth such as Ki67. 
 Tumors not only have characteristically low pH, which assists them in reducing the bodys immune defenses, along with acidity they also generate other aberrant conditions and secrete other chemicals and proteins into the tumor microenvironment that may stimulate tumor growth, promote the development of new blood vessels or angiogenesis, degrade surrounding tissues allowing the tumor to spread or metastasize or actively suppress detection and destruction by the immune system. In view of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and the substantial supporting scientific literature, we believe that there is an opportunity to develop cancer 
 
10 


  therapies with improved selectivity for tumors by taking advantage of changes in pH, as do our initial product candidates, as well as in the conditions and levels of temperature, pressure and chemical composition in the tumor microenvironment. 
 Our CAB technology 
 Our CABs are based on our patented protein discovery and engineering technology. We invented, developed and refined this technology which we believe selectively activates proteins and antibodies in the tumor microenvironment based on differences in local conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure or chemical composition compared to normal healthy tissue. We have shown that activation of our CAB biologics is reversible; not only are they activated due to the pH levels of the tumor microenvironment, but also, unlike prodrugs, they are reversibly inactivated when they leave the tumor microenvironment and are in a normal physiological environment. 
 Our CAB technology capitalizes on the well-established Warburg Effect that through a glycolytic process leads to an acidic external tumor microenvironment. Extracellular pH levels in tumors have been measured to be as low as pH5.8 compared to the tightly controlled, alkaline, pH7.4 of blood, with even higher pH in healthy tissues. Glycolytic metabolism is also the basis of the established PET scanning technology for cancer detection for tumor types. CAB proteins have increased binding activity as the pH in the microenvironment becomes acidic, while being inactive in normal physiological environments. We discovered a novel chemical switch mechanism involving physiological-occurring chemicals, such as bicarbonate and hydrogen sulfide. These molecules are negatively charged at physiological conditions and interact with positive charged areas on the protein surface. Under acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment they are neutralized and released from the protein surface, uniquely allowing CAB antibodies to bind to their target and attack the tumor cell. We refer to this novel physiological mechanism, used for generating CABs, as Protein-associated Chemical Switch(es) or PaCS mechanism. The ability to design conditionally active therapeutics with stronger selectivity over narrower pH ranges using the PaCS mechanism offers the opportunity to greatly enhance both the safety and potency of future therapies for solid tumors. 
 We have used and continue to leverage our patented CAB technology to screen antibody candidates for multiple characteristics. By doing so, we can evolve specific regions on the antibody that will only bind in response to environmental conditions, either enhancing or eliminating binding. Our CAB technology allows us to select antibodies that preferentially bind to the target under the conditions of interest, such as high local acidity. CAB antibodies have human or humanized antibody sequences, a characteristic that reduces the risk of immunogenicity compared to emerging technologies in the field, which is supported by both our preclinical and clinical data. 
 Our cancer antibodies have been designed to be active in the acidic, lower pH of the tumor microenvironment and inactive under the slightly alkaline pH of 7.4 found in normal physiological conditions. In a quantitative in vitro binding assay we compared a CAB antibody and a non-CAB antibody that both bind to the target AXL with matched strength of binding to the target, or affinities, when measured at pH 6.0. As shown in the figure below, binding of the CAB antibody was highly sensitive to pH with binding becoming much weaker as it approached pH 7.0 and almost undetectable at a physiological pH of 7.4. In contrast, a non-CAB antibody to AXL showed indiscriminate and experimentally equivalent binding across the entire pH range tested, including at pH 7.4 of normal cells. Our CAB development process is capable of identifying CAB antibodies with a range of sensitivities to pH.

 pH-dependent binding of CAB AXL antibodies vs. non-CAB AXL antibodies 
 

CAB antibodies have pH-dependent binding. Standard antibodies do not have pH-dependent binding in the pH range tested. 
 Low pH-dependent CAB antibodies are far less likely to bind to targets outside of tumors, resulting in antibodies generated by our CAB platform having a number of potential advantages over traditional antibodies: 
 

 | Wide therapeutic window. Reduced binding to target antigens outside of the tumor has the potential to reduce toxicities that arise from systemic exposure. We believe this may enable higher doses or increased potency to be safely delivered to patients with the potential for increased efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Opportunity to increase tumor-specific killing. The wide therapeutic window imparted by tumor-specific targeting enables CAB antibodies to be modified with cytotoxic drugs to create ADCs. Similarly, bispecific antibodies can be developed using CAB antibody domains targeting pairs of targets that direct T cells to attack the tumor, which may exhibit unacceptable toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity if constructed using traditional antibody domains.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increased drug exposure to tumors. Limited binding to targets outside of tumors allows more of the administered CAB antibodies to be available to bind to target sites in the tumor, potentially increasing the concentrations and exposure of these antibodies in tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improved pharmacokinetics. Limited binding to targets outside of tumors effectively increases their half-life in plasma. The phenomenon of TMDD is a well-known limitation facing the development of many biologics which CAB antibodies may be able to avoid.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broader universe of tumor-specific antigens that can be targeted. There are few highly prevalent tumor-specific antigens expressed on solid tumors that are not expressed at some level in normal tissues. While some targets, such as EGFR, can be targeted by traditional antibodies with an acceptable level of toxicity in a subset of patients, many other potential targets cannot. CAB antibodies with pH-dependent binding have the potential to significantly reduce the potential risk of systemic toxicities caused by expression of targets on normal tissues.

 An important emerging class of antibodies is ADCs. An ADC is a modified antibody that generally has a chemotherapy agent attached to the antibody to enable more targeted chemotherapy treatment of a tumor. 
 Unfortunately, ADCs frequently bind to targets on normal cells and lead to severe toxicities. In order to evaluate the CAB technologys ability to eliminate the on-target, off-tumor toxicities, we generated two ADCs during our preclinical testing: one using a CAB antibody to AXL and another using a traditional AXL antibody. Within three days of dosing non-human primates with the traditional ADC, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, a sign of liver toxicity, increased sharply. Dosing with the CAB ADC resulted in minimal increase in ALT, supporting that on-target, off-tumor toxicity is reduced with the CAB ADC. 
 We also observed that the plasma concentration and half-life of the CAB ADC were higher than that of the traditional ADC. We demonstrated a dose dependency of this observation, which indicates that the primary driver of this absence of TMDD effect with CAB ADC is due to the reduced binding of the CAB ADC to AXL outside of the tumor microenvironment. 
 Our CAB technology has been studied in robust Phase 1 clinical trials for our two leading clinical programs, which have shown the following: 
 

 | Objective antitumor responses: We observed multiple confirmed partial clinical responses (at least 30% reduction in tumor size for at least two consecutive time points) in our Phase 1 data for both BA3011 and BA3021, including in one patient tumor volume shrinkage of more than 90%, and several patients who are presently continuing on therapy without tumor progression.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Antitumor activity correlates with a proprietary biomarker: The presence of the relevant target on a high percentage of tumor cells appeared to correlate with increased antitumor activity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Safety and tolerability: BA3011 and BA3021 were generally well-tolerated at the recommended Phase 2 dose range, which is positively differentiated from both preclinical and cross-trial trial results for a similar non-CAB ADC. Side effects have been generally manageable with our CAB ADC product candidates, with some patients able to receive more than a year of treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through the use of our proprietary technology, we have developed CAB antibodies, which we believe have specificity for tumors, while avoiding binding to the same antigen target expressed on many normal tissues. This allows us to develop therapeutics against targets that are expressed at high levels on tumors cells but are also present on normal cells and tissues, without the toxicities associated with traditional antibodies. While our lead product candidates primarily exploit the differences in pH between the tumor microenvironment and healthy tissue, there is a potential for other yet to be identified PaCS molecules in disease related microenvironments, whether controlled through pH, concentration, or other molecular characteristics (intra- or intermolecularly) for enhancing a drugs therapeutic index. Potential new therapeutic candidates addressing these opportunities are not limited to antibodies, but may also include small molecules, encompassing lipids, sugars and nucleic acid-based agents or drugs. Further, it is expected that PaCS protein-chemical systems are important naturally occurring regulatory systems linked to a range of disease-related microenvironments, including cancer, inflammation and cellular senescence. 
 Clinical trials 
 BA3011 
 BA3011 Phase 1 clinical trial 
 We have completed a Phase 1 trial of BA3011 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and NSCLC who were refractory or resistant to standard therapies. As shown below, cohorts were treated with doses of BA3011 ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W) or doses ranging from 1.2 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg twice every three weeks on days 1 and 8 (2Q3W). As of the last data 
 
13 


  cut-off 55 subjects were enrolled into 9 dose cohorts: 0.3 mg/kg Q3W (3 subjects), 0.6 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 1.2 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 1.8 mg/kg Q3W (9 subjects), 2.4 mg/kg Q3W (9 subjects), 3.0 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 1.2 mg/kg 2Q3W (7 subjects), 1.5 mg/kg 2Q3W (4 subjects) and 1.8 mg/kg 2Q3W (20 subjects). The solid tumor types enrolled in this study were: soft tissue sarcoma (19 subjects), pancreatic (12 subjects), NSCLC (4 subjects), colorectal (4 subjects), melanoma (3 subjects), bladder (2 subjects), endometrial (2 subjects), non-TNBC, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, myoepithelial carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, small cell lung, renal cell carcinoma and mesothelioma of the pleura (1 subject each). 
 The main goals of this trial were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BA3011 in solid tumor patients. Based upon the overall safety and response rates, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 1.8 mg/kg delivered every two weeks (Q2W). The trials objectives were the following: 
 Primary 
 

 | To define the safety profile, including dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT, and determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and/or the recommend Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, and other safety parameters for BA3011 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondary 
 

 | To assess antitumor activity of BA3011 including endpoints such as objective response, or OR, change from baseline in tumor size, duration of response, or DoR, disease control, time-to-response, and overall response rate, or ORR, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.

 Design of the BA3011 Phase 1 trial 
 

Based on the Phase 1 trial of BA3011, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 1.8 mg/kg delivered every two weeks. As of the last data cut-off, 55 patients have been dosed with BA3011. 
 
14 


 Antitumor activity 
 We evaluated OR, one of our secondary endpoints, as shown in the figure below. We have observed five confirmed partial responses (a reduction of at least 30% in the size of the tumor), four in patients with sarcomas and one with NSCLC. These responses have been shown to be durable (³8 months; duration of response is one of our secondary endpoints). Further, additional patients have experienced prolonged progression-free intervals, a period of time where the existing tumor did not measurably increase in size by more than 20% and no new tumors were known to develop. The toxicities observed were consistent with those described with MMAE-based ADCs and were well-tolerated at exposures planned for Phase 2. Importantly we have not observed adverse events that appeared to be related to on-target injury of normal, AXL expressing tissues, i.e., on-target, off-tumor toxicity.
Percent change in sum of target lesions by visit and AXL for all patients 
 

Antitumor response over time by AXL expression for patients enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation trial of BA3011 (a variety of tumor types were included). 
 We developed and CLIA-validated (the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, establishes federal quality standards for laboratory testing) an AXL immunohistochemical assay to quantify the level of target expression on the tumor membrane and cytoplasm. An independent board-certified pathologist scored all samples according to the scoring scheme determined by us during the CLIA validation phase, as well as during the Phase 1 trial. The pathologist determined the percent of tumor cells with positive membrane staining referred to as the TmPS. 
 We observed that approximately 57% of sarcoma patients screened for enrollment had an AXL TmPS of 70% or above (from a scale of 0% to 100%), as shown in the figure below. In addition, we identified a correlation between the expression of AXL on the membrane of tumor cells and the observed antitumor clinical response. Eight of 10 patients with a confirmed AXL TmPS of 70% or above who were dosed with 1.8 mg/kg of BA3011 Q3W or 2Q3W had a reduction in tumor volume from baseline (one of our secondary endpoints) and five patients of these eight achieved a confirmed partial response. Only two patients whose tumors expressed AXL with a TmPS of 70% or above did not respond to treatment. One of these was a pancreatic cancer patient with very advanced disease at time of trial entry and the other was a leiomyosarcoma patient for whom the archived tissue biopsy sample had been provided from a resection that was performed over one year prior to trial entry and thus may not have accurately represented AXL expression by tumor at the time of treatment. 
 
15 


 Best response for patients with TmPS of 70% or above administered 1.8mg/kg Q3W or 2Q3W 
 

At a dose of 1.8mg/kg Q3W or 2Q3W; Five patients with an AXL TmPS ³70% achieved a partial response. Eight out of 10 patients with an AXL TmPS ³70% experienced a reduction in tumor volume. 
 Focusing on the sarcoma patient subset, we observed a correlation of the AXL TmPS and antitumor response. As shown below, five out of six patients with multiple subtypes of sarcoma who were dosed with 1.8 mg/kg Q3W or 2Q3W of BA3011 with TmPS ³70% experienced reductions in tumor volume and four of these five patients achieved confirmed partial responses (observed response for at least two consecutive time points). We intend to confirm this observed correlation and the TmPS cut-off of 70% or more in Phase 2. 
 
16 


 Best response for sarcoma patients with confirmed TmPS of 70% or above administered 1.8mg/kg Q3W or 2Q3W 
 

At a dose of 1.8mg/kg Q3W or 2Q3W; 5 out of 6 sarcoma patients with an AXL TmPS ³70% experienced a reduction in tumor volume and 4 out of 6 achieved a partial response. 
 One patient with leiomyosarcoma who had experienced failure of multiple prior treatments had a 37% reduction in tumor volume while receiving 1.8 mg/kg Q3W BA3011, as shown in the figure below. The figure below reflects the patient noted in blue in the figure above. After over a year of treatment with BA3011, the residual tumor mass was reduced to a sufficient degree, enabling a successful surgical resection.

 CT scan of leiomyosarcoma patient after BA3011 treatment 
 

CT scan of a 70 mm leiomyosarcoma tumor which decreased in size with BA3011 treatment (confirmed PR) and after a year of therapy was removed by surgical resection. 
 Of the four patients with NSCLC enrolled in our Phase 1 clinical trial, two were AXL negative with a TmPS of 0%, one was not evaluable, and one was AXL positive with a TmPS of 80%. Prior to BA3011 treatment, the AXL positive patient with stage IV adenocarcinoma experienced failure from prior treatments, including treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). As shown below, this patient experienced a partial response characterized by approximately 70% tumor shrinkage with BA3011 delivered at 1.8 mg/kg on days 1 and 8, every three weeks (2Q3W). 
 All evaluable NSCLC patients enrolled in Phase 1 BA3011 trial 
 


18 


 One of four NSCLC patients enrolled in the Phase 1 BA3011 trial had a partial response. This patient was the only patient with an AXL TmPS ³70%. 
 We have not yet evaluated certain of our secondary endpoints such as ORR, disease control or time-to-response. Because this clinical trial is a single arm clinical trial, none of the endpoints, including those related to antitumor activity, can be tested for statistical significance. 
 Safety 
 BA3011 was generally well-tolerated. We have not observed adverse events that appear to be related to on-target injury of normal, AXL-expressing tissues. We believe that toxicities observed at the maximally tolerated dose and lower were manageable and off-target effects of free MMAE were consistent with those described with other marketed MMAE-based ADCs. The estimated half-life of BA3011 was approximately four days, which is twice the 1.9-day half-life reported for enapotamab vedotin, a non-CAB ADC targeting AXL. We believe this difference may be due to the decreased TMDD resulting from the lack of binding of BA3011 to AXL outside of tumors. 
 In the Phase 1 trial, the Grade 3 or greater adverse events, or AEs, or serious adverse events, or SAEs, deemed related to BA3011 were consistent with MMAE-based toxicity and could generally be classified as either reversible myelosuppression (AEs: neutropenia and anemia), transient liver enzyme elevations (AEs: AST/ALT increased) or metabolic disturbances (AEs: hyponatremia, hypokalemia). There was a total of 19 (34.5%) patients who experienced an SAE, 8 (14.5%) of which were considered related to treatment. At the anticipated Phase 2 exposure level (1.8mg/kg Q2W), BA3011 was well tolerated with few patients having treatment-related Grade 3-4 AEs (for 1.8 mg 1Q3W: 22% (2/9), vomiting and neutrophil count decrease; for 1.8 mg 2Q3W: 30% (6/20), neutropenia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, anemia, neutropenia, blood bilirubin increase and lipase increase). Few patients had SAEs (1.8mg/kg Q3W: 4 SAEs (44%; neutrophil count decrease, intestinal obstruction, lower limb fracture, and sepsis caused by E. coli); 1.8mg/kg 2Q3W: 8 SAEs (40%; pyrexia, lipase increased, hyponatremia, syncope, corneal perforation, hypercalcaemia, gastritis and edema of lower extremities) and of these SAEs, even fewer were deemed related to treatment by the investigator (1.8mg/kg Q3W: 1 SAE (11.1%; neutrophil count decrease); 1.8mg/kg 2Q3W: 3 SAEs (15%; pyrexia, lipase increased and hyponatremia). None of the related AEs or SAEs led to treatment discontinuation.

 We believe that our CAB AXL ADC, BA3011, compares favorably to enapotamab vedotin, a non-CAB AXL ADC with regard to safety and key pharmacokinetic properties. Comparing across the two Phase 1 trials, both ADCs: (i) were designed to deliver 4 MMAE molecules per antibody (DAR4 loading), (ii) employed similar 
 
19 


  ADC doses and (iii) enrolled comparable patients with advanced cancer who had experienced treatment failure of prior regimens (see figure below). As a key difference, BA3011 was designed to only bind to the AXL target expressed by tumor while enapotamab vedotin would be anticipated to bind to the AXL target throughout the body. 
 Notably, the estimated half-life of BA3011 was approximately four days, which is twice the 1.9-day half-life reported for enapotamab vedotin. We believe this difference may be due to the decreased TMDD resulting from the lack of binding of BA3011 to AXL outside of tumors. With respect to reported toxicity comparisons, constipation is believed to be an on-target delivery of MMAE to normal gut tissues that express the AXL target. Despite including a risk mitigation plan in enapotamab vedotins trial protocol (a prophylactic stool-softener medication in all patients), the clinical data presented at ASCO 2019 showed that AEs of constipation Grade 1-2 were reported in 49% of the patients and Grade 3-4 in 9% of patients. The rate of constipation reported with BA3011 (16% Grade 1-2 and 4% Grade 3-4) was approximately 2 to 3-fold lower for both Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4 TAEs. While supportive of a reduced toxicity benefit from CAB technology, these comparisons are derived from cross-trial analyses, and would not be included as part of our labeling. 
 Adverse events, such as peripheral neuropathy, are commonly seen with other ADCs and may be due to free circulating MMAE. Clinical data presented at ASCO 2019 for enapotamab vedotin showed that 38% of the patients had peripheral neuropathy (all Grades) with 2 patients reporting Grade 3-4 AEs. The rate of peripheral neuropathy (all Grade) reported for BA3011 (18%) was approximately half the rate reported with enapotamab vedotin and is believed to be due to the advantageous pharmacokinetic characteristics of a CAB ADC vs. a non-CAB ADC.
At a dose of 2.4 mg/kg Q3W BA3011, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities: one with Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and the other with Grade 4 hyperglycemia. Dosing continued at the 2.4 mg/kg with prophylactic administration of pegfilgrastim without any additional dose limiting toxicities. Dosing above 2.4 mg/kg was terminated due to one patient who experienced Grade 4 febrile neutropenia and cardio-respiratory arrest at 3 mg/kg likely related to delayed hepatic and renal excretion of MMAE.

 Clinical development plans 
 We have initiated a Phase 2, potentially registration-enabling trial with BA3011, enrolling soft-tissue and bone sarcoma patients, with interim analysis anticipated in 2021 and the complete registrational data set expected in 2022. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 2 trial in NSCLC with BA3011 as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in patients who have experienced prior disease progression on a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and have a TmPS of 50% or greater. The FDA has reviewed the trial designs, but has not opined on whether Phase 2 clinical trials will in fact be sufficient to support regulatory approval. However, the FDA is expected to consider this further at the interim data review point. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree that such data will be sufficient to support approval. A summary of our clinical development plan for BA3011 is below. 
 Additionally, we expect a multi-center investigator-initiated trial of BA3011 led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group, or CCTG, in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients that will likely commence in the first half of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan for BA3011, which includes multiple Phase 2 trials 
 

BA3011 sarcoma Phase 2 trial design: 
 This Phase 2 trial is an open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BA3011 alone and in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in adult and adolescent patients with AXL-expressing TmPS ³ 70%, and advanced, refractory sarcoma who have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1 criteria and have documented progression according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria within the six months prior to enrollment. To enroll, patients must either be ineligible for chemotherapy or have received at least one regimen containing anthracycline and a maximum of three previous lines of systemic therapy for metastatic disease (no more than two lines of combination regimens), including pazopanib, trabectedin, eribulin mesylate or tazemetostat, if applicable, per regional prescribing information. Patients who meet enrollment criteria will be assigned to receive either BA3011 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent (for patients 18 years old and above: 240 mg every two weeks (Q2W); for patients 12-17 years old: 3 mg/kg Q2W IV infusion). Patients with tumors showing B-cell infiltration (per immunohistochemistry, or IHC, assay) will be preferentially assigned to receive BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent. Based on data from the Phase 1 part of the trial, the dose of BA3011 for Phase 2 is 1.8 mg/kg Q2W. 
 
21 


 Enrollment will be staged, beginning with approximately 10 patients per sarcoma subtype in the monotherapy arm. Up to seven sarcoma subtype groups may be enrolled: 
 Soft tissue sarcoma: 
 

 | Leiomyosarcoma
--+---------------


 | Synovial sarcoma
--+-----------------


 | Liposarcoma
--+------------


 | All other soft tissue sarcomas, except gastro intestinal stromal tumors, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and malignant mesothelioma
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bone sarcoma: 
 

 | Osteosarcoma
--+-------------


 | Ewing sarcoma
--+--------------


 | Other bone sarcomas, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and chondrosarcoma
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the combination arm (BA3011 with an anti-PD-1 agent) of the study, 20 patients of any sarcoma subtype will be enrolled. Among these 20 patients, approximately 10 patients will have a tumor showing B-cell infiltration and 10 patients will not. 
 Tumor assessment will occur approximately every 6 weeks from cycle 1 day 1 of treatment, or C1D1, until 12 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity and biomarker assessments will also be performed at various time points. 
 An interim analysis will be conducted for each subtype or treatment (i.e., BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in patients with tumors with B cell infiltration or BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in patients with tumors without B cell infiltration) after at least 10 patients in the subtype or treatment have the potential to be followed for at least 12 weeks after the initiation of investigational product. Following interim analysis, accrual to the subtype or to a treatment (i.e., BA3011 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) may be put on hold if the number of patients with a response (i.e., confirmed or unconfirmed complete response or partial response) and progression-free rate at 12 weeks are below a pre-defined threshold. Approximately 150 additional patients may be enrolled for sarcoma subtypes that meet the threshold. The accrual of patients to a specific subtype or to one or both treatment regimen(s) (i.e., BA3011 alone and/or BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) can be put on hold at any time based on evaluation of available data or by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, at any time upon review of safety data. Treatment for all enrolled patients will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
 BA3011 NSCLC Phase 2 trial design: 
 This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BA3011 alone and in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in patients with AXL-expressing TmPS³50%, metastatic NSCLC who have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria and have documented progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria within the 6 months prior to enrollment. To enroll, patients must have prior disease progression on a PD-1/L-1 inhibitor (either monotherapy or in combination with another therapy such as ipilimumab). Patients with EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations should have had disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. 
 Patients who meet enrollment criteria will be assigned to receive either BA3011 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent (240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)). For the first 20 patients (Part 1), treatment assignment 
 
22 


  will be determined by the sponsor and the medical monitor based on the patients prior experience with PD-1/L1 treatment. To be eligible for the PD-1 combination arm, patients must have acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment. In Part 2, up to approximately 200 additional patients may be enrolled depending on observed efficacy at interim analysis. If both monotherapy and combination therapy are further pursued post interim analysis, patients that have acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment will be randomized 1:1 to receive either BA3011 alone or BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent. Randomization will be stratified according to histology (squamous vs. non-squamous) and the number of prior systemic regimens (< 2 vs. < 3). Patients that have not acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment will be assigned to the BA3011 monotherapy arm of the study. Based on data from the Phase 1 study, the dose of BA3011 for Phase 2 is 1.8 mg/kg Q2W. A dose reduction to 1.5 mg/kg Q2W may be implemented if deemed warranted by the IDMC. 
 Tumor assessment will occur approximately every 6 weeks from C1D1 until 12 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity and biomarker assessments will be performed at various time points. 
 An interim analysis will be conducted after at least 20 patients (10 patients on BA3011 monotherapy arm and 10 patients in the BA3011 an anti-PD-1 agent combination arm) have the potential to be followed for at least 12 weeks after the initiation of investigational product. Following interim analysis, accrual to a treatment (i.e., BA3011 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) may be put on hold if the number of patients with a response (i.e., confirmed or unconfirmed complete response or partial response) are below a pre-defined threshold. Depending on observed efficacy at the interim analysis, additional NSCLC patients may be enrolled for a total of up to approximately 200 patients (100 patients in each of the 2 treatment groups) with AXL-expressing, metastatic NSCLC. The accrual of patients to one or both treatment regimen(s) (i.e., BA3011 alone and/or BA3011 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) can be put on hold at any time based on evaluation of available data. Treatment for all enrolled patients will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
 BA3021 
 BA3021 Phase 1 clinical trial 
 We have completed the dose escalation part of a Phase 1 clinical trial of BA3021 in patients with locally-advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors including NSCLC and melanoma, who were refractory or resistant to standard therapies. As shown below, cohorts were treated with doses of BA3021 ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 3.3 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W) or doses ranging from 1.5 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg twice every three weeks on days 1 and 8 (2Q3W). As of the data cut-off date, 59 subjects were enrolled into 9 dose cohorts: 0.3 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 0.6 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 1.2 mg/kg Q3W (1 subject), 1.8 mg/kg Q3W (3 subjects), 2.4 mg/kg Q3W (16 subjects), 3.0 mg/kg Q3W (19 subject), 3.3 mg/kg Q3W (5 subjects), 1.2 mg/kg 2Q3W (3 subjects), 1.5 mg/kg 2Q3W (3 subjects), and 1.8 mg/kg 2Q3W (7 subjects). The solid tumor types enrolled in this study were: soft tissue sarcoma (40 subjects), NSCLC (6 subjects), melanoma (2 subjects), pancreatic (2 subjects), non-TNBC (2 subjects), colorectal, TNBC, GIST, urachus, ampulla of vatter, rectal carcinoid and head and neck (1 subject each). 
 The main goals of this trial were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of BA3021 in solid tumor patients. Based upon the overall safety and response rates, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 1.8 mg/kg delivered every two weeks (Q2W). The trials objectives were the following: 
 Primary 
 

 | To define the safety profile, including DLT, and determine the MTD and/or RP2D and other safety parameters for BA3021 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 


 Secondary 
 

 | To assess antitumor activity of BA3021 including endpoints such as OR, DoR, disease control, time-to-response, and ORR, according to RECIST Version 1.1.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | To assess the pharmacokinetics of BA3021.
--+------------------------------------------


 | To evaluate the immunogenicity of BA3021.
--+------------------------------------------

 As shown below, cohorts were treated with doses of BA3021 ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 3.3 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W) or doses ranging from 1.5 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg twice every three weeks on days 1 and 8 (2Q3W). 
 Design of the BA3021 Phase 1 trial in solid tumor patients 
 

Based on the Phase 1 trial of BA3021, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 1.8 mg/kg Q2W. To date, 59 patients have been dosed with BA3021. 
 Antitumor activity 
 We evaluated OR, one of our secondary endpoints, as shown in the figure below. At various dose levels, treatment with BA3021 has resulted in a total of four partial responses: 2 among patients with NSCLC (~31% and ~49% tumor reduction), 1 in a patient with metastatic melanoma (~80% tumor reduction) and 1 in a patient with advanced head and neck cancer (~54% tumor reduction).

 Of the six NSCLC patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase, two patients achieved a durable partial response (duration of response is one of our secondary endpoints) and a third experienced tumor reduction to a lesser degree (change from baseline in tumor size is one of our secondary endpoints, as shown below). Similar to the observed correlation of antitumor activity with higher levels of tumoral membrane AXL expression, as shown below, the two NSCLC patients with partial responses to BA3021 had ROR2 TmPS of at least 70%. We were not able to characterize ROR2 TmPS for the third patient who also experienced tumor shrinkage. Another patient with late stage NSCLC and bone metastases and a ROR2 TmPS of 100%, treated with a suboptimal dose of BA3021 (1.2mg/kg 2Q3W), experienced tumor shrinkage prior to progression of their metastatic bone lesions. All NSCLC patients who enrolled in this trial had previously been treated with PD-1 therapy.

Tumor membrane expression of ROR2 was associated with antitumor response in two of the five NSCLC patients with evaluable ROR2 TmPS 
 Two metastatic melanoma patients were enrolled in the initial part of the trial, as shown below. The patient in whom we were not able to characterize ROR2 surface expression achieved a durable partial response (duration of response is one of our secondary endpoints). This patient, who had previously experienced failure of both nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab, achieved an approximate 80% reduction in tumor volume and presently continues on BA3021 therapy for now more than a year. 
 
25 


 All evaluable metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in BA3021 Phase 1 trial by ROR2 TmPS 
 

One of two melanoma patients enrolled in the BA3021 Phase 1 dose escalation trial achieved a partial response. 
 The metastatic melanoma patient who achieved a partial response experienced clearance of metastatic lung lesions. Illustrated below is one of the two lung lesions that cleared. Moreover, a pretreatment biopsy of an involved, abnormally enlarged cervical lymph node showed active melanoma. Subsequently, an on-treatment biopsy of the same node demonstrated no evidence of melanoma.

26 


 In addition, one head and neck cancer patient achieved a durable partial response with a 54% reduction in tumor size. 
 We have not yet evaluated certain of our secondary endpoints such as ORR, disease control or time-to-response. Because this clinical trial is a single arm clinical trial, none of the endpoints, including those related to antitumor activity, can be tested for statistical significance. 
 Safety 
 Similar to BA3011, BA3021 was generally well-tolerated. We have not observed adverse events that appear to be related to on-target injury of normal, ROR2-expressing tissues. We believe that reported toxicities were consistent with off-target effects of free MMAE consistent with those described with other marketed MMAE-based ADCs. 
 In the Phase 1 trial, the Grade 3 or greater AEs or SAEs deemed related to BA3021 were consistent with MMAE-based toxicity and could generally be classified as either reversible myelosuppression (AEs: neutropenia, anemia), transient liver enzyme elevations (AEs: AST/ALT increased) or metabolic disturbances (AEs: hyponatremia, hypokalemia). There was a total of 23 (39%) patients who experienced an SAE, 11 (18.6%) of which were serious TEAEs that were considered related to treatment. At the anticipated Phase 2 exposure levels (1.8mg/kg Q2W), BA3021 was well tolerated with few patients having treatment-related Grade 3-4 AEs (for 1.8 mg 1Q3W: 33.3% (1/3) anemia; for 1.8 mg 2Q3W: 42.9% (3/7) fatigue, hyponatremia and hyperglycemia) and few patients having SAEs (1.8mg/kg Q3W: 0 SAE (0%); 1.8mg/kg 2Q3W: 3 SAEs (43%; infected biloma, pyrexia and hyperglycemia). Out of these SAEs, 2 (28.6%) were deemed related to treatment by the investigator (1.8mg/kg Q3W: 0 SAEs (0%); 1.8mg/kg 2Q3W: 2 SAEs (28.6%; pyrexia and hyperglycemia). None of the related AEs or SAEs led to treatment discontinuation.

 At a dose of 3mg/kg Q3W, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities: one with Grade 3 dyspnea (self-resolved without intervention) and the other with Grade 4 febrile neutropenia (in a subject that did not receive prophylactic pegfilgrastim as directed) which resolved on day 2 of hospitalization. 
 Clinical development plans 
 We have initiated a potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 trial for BA3021 monotherapy or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in melanoma and NSCLC patients that have experienced prior disease progression on a PD1/L1 inhibitor and have a ROR2 TmPS of 50% or more. However, we have not discussed with the FDA whether the Phase 2 clinical trials will in fact be sufficient to support regulatory approval and we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree that such data will be sufficient to support approval. We intend to perform an interim analysis when 20 evaluable patients in each indication have the potential to be followed for at 
 
27 


  least 12 weeks, which we expect to occur in the second half of 2021. Results from these analyses will drive the decision to expand enrollment in each indication to up to 200 patients, and we expect final registration data in 2022. 
 Additionally, we expect a multi-center investigator-initiated trial of BA3021 led by CCTG in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients that will likely commence in the first half of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan for BA3021, which includes two Phase 2 indications 
 

Clinical development plan for BA3021 includes two Phase 2 indications. 
 BA3021 Phase 2 trial design in NSCLC and Melanoma 
 This Phase 2 trial is an open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BA3021 alone and in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent in patients with ROR2-expressing TmPS ³ 50% and metastatic NSCLC or melanoma who have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1 criteria and have documented progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria within the 6 months prior to enrollment. 
 Patients who meet enrollment criteria will be assigned to receive either BA3021 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent (240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)). For the first 20 patients (10 patients in each of the 2 indications) (Part 1), treatment assignment will be determined by the sponsor and the medical monitor based on the patients prior experience with PD-1/L1 treatment. To be eligible for the PD-1 combination arm, patients must have acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment. In Part 2, up to approximately 200 additional patients per indication may be enrolled depending on observed efficacy at interim analysis. For each indication, if both monotherapy and combination therapy are further pursued post interim analysis, patients that have acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment will be randomized 1:1 to receive either BA3021 alone or BA3021 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent. For the NSCLC indication, randomization will be stratified according to histology (squamous vs. non-squamous) and the number of prior systemic regimens (< 2 vs. < 3). For the melanoma indication, randomization will be stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 vs. 1 and the number of prior systemic regimens (< 2 vs. < 3). For both indications, patients that have not acceptably tolerated prior PD-1/L1 treatment will be assigned to the BA3021 monotherapy arm of the study. Based on data from the Phase 1 part of the study, the dose of BA3021 for Phase 2 is 1.8 mg/kg Q2W. A dose reduction to 1.5 mg/kg Q2W may be implemented if deemed warranted by the IDMC. 
 Tumor assessment will occur approximately every 6 weeks from C1D1 until 12 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity and biomarker assessments will be performed at various time points. 
 For each indication, an interim analysis will be conducted after at least 20 patients (10 patients in each treatment group) have the potential to be followed for at least 12 weeks after the initiation of investigational 
 
28 


  product. Following interim analysis, accrual to a treatment (i.e., BA3021 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) may be put on hold if the number of patients with a response (i.e., confirmed or unconfirmed complete response or partial response) are below a pre-defined threshold. Depending on observed efficacy at the interim analysis, additional NSCLC and/or melanoma patients may be enrolled for a total of up to approximately 200 patients (100 patients in each of the 2 treatment groups) with ROR2-expressing, metastatic NSCLC and a total of up to approximately 200 patients with ROR2-expressing, metastatic melanoma. The accrual of patients to a treatment regimen(s) (i.e., BA3021 alone and/or BA3021 in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent) can be put on hold by the sponsor at any time based on evaluation of available data or by the IDMC at any time upon review of safety data. Treatment for all enrolled patients will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
 BA3071 
 BA3071 preclinical studies 
 In a mouse colon adenocarcinoma, or MC38, xenograft model in which the human CTLA-4 gene had been introduced, we found that BA3071 had similar antitumor efficacy as a traditional anti-CTLA-4 antibody that is an analog of ipilimumab, or an Ipi-analog. As shown below, BA3071 led to equivalent tumor regression to ipilimumab out of eight treated mice and in two instances we saw a complete response, or no detectable tumor remaining. 
 Efficacy in human CTLA-4 engineered mouse model 
 

BA3071 had potent antitumor activity and led to two complete responses in an MC38 tumor cell line model in mice containing the human CTLA-4 gene.
As shown below, examination of the immune cell composition of treated tumors found that those treated with either of two CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibodies had increased numbers of CD8 T cells than IgG control mice. CD8 T cells are effector cells that mediate tumor cell killing. These levels were similar to those observed in tumors treated with the ipilimumab analog.

CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibodies functioned similar to ipilimumab in stimulating CD8 T cells in tumors 
 In contrast, the CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibodies did not lead to changes in the T cell subsets in peripheral blood, as set forth in the figure below. The percentage of CD4 effector cells in CAB-treated mice were similar to those observed with the controls. The percentage of CD4 effector cells in ipilimumab analog-treated mice more than doubled, consistent with systemic inhibition of the CTLA-4 checkpoint. We believe that the observed tumor-restricted activity of CAB anti-CTLA4 antibodies will be associated with fewer systemic target-based toxicities.

Unlike the ipilimumab analog, CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibodies did not lead to stimulation of T cells in peripheral blood 
 Safety 
 Our preclinical toxicity study of BA3071 in non-human primates compares its safety profile to that of ipilimumab. Specifically, as shown in the figure below, we examined the gastrointestinal toxicities associated with combination therapy with nivolumab. To examine toxicities, these animals were dosed with high levels of both agents. Dosing of non-human primates with BA3071 in combination with nivolumab was associated with fewer occurrences of events associated with gastrointestinal toxicity than the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. These animals received 20 mg/kg nivolumab, which represents 12 times the human dose, and either 
 
30 


  15 mg/kg of ipilimumab or 15 mg/kg of BA3071, which we estimate is 45 to 60 times the current human dose. There were 33 gastrointestinal events such as liquid feces, non-formed feces and other gastrointestinal symptoms in the ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination across 29 days and five animals. There was only a single case of liquid feces in one animal on one day in the BA3071 plus nivolumab treatment group. 
 Toxicity study of BA3071 comparing its safety profile to ipilimumab 
 

Treatment of non-human primates with a combination of BA3071 and nivolumab resulted in fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. 
 These results were consistent with the preclinical results shown two and three figures above that demonstrated that CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibodies had insignificant target-based activity outside of tumors. We believe that this non-human primate study provides support for assessing the safety and tolerability of BA3071 in clinical trials. We anticipate that BA3071 will have a wider therapeutic window than ipilimumab, which may enable it to be better tolerated when used in combination with nivolumab, with the potential to further increase efficacy by allowing administration of higher doses. 
 Clinical development plans 
 We obtained U.S. IND in November 2019, and we plan to work with our partner BeiGene to initiate a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of BA3071 in advanced solid tumor patients in 2021. We expect this trial will examine the safety and tolerability of BA3071 at doses ranging from 7mg Q3W to 700mg Q3W (equivalent to 10mg/kg of ipilimumab) as monotherapy and in combination with tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody in late-stage development by BeiGene. 
 Bispecific candidates 
 Bispecific candidates preclinical studies 
 BA3182  EpCAM x CD3 
 We examined the antitumor potential of multiple EpCAM x CD3 bispecific candidates, including some with a conventional EpCAM binding domain, a CAB CD3 binding domain and others with both binding domains with 
 
31 


  CAB activity. Dosage was 2.5mg per kilogram twice per week in mice, which is roughly equivalent to 0.625 mg per kilogram in non-human primates. As shown below, we found that all of these constructs had potent antitumor activity in a HCT116, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, xenograft model in mice with a humanized immune system. All of the EpCAM x CD3 bispecifics, including those with CAB antigen binding domains, resulted in tumor shrinkage. 
 Xenograft model for multiple EpCAM x CD3 bispecific candidates 
 

EpCAM x CD3 bispecific antibodies all had potent antitumor activity in a xenograft model, regardless of whether the antigen-binding domains were from CAB or conventional antibodies. 
 Safety 
 While there was no observable difference in antitumor efficacy between antibodies with CAB domains and those with conventional antigen-binding domains, a conventional EpCAM x CD3 bispecific antibody led to a much higher level of systemic immune activation than an EpCAM x CAB CD3 bispecific antibody in non-human primates. As shown below, at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg, the plasma level of interleukin 6, or IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine associated with cytokine release syndrome, was elevated above baseline in primates treated with a conventional bispecific with no detectable increase in the CAB bispecific-antibody-treated primates. Doubling the dose to 0.05 mg/kg led to a further increase in IL-6 production in conventional bispecific treated primates with significant gastrointestinal and renal toxicities and the death of one of two treated primates. Only a minor increase in IL-6 was observed with the CAB bispecific antibody and both treated primates were healthy. An increase in dose to 0.25 mg/kg resulted in a large increase in IL-6 levels in primates treated with the conventional bispecific and the death of both animals. In contrast, 0.25 mg/kg of the CAB bispecific antibody led to a much lower level of IL-6 and no deaths. 
 
32 


 Systemic immune activation of EpCAM x CAB CD3 bispecific antibody vs. conventional EpCAM x CD3 bispecific antibody 
 

EpCAM x CAB CD3 bispecific antibodies led to much lower expression of IL-6 in non-human primates than conventional EpCAM x BF3 bispecific antibodies 
 BA3142  B7-H3 x CD3 
 Our second bispecific product candidate, BA3142, is a dual-CAB T-cell engager targeting B7-H3, a protein expressed on many solid tumors. The lead molecule was characterized by multiple assays including functional assays, as well as a pharyngeal cancer model. The lead molecule showed antitumor activity comparable to a non-CAB antibody, while demonstrating lower binding activity under normal physiological conditions, as expected for a CAB bispecific antibody. Cell line development was initiated in Q4 2020. 
 EGFR x CD3 
 Targeting EGFR with a CAB bispecific antibody is expected to provide benefit since the target is widely expressed in healthy tissue, such as skin, which would otherwise result in on-target, off-tumor toxicity if targeted by a non-CAB antibody. A set of lead molecules were characterized by multiple assays including functional assays and all demonstrated high binding activity at acidic pH with little to no binding under normal physiological conditions. Studies, using a colorectal cancer model, to select the clinical lead are in progress and are expected to be completed in 2021. 
 Nectin-4 x CD3 
 Nectin-4 is widely expressed and has adhesive roles in normal tissues. A set of lead molecules were characterized by multiple assays including functional assays. Lead candidates were selected based on the overall performance in these assays and based on their pH profile (i.e., high binding under tumor conditions and little or no binding under normal physiological conditions).
 Studies, using a lung cancer model, to select the clinical lead are in progress and are expected to be completed in 2021. 
 Clinical Development Plans 
 We have advanced two CAB bispecific antibody product candidates, BA3182 and BA3142, into IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2020 chosen from a number of preclinical candidates. This includes an EpCAM x CD3 as well as a B7-H3 x CD3 bispecific antibody. 
 
33 


 Additionally, two bispecific antibody product candidates (EGFR x CD3 and Nectin-4 x CD3) have reached the late discovery stage of development and we anticipate they have the potential to reach the IND enabling studies stage by 2021. We expect to submit multiple U.S. INDs in the second half of 2021 or sometime in 2022. We believe that our CAB technology opens up the opportunity for the creation of a broad set of bispecific product candidates with antitumor potential. Through these CAB bispecific antibodies, we believe we can activate T cells directly in tumors using CAB domains targeting tumor-specific antigens. Our CAB bispecific antibodies are not expected to lead to systemic immune activation, which we believe may allow for increased efficacy through more potent T cell activation, higher doses or administration in combination with other immuno-oncology therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, including the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our patented technology platform, intellectual property, know-how and scientific expertise in the field of biologics and immuno-oncology provide us with certain competitive advantages, including the ability of our product candidates to be active under conditions representative of the tumor microenvironment and not in normal cell conditions, we face potential competition from a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions. In immuno-oncology, we face substantial competition in the form of competing approaches to targeted antibody therapy in general, as well as competing treatments for the same types of cancer that we would plan to address with our pipeline of product candidates. 
 There are numerous companies in various stages of clinical development of ADCs, a key feature of our product candidates BA3011, BA3021 and BA3071. Currently, there are 10 approved ADCs and as of February 2020, there were approximately 60 ADCs in clinical development, the vast majority of which were being developed for the treatment of cancer. Certain other companies are also pursuing antibody therapies in immuno-oncology, such as Seattle Genetics. Although we do not believe competing companies have selective CAB technology, there is a wide array of activity in multiple areas of immune-based cellular therapies for oncology. We also face competition on specific targets, including on antibody-based therapies for ROR2, the target of our second product candidate, BA3021, from NBE-Therapeutics AG.
In addition, if any of our product candidates are approved in oncology indications such as pancreatic, breast and other cancers, they may compete with existing biologics and small molecule therapies, or may be used in combination with existing therapies. There are also many other therapies under development that are intended to treat the same cancers that we are targeting or may target with our CAB technology platform, including through approaches that could prove to be more effective, have fewer side effects, be cheaper to manufacture, be more convenient to administer or have other advantages over any products resulting from our technology. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government 
 
34 


  and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. In addition, our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic or more convenient than products we may develop. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products entry. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our CAB antibodies are designed and produced using our patented Comprehensive Integrated Antibody Optimization, or CIAO!, technology. The successful evolution, design and development of a CAB antibody with specific characteristics and qualities require that the development and manufacturing processes result in the CAB antibody with the desired properties. We have developed our patented process of CIAO! that integrates into the design process the critical features for subsequent development steps and manufacturing. A key element of the CIAO! process is that all design and development of the antibody is conducted in a mammalian cell line such as Chinese hamster ovary. This host cell is essentially identical to that used for manufacturing the majority of antibodies. This integrated and efficient approach is designed to provide consistency of the folding, glycosylation and other critical features throughout the development and commercialization process for improved activity, selectivity and yields in manufacturing. 
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We also expect to rely on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates that require such tests. Furthermore, the raw materials for our product candidates may be sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier. As part of the manufacture and design process for our product candidates, we rely on internal, scientific and manufacturing know-how and trade secrets and the know-how and trade secrets of third-party manufacturers. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. 
Collaborations 
 We intend to selectively enter into collaborations to maximize the value of our platform and pipeline, including our existing collaboration involving BA3071. 
 Global Co-Development and Collaboration Agreement with BeiGene, Ltd. 
 In April 2019, we entered into a Global Co-Development and Collaboration Agreement with BeiGene, Ltd. which, as amended in December 2019 and October 2020, provides for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of BioAtlas investigational CAB CTLA-4 antibody, BA3071. Under the terms of our BeiGene collaboration, BeiGene is generally responsible for developing the CAB-CTLA-4 antibody and is 
 
35 


  responsible for global regulatory filings and commercialization. Subject to the terms of the agreement, BeiGene holds an exclusive license with BioAtla to develop and manufacture the product candidate globally. BeiGene is responsible for all costs of development, manufacturing and commercialization globally.

BeiGene may terminate the agreement at any time after the one-year anniversary of the agreement subject to 90 days written notice, or any time subject to 45 days notice if it is determined that the proof of concept milestone or technological or scientific feasibility will not be achieved. The agreement also contains customary provisions for termination by either party, including in the event of breach, subject to cure. 
 License Agreements 
 Exclusive License Agreement with Inversagen, LLC 
 In March 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Inversagen, LLC, as amended in July 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Inversagen an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, make, have made, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import CAB-antibodies for the field of diseases associated with aging, outside of cancer, and an immuno-oncology antibody. We may perform development services under the agreement and will be reimbursed by Inversagen for our costs. Commencing on the first commercial sale of the CAB-antibodies and immuno-oncology antibody subject to the agreement, Inversagen will pay us royalties in the mid-single digits, which represents a variable interest held by us. We have an option for a period of 10 years to acquire the sole and exclusive rights solely to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import the immuno-oncology antibody in the field worldwide (except for the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) in return for royalty payments in the low-single digits during the applicable royalty term. For both royalties paid to us by Inversagen and, upon exercise of our option, royalties paid to Inversagen by us, the royalty term, on a product-by-product basis, is the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of such product in a country and ending upon the later to occur of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patent rights controlled by us or by Inversagen covering the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of such product, (ii) 10 years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect so long as Inversagen or any of its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing the CAB-antibodies or immuno-oncology antibody in the field or we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing the CAB-antibodies or immuno-oncology antibody outside the field. We can also terminate the agreement with 30 days prior written notice for Inversagens failure to pay. No payments have been made to date.

 Amended and Restated Exclusive Rights Agreement with Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC 
 In January 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive Rights Agreement with Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC an exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, manufacture, conduct clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize 10 CAB-antibodies for the territory of China, Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan and a CAB-HER2-bispecific-antibody worldwide, in each case in the field of the treatment of cancer in humans. We also granted Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC an exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, manufacture, conduct clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize an IL-22 non-CAB-antibody worldwide, which rights are subject to certain co-development plans in the agreement for the joint development and commercialization of the IL-22 non-CAB-antibody by Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC and us. The term of the agreement continues unless terminated by mutual written consent of the parties and also contains customary provisions for termination by either party. Payments to us may include upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties equal to the lower of (i) the low teens of annual net sales and (ii) the mid-twenties of the royalties and other comparable payments received by Himalaya Therapeutics SEZC from third parties, which represent a variable interest held by us, but no payments have been made to date. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, is the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and expiring upon the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in a patent covering the composition of matter or method of use for such product licensed under the agreement in such country, (ii) the expiration of any other exclusivity protection of such licensed product in such country, and (iii) the 15th anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. We are eligible to receive up to $77.5 million in upfront payments and potential milestones. 
 Exclusive License Agreement with BioAtla Holdings, LLC 
 In January 2020, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with BioAtla Holdings, LLC, as amended in July 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted BioAtla Holdings an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import CAB antibodies for certain targets in the field of Adoptive Cell Therapy, or ACT (CAR-T). Commencing on the first commercial sale of the CAB antibodies subject to the agreement, BioAtla Holdings will pay us royalties in the mid-single digits, which represents a variable interest held by us. We have an option for a period of 10 years to acquire the sole and exclusive rights solely to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import the ACT preparations and ACT treatments in the ACT field worldwide (except for the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) in return for royalty payments in the low-single digits during the applicable royalty term. For both royalties paid to us by BioAtla Holdings and, upon exercise of our option, royalties paid to BioAtla Holdings by us, the royalty term, on a product-by-product basis, is the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of such product in a country and ending upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patent rights controlled by us or by BioAtla Holdings covering the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of such product. We will not owe BioAtla Holdings any milestone or royalty payments unless we exercise our option to acquire the rights to the ACT preparations and ACT treatments. During the term of the agreement, we agreed not to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale or import any CAB ACT treatment in the field of ACT. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect so long as BioAtla Holdings or any of its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing the ACT preparations and treatments in the ACT field or we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing any CAB non-ACT product for any indication outside the ACT field. The agreement may be terminated only by the mutual written agreement of the parties. No payments have been made to date. 
 In addition, effective January 2020, we entered into a Royalty Sharing Agreement whereby we agreed to share with BioAtla Holdings 50% of the royalties we receive under the license agreement with EXUMA Biotech Corp. (formerly F1 Oncology, Inc.) described below.

 Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with EXUMA Biotech Corp 
 In May 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with EXUMA Biotech Corp. (EXUMA, formerly F1 Oncology, Inc.) and its affiliates, which, as amended in July 2016 and November 2017 and as amended and restated in November 2019, granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize four CAB ACT (CAR-T) preparations and treatments for cancer. F1 Oncology granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid-up, sublicensable license under certain patents and know-how controlled by EXUMA and EXUMAs interest in technology jointly developed under the agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize non-ACT CAB products for any indication. 
 EXUMA is obligated to pay us during the royalty term, on a product-by-product basis and country-by-country basis, mid-single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of certain EXUMA ACT products, subject to certain adjustments. The term during which EXUMA is obligated to pay royalties under the agreement with respect to any particular product in any particular country, will begin on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and will end on the date of expiration of the last-to-expire of certain product-related patent rights in such country. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect so long as EXUMA or any of its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing any EXUMA products in the ACT field or we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees are developing or commercializing any CAB products for any indication outside the ACT field. The agreement may be terminated only by the mutual written agreement of the parties. 
 In connection with the agreement, we received common and preferred stock of EXUMA. These holdings of EXUMA common and preferred stock were retained by BioAtla Holdings in connection with the LLC Division. 
 In November 22, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with EXUMA, which curtailed the rights to certain CAB intellectual property previously licensed to EXUMA in exchange for a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $10,000, but does not change EXUMAs obligation to pay us royalties on licensed products. In connection with the Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement, BioAtla Holdings sold its EXUMA common and preferred holdings back to EXUMA for consideration of $25,000. 
 CHO-S Cell Line License Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation 
 On June 28, 2018, we entered into the CHO-S Cell Line License Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Life Technologies Corporation provides and grants to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable license to use certain CHO-S cells to make, or have made, recombinant proteins for clinical or commercial purposes and to seek regulatory approval for the sale of such recombinant proteins in exchange for a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $400,000. No royalties are due by us to Life Technologies Corporation under the agreement. Additional specific lots of Life Technologies Corporations recombinant proteins may be ordered by us for an additional fee of $50,000 per lot. The term of the agreement continues in perpetuity unless terminated by either party. 
 Intellectual property 
 Since inception, we have recognized the value of strong, defensible and relevant intellectual property protection. We seek to protect our technologies and products and the potential market for such technologies and products. To accomplish this goal, we apply for patents covering our processes and compositions. We also apply for patents covering developments and technologies for purpose of preventing third parties from developing competing products. Inventions related to various aspects of our core technologies have already been protected by issued and pending patent applications. As of December 31, 2020, we have 492 patents and patent applications with 257 issued, 9 allowed applications and 226 pending applications. 
 
38 


 The objectives of our IP strategy are to increase shareholder value by adequately protecting our platform technologies and compositions of matter, discerning and maximizing the value of our patent portfolio, providing a flexible portfolio that is aligned with our business model and maintaining a cost-effective strategy. We achieve these goals by creating a defensible patent shield, employing most-likely-to-succeed strategies, patenting strategically to reinforce the value of our IP and to minimize costs related to patenting while maximizing value, and by understanding the technology landscape to ensure patentability and freedom to operate. For our CAB products, we act strategically to maximize patent term by timely filing our patent applications. 
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty of the invention, the obviousness of the invention and the ability to satisfy the enablement and written description requirements of the patent laws. We file all relevant types of patent applications to protect our intellectual property, including patent applications with claims directed to our processes and products, and applications and uses thereof. 
 We file our applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to establish a priority filing date. Generally, we initially file provisional applications. Provisional applications are designed to provide a lower-cost first patent application filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the filing date of the first provisional application filed for an invention. In some cases, multiple provisional applications have been filed within a 12-month period to capture incremental developments within the 12-month priority period while obtaining an early filing date for each development. The corresponding non-provisional patent applications benefit from the provisional applications(s) since the priority date(s) of the these non-provisional patent applications is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and because the patent term of the finally issued patents are calculated from the later, non-provisional patent application filing dates. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and delay prosecution costs, which may save costs in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. 
 Subsequently, when appropriate, we pursue patent applications in foreign countries. The PCT system for filing international patent applications is used. This system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application designating all 153 PCT member states (including countries in South, Central and North America, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia) in which national/regional patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for future the national/regional patent applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing and translation costs for such applications. At the end of a period of 2 1/2 years from the first priority date of the PCT patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the 153 PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases, by filing through a regional patent organization such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial cost savings where applications are abandoned within the first 2 1/2 years of filing. 
 For all patent applications, we determine the claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to ensure that maximum patent coverage and value are obtained for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, pending patent claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 We are attentive to the need to avoid the unauthorized use of patented technology belonging to third parties. We perform non-infringement searches and analyses for our existing technologies and will continue to do so for 
 
39 


  future commercial processes and products. For our new developments, we regularly perform expert searches and reviews, and monitor patents and patent applications by third-party competitors. Our policy of avoiding patent infringement is diligently executed. To the best of our knowledge as of the date of this prospectus, we have freedom to operate on all of our technologies and product candidates. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the scope of an issued patent can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our patents, please see Risk factorsRisks related to our intellectual property. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the patent. A U.S. patent may be accorded a patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in granting the patent caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, in the United States, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive regulatory approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We further own trade secrets relating to our technology platform and product candidates, and we maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees and consultants also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment or work with us or from the employees or consultants use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our trade secrets, please see Risk factorsRisks related to our intellectual property.

41 


  treatment of cancer. EXUMAs rights under the agreement exclude the right to grant sublicenses to third parties to discover, develop or manufacture any CAB ACT or any component of our CAB ACT technology, except as used in or incorporated into EXUMAs ACTs for cancer. 
 Government regulation and product approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biological product candidates such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Licensure and regulation of biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDCA, except the section of the FDCA that governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the PHSA, via a Biologic License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 U.S. biologic products development process 
 Biological product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
 

 | Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDAs current GLP regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with the FDAs GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
42 


 
 | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file an application;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidates identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, where applicable, and post-approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or his or her legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution or excretion. If possible, a Phase 1 clinical trial may also seek to gain an early understanding of the product candidates
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
43 


 
effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. The biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
These phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the antitumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s). 
 Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (i) where the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (ii) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. Approval on the basis of a single trial may be subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
44 


 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biologic product. The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the products CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
 The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency files. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. Once the submission is filed by the FDA, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product candidates identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS involve additional risk minimization strategies to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 
45 


 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA files the BLA, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Compliance with cGMP requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. 
 Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for fast track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable 
 
46 


  user fees. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the products clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to submission of the application or approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP 
 
47 


  regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. A sponsor also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trials by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the products marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was 
 
48 


  designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsors marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. Because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitors product could be used for the orphan indication despite another products orphan exclusivity. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. 
 The FDAs determination of whether two ADCs are the same product for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity is based on a determination of sameness of the monoclonal antibody element and the functional element of the conjugated molecule. Two ADCs are deemed to be the same product if the complementarity determining region sequences of the antibody and the functional element of the conjugated molecule are the same. A difference in either of those two elements can result in a determination that the molecules are different. 
 FDA approval and regulation of companion diagnostics 
 If safe and effective use of our products depends on an
 in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves our product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a biologic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the biologic product or new biologic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. 
 Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our products will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by CDER and the FDAs Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In 
 
49 


  particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic and foreign facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA generally does not apply to any biologic product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, beginning in 2020, PREA applies to BLAs for orphan-designated biologics if the biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDAs determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has licensed numerous biosimilars under the BPCIA, and has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or studies though the FDA has broad discretion to set biosimilar licensure data requirements. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being developed by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the applicants own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created an exclusivity period for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Patent term restoration and extension 
 In the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND involving human beings and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the products approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. 
 Regulation and procedures governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy 
 
51 


  and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, post-market surveillance and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. Except in limited cases of compassionate use, it also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union. 
 Clinical trial approval 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials (excluding non-interventional trials) conducted in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, the sponsor of a clinical trial must submit a request for authorization to the competent national authority of the European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant must obtain a favorable opinion from the competent ethics committee before starting a clinical trial. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, but it has not yet become effective. Its application is subject to the full functionality of the European Union clinical trials portal and database. According to the most recent official communications, the audit aiming to confirm the full functionality of the portal and database will be conducted in December 2020. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and shorter deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The scientific assessment of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State would be carried out once for all the concerned Member States while other aspects (e.g., informed consent requirements) are assessed by each Member State for its territory. In addition, sponsors must post clinical trial information (e.g., a summary of trial results) at the EudraCT website. 
 PRIME designation in the European Union 
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Eligibility for the PRIME scheme depends on the availability of adequate preclinical and clinical data to justify a potential major public health interest prior to the initiation of confirmatory clinical trials at the proof of concept stage. Products from micro, small and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies and benefit from fee reductions with the EMA. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, scientific advice on key decision points for the preparation of the MAA and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. More specifically, a kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on 
 
52 


  the overall development and regulatory strategies. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact (rapporteur) from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies in the case of an advanced therapy, are appointed early in the PRIME scheme to provide continuous support and help to build knowledge ahead of a MAA. 
 Marketing authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. In order to support the authorization of medicinal products for children, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The requirement for a PIP also applies to applications for new indications, pharmaceutical forms or routes of administration for medicinal products that are already authorized. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union Member States. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure is optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA through the CHMP responsible for conducting an initial assessment of the product. 
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. The final decision on the MAA is issued by the European Commission, in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA, and after the Member States have had an opportunity to comment on it. 
 With respect to medicinal products for which a centralized authorization is not mandatory, the applicant may choose between: (i) the national procedure provided for by a specific Member State, for the marketing of the product in its territory, (ii) the decentralized procedure, for drug candidates that are not marketed in any of the Member States but the applicant wishes to market them on more than one EU national territories or (iii) the mutual recognition procedure, which applies to products already authorized in a Member State and whose marketing in other Member States territories is sought. 
 Regulatory data protection in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. 
 
53 


  These exclusivity periods apply only once from the first authorization granted to an applicant for a given active substance and they cannot be renewed when the same marketing authorization holder is granted new authorizations for new indications, strengths, pharmaceutical forms, administration routes or presentations of the same active substance. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess another product (either generic, hybrid or biosimilar) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic, hybrid or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but no generic, hybrid or biosimilar medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Patent term extensions in the European Union and other jurisdictions 
 The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union. 
 Periods of authorization and renewals 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state, depending on the procedure through which the marketing authorization has been granted. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization is granted ceases to be valid. 
 Regulatory requirements after marketing authorization 
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Unions stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturers license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMAs GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in the manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.

 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (ii) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug for which the orphan designation is requested will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory and scientific assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. In particular, an orphan drug designation leads to a 10-year period of market exclusivity from the granting of the concerned medicinal product marketing authorization for the particular indication. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar or identical active substance, or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable so as to not to justify market exclusivity. 
 General Data Protection Regulation 
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to 20 million or 4% of annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. 
 Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020, which is extendable up to two years. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union have so far mainly focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements but have been extremely difficult to date. To date, only an outline of a trade agreement has been reached. Much remains open but the Prime Minister has indicated that the United Kingdom will not seek to extend the transitional period beyond the end of 2020. If 
 
55 


  no trade agreement has been reached before the end of the transitional period, there may be significant market and economic disruption. The Prime Minister has also indicated that the United Kingdom will not accept high regulatory alignment with the European Union. 
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom although the United Kingdom has committed for recognition of EU laws. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for any product candidates we may develop, which could significantly and materially harm our business. 
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that implements and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. During the period of transition (i.e., until December 31, 2020), European Union law will continue to apply in the United Kingdom, including the GDPR, after which the GDPR will be converted into United Kingdom law. Beginning in 2021, the United Kingdom will be a third country under the GDPR. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable European Union Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Federal and state data privacy and security laws 
 Under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal administrative, civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and 
 
56 


  damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAAs privacy and security rules. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well. 
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first GDPR-like law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the TCJA, 
 
57 


  which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the case, and oral arguments were held on November 10, 2020, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the ACA that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030 absent additional congressional action. In addition, the CARES Act suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a Blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the other out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent principles for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump administrations budget proposal for the fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 36 employees. We also engaged 18 independent contractors located in China as of December 31, 2020 pursuant to our relationship with BioDuro, a U.S.-based provider of preclinical development services. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

 Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, participation in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a 401(k) plan. 
 Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. Our current efforts are focused on three primary areas: 

 | Safe work environment. We provide training to all employees to improve their understanding of behaviors that can be perceived as discriminatory, exclusionary, and/or harassing, and provide safe avenues for employees to report such behaviors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal employment opportunity. We ensure that our practices and processes attract a diverse range of candidate, and that candidates are recruited, hired, assigned, developed, and promoted based on merit and their alignment to our values.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Learning and development opportunities. To support our employees in reaching their full potential, we offer a wide range of internal and external learning and development opportunities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Community Involvement. We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We work with local universities to introduce and promote careers in science and biotechnology through internship opportunities.
