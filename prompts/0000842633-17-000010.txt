Prompt: Summarize the business model from the following text. Answer with a continuous text and with fivehundredtwelve tokens at max. Set your focus on sources of revenue , the intended customer base , products , distribution channels  and details of financing. Use only information from the following the text:

Item 1.    Business
We are a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of engineered products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Most of our businesses share important characteristics, including leading market positions, strong brand names, broad product offerings in focused markets, established distribution networks, relatively high operating margins, relatively low capital investment requirements and growth opportunities. We use a common operating model across our businesses. The TriMas Business Model is the framework that provides, wherever possible given the diverse nature of our businesses, commonality and consistency across TriMas, and drives how we plan, budget, measure, review, incent and reward our people. It provides the foundation for determining our priorities, executing our growth and productivity initiatives, and allocating capital and resources. We believe that a majority of our 2016 net sales were in markets in which our products enjoy the number one or number two market position within their respective product categories. 
Our Reportable Segments
Our operations are in four reportable segments which had net sales and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 as follows: Packaging (net sales: $341.3 million; operating profit: $77.8 million), Aerospace (net sales: $174.9 million; operating loss: $90.8 million), Energy (net sales: $159.0 million; operating loss: $13.8 million) and Engineered Components (net sales: $118.8 million; operating profit: $15.3 million). For information pertaining to the net sales and operating profit attributed to our reportable segments, refer to Note 19, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Form 10-K.
During the second half of 2015 and throughout 2016, organic sales and profit levels within our Aerospace business significantly declined, primarily as a result of: 1) lower demand from distribution customers, as a result of reduced investment in inventory levels; 2) manufacturing inefficiencies and lower fixed cost absorption associated with lower distributor sales, plus scheduling and production challenges in the Monogram Aerospace Fasteners facility, which resulted in higher costs to generate the sales; and 3) a less favorable product sales mix, as a result of a higher percentage of sales generated by lower margin product lines. We implemented recovery plan actions to address production inefficiencies and to align operating costs consistent with production requirements to meet current demand levels. However, given the currently lower than expected Aerospace growth and profitability, and lowered near-term future sales and profit expectations, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges totaling $98.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, due to a significant decline in current and expected profitability levels in our Energy reportable segment and our Arrow Engine business within our Engineered Components reportable segment, and a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $70.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively. For information pertaining to these impairment charges, refer to Note 7, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Form 10-K.
In addition to our reportable segments as presented, we have discontinued certain lines of businesses over the past three years as follows, the results of which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the financial statements attached hereto:

• | On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our Cequent businesses, comprised of the former Cequent Americas and Cequent Asia Pacific Europe Africa ("Cequent APEA") reportable segments, creating a new independent publicly traded company, Horizon Global Corporation ("Horizon"), through the distribution of 100% of the Company's interest in Horizon to holders of the Company's common stock.


• | During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased operations of our NI Industries business. NI Industries manufactured cartridge cases for the defense industry and was party to a U.S. Government facility maintenance contract. We received approximately $6.7 million for the sale of certain intellectual property and related inventory and tooling.

Each of our reportable segment has distinct products, distribution channels, strengths and strategies, which are described on the following pages.

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Packaging employs an internal sales force in North America, Europe and Asia. Packaging focuses its business and sales organization into the industrial, food and beverage, and health, beauty and home care end markets to better provide the breadth of its product portfolio and solutions to its customers. Packaging also uses third-party agents and distributors in key geographic markets, including Europe, South America and Asia. Packaging's agents and distributors primarily sell directly to container manufacturers and to users or fillers of containers. While the point of sale may be to a container manufacturer or bottle filling business, Packaging, via a "pull through" strategy, calls on the container user or filler and suggests that it specify that our product be used on its container.
 6

To support its "pull-through" strategy, Packaging offers more attractive pricing on products purchased directly from us and on products in which the container users or fillers specify Packaging's products. Users or fillers that utilize or specify our products include agricultural chemical, food, industrial chemical, paint, personal care, petroleum, pharmaceutical and sanitary supply chemical companies such as BASF, BMW/Mini, Gechem Gmbh, McDonald's, Mercedes, Pennzoil Quaker State, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Healthcare and Sherwin-Williams, among others.
Packaging's primary end customers include Colgate, Conagra Brands, Dial Corporation, Ecolab, L’Oreal, Mast Global (Bath & Body Works and Victoria Secret), Method, Nestle, Purna Pharmaceuticals, PZ Cussons, RB (formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser), Starbucks, Thornton & Ross and Unilever. We also supply major container manufacturers around the world such as Berenfield, Berlin Packaging, BWAY, Cleveland Steel Container, Greif, North Coast Container and Tricorbraun. Packaging maintains a customer service center that provides technical support as well as other technical assistance to customers to reduce overall production costs.
Competition
Since Packaging has a broad range of products in both closures and dispensing systems, there are competitors in each of our product offerings. We do not believe that there is a single competitor that matches our entire product offering.
Depending on the product and customers served, Packaging's competitors include Aptar, Albea, Bericap, West Rock, Berry Plastics, Greif, Phoenix Closures, Technocraft and TKPC.

Strategies
The Energy segment has been faced with several market challenges including a reduction of its upstream business as a result of the decline in oil prices, as well as downstream business postponement of refinery shutdowns and customer capital expenditures. We believe Energy has opportunities to improve its margins, while maintaining its market leadership, including:

• | Optimizing its Footprint to Drive Lower-Costs. Over the past 18 months, we have continued to work through reducing our cost structure through ongoing manufacturing, overhead and administrative productivity initiatives, global sourcing and selectively shifting manufacturing capabilities to our lower cost locations. We have performed a comprehensive review of our physical footprint and have closed or consolidated locations to reduce our and realign fixed cost structure with recent demand levels. We have also moved a portion of our gasket and fastener operations from our Houston facility to a facility in Reynosa, Mexico, and we will continue to evaluate costs, lead-times and service levels to customers to determine where certain products should be manufactured. We have also reconfigured our Houston facility to increase efficiency and lower costs, allowing for incremental capacity. In addition to our core domestic manufacturing facility in Houston, we have sourcing capabilities in China. We believe expanding our new Matrix® product will further increase profitability, as we manufacture our own sheet product compared to reliance on comparable products from our competitors.


• | Improve Operational Efficiency at all Locations. We believe that there are additional opportunities to improve our operational efficiency through continued implementation of lean-based manufacturing initiatives. Through improved planning, inventory management, pricing and processes, Energy expects to improve its margins, while reducing product lead-times and increasing customer fill-rates. 


• | Expand Engineered and Specialty Products Offering. Over the past few years, we have launched several new highly-engineered and specialty products and have broadened our specialty bolt offering. Examples of new products include: WRI-LP gaskets, a hydrofluoric acid gasket solution; inhibitor gaskets designed to prevent corrosion in offshore platform flanges; IsoTekTM Gaskets, an engineered sealing solution for flanged pipe connections; hose products; and intelligent bolts which provide more reliable load indication. In addition to providing revenue growth opportunities, specialty products tend to have higher margins than their standard counterparts.

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Energy relies upon a combination of direct sales forces and established networks of independent distributors and licensees with familiarity of our end user customers. Gaskets and bolts are supplied directly to major customers through our sales and service facilities in major regional markets, or through a large network of independent distributors/licensees. The sales and distribution network's close proximity to the customer makes it possible for Energy to respond to customer-specific engineered applications and provide a high degree of customer service. Our overseas sales are made either through our newer sales and service facilities, licensees or through our many distributors. Significant Energy customers include BP, Corpus Christi Gasket, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, DNOW, MRC and Valero.
Competition
Energy's primary competitors include ERIKS, Flexitallic Group, Garlock (EnPro), GHX, Klinger and Lone Star. Most of Energy's competitors supply either gaskets or bolts.

Strategies
We believe the businesses within the Engineered Components segment have opportunities to grow, based on the following:

• | Strong Product Innovation. The Engineered Components segment has a history of successfully creating and introducing new products and there are currently several significant product initiatives underway. Arrow Engine continues to introduce new products in the area of industrial engine spare parts for various industrial engines not manufactured by Arrow Engine, including selected engines manufactured and sold under the Caterpillar®, Waukesha® and Ajax® brands. Arrow Engine has also launched an offering of customizable compressors and gas production and meter run equipment, which are used by existing end customers in the oil and natural gas extraction markets, as well as development of a natural gas compressor used for compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations. Norris Cylinder developed a process for manufacturing ISO cylinders from higher tensile strength steel which allows for a lighter weight cylinder at the same gas service pressure. Norris Cylinder was the first to gain United Nations certification by the US Department of Transportation for its ISO cylinders, and as such remains the first manufacturer approved to distribute ISO cylinders domestically. Norris Cylinder has also created new designs for seamless acetylene applications in marine and international markets 


• | Entry into New Markets and Development of New Customers. Engineered Components has opportunities to grow its businesses by offering its products to new customers, markets and geographies. Norris Cylinder is the only manufacturer of steel high-pressure and acetylene cylinders in North America. Norris Cylinder is selling its cylinders internationally into Europe, South Africa, and South and Central America, as well as pursuing new end markets such as cylinders for use as hydrogen fuel cells in storage (cell towers) and transport (fork trucks), in breathing air applications and in fire suppression. Arrow Engine continues to expand its product portfolio to serve new customers and new applications for oil and natural gas production in all areas of the industry, including shale drilling. Arrow Engine is also expanding international sales, particularly in Mexico, Indonesia and Venezuela. 


• | Manage Capacity to Reflect Expected Demand Levels. Norris Cylinder has deployed previously acquired assets in both its Huntsville, Alabama and Longview, Texas facilities to improve efficiency, mitigate risk and support its future expected growth, increasing its capacity for both large and small high pressure cylinders. Norris Cylinder is in process of installing equipment in an effort to produce higher volume cylinders more efficiently, while allowing higher technology products to be produced on the current forge asset. Norris Cylinder also flexes its costs in coordination with movements in demand. Arrow Engine has been unfavorably impacted by reductions in drilling activity driven by the decline in oil prices. In response, Arrow Engine has been focused on right-sizing its business to reflect the current demand levels by lowering costs and maximizing resources until the end market recovers. Where possible, Arrow Engine is variablizing the cost structure to respond quickly to end market changes and enhance flexibility, driving low cost sourcing efforts, and focusing on additional productivity and Lean initiatives.

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Engineered Components' customers operate in the oil, gas, industrial and commercial industries. Given the focused nature of many of our products, the Engineered Components segment relies upon a combination of direct sales forces and established networks of independent distributors with familiarity of the end-users. In many of the markets this segment serves, its companies' brand names are virtually synonymous with product applications. The narrow end-user base of many of these products makes it possible for this segment to respond to customer-specific engineered applications and provide a high degree of customer service. Engineered Components' OEM and aftermarket customers include Airgas, Air Liquide, Chesapeake, Kidde-Fenwal, Natural Gas Compression Systems, Praxair and Total Operations and Production Services (TOPS). In years with higher levels of drilling activity, DNOW and Weatherford were larger customers of engines, parts and compressor products. 
Competition
Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors. Norris Cylinder competes against Worthington, Beijing Tianhai Industry Co., Faber and Vitkovice Cylinders. In May 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous final determination that Norris Cylinder had been materially injured by imports of DOT high pressure steel cylinders that were being subsidized by the Government of China, as well as being dumped in the U.S. market by producers in China. As a result, antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on the subject imports to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States, which expire in 2017, but are subject to renewal. Engineered Components' companies supply highly engineered, non-commodity, customer-specific products with large shares of small markets supplied by a limited number of competitors.
Acquisition Strategy
We believe that our businesses have significant opportunities to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. We typically seek "bolt-on" acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers, end markets and distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. Strategically, our primary focus is currently on acquisition targets in the Packaging segment, as this segment has a higher growth and margin profile. We will also consider opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in our other segments, although such transactions are likely to be more modest in terms of target size and transaction value.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
Our largest raw material purchases are for steel, aluminum, titanium, cast iron, polyethylene and other resins. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from low-cost sources in China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers with pricing contracts principally in the three-to-six month time frame. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. Polyethylene is generally a commodity resin with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. While both steel and polyethylene are readily available from a variety of competing suppliers, our business has experienced, and we believe will continue to experience, volatility in the costs of these raw materials.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,000 people, of which approximately 47% were located outside the United States and 21% were unionized. We currently have collective bargaining agreements covering six facilities worldwide, two of which are in the United States. Employee relations have generally been satisfactory. 
In December 2016, we concluded, without a work stoppage or strike, a three-year extension of our labor agreement with the Basrur Uniseal Company Karmikara Sangha (a unit of BNIWU - CITU) at our Energy facility in Bangalore, India.
In January 2015, we finalized the decision to move a portion of the gasket and fastener operations from our Energy facility in Houston, Texas to a new facility in Reynosa, Mexico. This decision impacted less than 10% of the Houston facility's unionized work force. 
Seasonality and Backlog
None of our reportable segments experience significant seasonal fluctuations. However, our fourth quarter tends to be our lowest revenue quarter as a result of holiday slowdowns at certain of our significant customers.

We do not consider sales order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses. Our Aerospace customers often provide a forward view of build rates and need for products, but firm orders do not extend for more than a few months, and are not guaranteed and subject to change.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
Current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. However, we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.
Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names and technology, are recorded at approximately $213.9 million at December 31, 2016, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our operating groups designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see discussion above by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law.
Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all four of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 14.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States, and we may expand our international operations through organic growth actions and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 14.7% of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2016 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $76.2 million of export sales from the United States. For information pertaining to the net sales and operating net assets attributed to our international operations, refer to Note 19, "Segment Information," included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," within this Form 10-K.
