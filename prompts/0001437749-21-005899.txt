Item 1.  Business
 
Bel Fuse Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.  These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries.  Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.
 
With more than 70 years in operation, Bel has reliably demonstrated the ability to succeed in a variety of product areas across a global platform.  The Company has a strong track record of technical innovation working with the engineering teams of market leaders.  Bel has consistently proven itself a valuable supplier to world-class companies by developing new products with cost effective solutions.
 
The Company is organized under New Jersey law.  Bel's principal executive offices are located at 206 Van Vorst Street, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302, and Bel's telephone number is (201) 432-0463. The Company operates facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (ticker symbols BELFA and BELFB).  For information regarding Bel's operating segments, see Note 12, "Segments", of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  Hereinafter, all references to "Note" will refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Acquisitions have played a critical role in the growth of Bel and the expansion of both our product portfolio and our customer base and continue to be a key element in our growth strategy. The Company may, from time to time, purchase equity positions in companies that are potential merger candidates.  We frequently evaluate possible merger candidates that would provide such potential benefits as an expanded product and technology base that would allow us to expand the breadth of our product offerings to our strategic customers and/or provide an opportunity to reduce overall operating expense as a percentage of revenue.  Other factors such as whether such possible merger candidates are positioned to take advantage of our lower cost offshore manufacturing facilities, and whether a cultural fit would allow the acquired company to be integrated smoothly and efficiently are also considered.
 
On December 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the power supply products business of CUI Inc. (the "CUI power business") through an asset purchase agreement with CUI Global Inc. for $29.2 million (after a working capital adjustment), plus the assumption of certain liabilities.  The CUI power business designs and markets a broad portfolio of AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies and board level components.  The CUI power business is headquartered in Tualatin, Oregon and contributed sales of $43.1 million for 2020 and $2.2 million for 2019.  The acquisition of the CUI power business enhanced Bel's existing offering of power products, allowing us to better address more of our customers' power needs.  It also introduced an alternative business model to Bel's, one which carries a higher gross margin profile and lower manufacturing risk.
 
Products
 
The Company primarily generates revenue through the sale of its products.  Bel offers a broad array of product offerings, which are grouped as follows: Power Solutions & Protection (39% of net sales in 2020), Cinch Connectivity Solutions (32% of net sales in 2020) and Magnetic Solutions (29% of net sales in 2020).  While there are key customers and end markets within each of the three product groups, only one direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 (this customer represented 11.9% of our consolidated net sales in 2020).  Our diverse product mix and customer base minimizes our dependence on any one customer or end market. 
Power Solutions and Protection
 
Bel's power conversion products include internal and external AC/DC power supplies, DC/DC converters and DC/AC inverters. These products provide power conversion solutions for a number of Industrial, Networking and Consumer applications.

Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products to customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Sales are made through one of three channels: direct strategic account managers, regional sales managers working with independent sales representative organizations or authorized distributors. Bel's strategic account managers are assigned to handle major accounts requiring global coordination.
 
Independent sales representatives and authorized distributors are overseen by the Company's sales management personnel located throughout the world. As of December 31, 2020, we had a sales and support staff of 196 persons that supported a network of sales representative organizations and non-exclusive distributors. We have written agreements with all of our sales representative organizations and most of our major distributors. These written agreements, terminable on short notice by either party, are standard in the industry.
 
Sales support functions have also been established and located in our international facilities to provide timely, efficient support for customers. This supplemental level of service, in addition to first-line sales support, enables us to be more responsive to customers' needs on a global level. Our marketing capabilities include product management which drives new product development, application engineering for technical support and marketing communications.
 
Market Factors
 
Competition
 
We operate in a variety of markets, all of which are highly competitive. There are numerous independent companies and divisions of major companies that manufacture products that are competitive with one or more of our products.
 
Our ability to compete is dependent upon several factors including product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. Overall financial stability and global presence also give us a favorable position in relation to many of our competitors.  Management intends to maintain a strong competitive posture in the markets we serve by continued expansion of our product lines and ongoing investment in research, development and manufacturing resources.  The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement.  See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information."
 
Trends in Market Demand
 
Product orders, or bookings, received during 2020 amounted to $448.8 million, a 3% reduction from 2019.  By product group, orders received for our Power Solutions and Protection products amounted to $183.0 million in 2020, a 30% increase from 2019.  A large portion of this increase was due to incremental bookings from the recently-acquired CUI business of $43.4 million.  The CUI business had historically strong sales in 2020 as demand for adaptors for use in home offices increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have also seen an increase in demand for our circuit protection products in 2020, and within the e-mobility and industrial markets for our power products.  Bookings for our Connectivity Solutions products declined by 29% from 2019 to $126.9 million in 2020, largely due to a reduction in demand from our direct and aftermarket commercial aerospace customers due to low levels of new aircraft production rates and the continued pause in global travel during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Orders received for our Magnetic Solutions products were $138.9 million in 2020, 3% lower than in 2019.  
Backlog of Orders
 
We typically manufacture products against firm orders and projected usage by customers. Cancellation and return arrangements are either negotiated by us on a transactional basis or contractually determined.  We estimate the value of the backlog of orders as of February 28, 2021 to be approximately $179.6 million as compared with a backlog of $186.3 million as of February 29, 2020.  Management estimates that approximately 85%-90% of the Company's backlog as of February 28, 2021 will be shipped by December 31, 2021. Factors that could cause the Company to fail to ship all such orders by year-end include unanticipated supply difficulties, changes in customer demand and new customer designs.  Due to these factors, backlog may not be a reliable indicator of the timing of future sales.

Research and Development ("R&D")
 
Our engineering groups are strategically located around the world to facilitate communication with and access to customers' engineering personnel. This collaborative approach enables partnerships with customers for technical development efforts. The global capabilities and collaborative approach allows Bel to develop leading edge technological products that support highly complex and evolving markets such as e-mobility, cloud computing, military, aerospace, and others. On occasion, we execute non-disclosure agreements with customers to help develop proprietary, next generation products destined for rapid deployment.  We also sponsor membership in technical organizations that allow our engineers to participate in developing standards for emerging technologies. It is management's opinion that this participation is critical in establishing credibility and a reputable level of expertise in the marketplace, as well as positioning the Company as an industry leader in new product development.
 
R&D costs are expensed as incurred.  Generally, R&D is performed internally for the benefit of the Company.  R&D costs include salaries, building maintenance and utilities, rents, materials, administrative costs and miscellaneous other items.  
 
Resources
 
Raw Materials and Sourcing
 
We have multiple suppliers for most of the raw materials that we purchase.  Where possible, we have contractual agreements with suppliers to assure a continuing supply of critical components.
 
With respect to those items which are purchased from single sources, we believe that comparable items would be available in the event that there were a termination of our existing business relationships with any such supplier.  While such a termination could produce a disruption in production, we believe that the termination of business with any one of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our long-term operations. Actual experience could differ materially from this belief as a result of a number of factors, including the time required to locate an alternative supplier, and the nature of the demand for our products.  In the past, we have experienced shortages in certain raw materials, such as capacitors, ferrites and integrated circuits ("IC's"), when these materials were in great demand.  Even though we may have more than one supplier for certain materials, it is possible that these materials may not be available to us in sufficient quantities or at the times desired by us.  In the event that the current economic conditions have a negative impact on the financial condition of our suppliers, this may impact the availability and cost of our raw materials.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have acquired or been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and have additional patent applications pending relating to our products. While we believe that the issued patents are defendable and that the pending patent applications relate to patentable inventions, there can be no assurance that a patent will be obtained from the applications or that our existing patents can be successfully defended.  It is management's opinion that the successful continuation and operation of our business does not depend upon the ownership of patents or the granting of pending patent applications, but upon the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing and managerial abilities of our personnel.  Our U.S. design patents have a life of 14 years and our U.S. utility patents have a life of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from filing of patent applications.  Our existing patents expire on various dates from March 2021 to January 2039.
 
We utilize registered trademarks in the U.S., Europe and Asia to identify various products that we manufacture.  The trademarks survive as long as they are in use and the registrations of these trademarks are renewed.
 
Government Contracts
 
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.
 



    5 

  

In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.
 
Seasonality
 
In the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.  Each year following the Lunar New Year holiday, we must assess the worker return rate and whether it is adequate to meet the needs of current demand from our customers.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  This temporary setback in production has historically resulted in our first quarter sales being the lowest sales quarter of the year.  Further, recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC, primarily during the first quarter of the year.
Government Regulations
 
The Company is subject to various government regulations in the United States as well as various jurisdictions where it operates. These regulations cover several diverse areas including trade compliance, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, money laundering, and data and privacy protection. Regulatory or government authorities where the Company operates may have enforcement powers that can subject the company to legal penalties or other measures and can impose changes or conditions in the way it conducts business.
Human Capital Resources, Strategy and Management
 
At Bel, our values guide everything we do. We are committed to the highest standards of ethical and legal conduct and have created an environment where open and honest communication is the expectation, not the exception. Failing to do so puts Bel’s name, reputation for integrity and business at risk.  We hold our associates to this standard and offer the same in return. Our Code of Ethics was created to ensure that our associates, officers, directors, partners, contractors, and suppliers follow our commitment to customer satisfaction in accordance with ethical and legal standards, guided by the basic, unchanging principle of integrity.
 
Our Human Capital Strategy is built around four areas:
 
Extraordinary Performance
 
Our associates are a critical driver of Bel’s global business results. On December 31, 2020, Bel employed approximately 6,400 associates across 14 countries, with 23 percent located within North America. Outside of the United States, our largest employee populations were located within Mexico, Slovakia and the PRC. We regularly monitor various key performance indicators around the key human capital priorities of attracting, retaining, and engaging our global talent. In addition, we enable the execution of our strategic priorities by providing all associates with access to training and development opportunities to improve critical skill sets.

Great Associates
 
Bel is committed to fostering an environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where associates feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully engage their talents and training in their work, while generating personal satisfaction in their role within Bel. Bel has been engaged in a strategy dedicated to evolving our inclusive culture while addressing underrepresentation across our Company.
 
Across the organization, there are a variety of ways we invest in our people to learn - on the job, in the classroom, through self-directed learning, or through leadership programs. We have expanded our learning management system to make new content and training available to our associates. The Company has also expanded leadership development programs and continues to expand internship programs to continue to develop new talent. 
 
Health and Safety
 
Bel offers a variety of programs globally to protect the health and safety of our associates. While we maintain targets for year-over-year reduction of the total recordable incident rate and serious injuries, our goal is always zero.
 
In 2020, we focused on the immediate demands within the context of COVID-19 challenges. Where possible, associates were moved to a remote work environment. In addition, we implemented additional safeguards in our plants consistent with the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations around the world.  In addition, the Company also invested in various programs globally to support associates' mental and physical health during the pandemic. We will continue to evolve these programs to protect the health and safety of our associates through awareness training and wellness programs.
 
Culture
 
In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, Bel succeeds when we attract and retain the best talent and when our associates reflect the diversity of our consumers.
 
We are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce by participating in networking and community events and to actively recruit and hire veterans, women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities.
 
As a global leader in delivering reliable solutions, Bel has signed a Statement of Support Program declaration to show support for National Guard and Reserve member associates coordinated by the Department of Defense's Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) program. The intent of the program is to increase employer support by encouraging employers to act as advocates for associate participation in the military.
 
The employee lifecycle is the foundation for the mission of the Human Resources function within the Company.  The Mission of Human Resources is to “Recruit, Train and Retain the best people.  Create an environment where associates make a difference.  Provide challenging work, a positive work environment and career opportunities.”   
 
We take pride in recognizing our associates around the world and the job well done over the last year.
