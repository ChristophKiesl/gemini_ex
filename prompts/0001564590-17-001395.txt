 MicroStrategy 10
 MicroStrategy 10 enables users to query and analyze detailed, transaction-level databases, large Hadoop® distributions, data warehouse appliances, departmental databases, cloud data sources, and user-owned data in spreadsheets. It transforms data into business insights through highly visual, interactive reports and dashboards that can be securely distributed to hundreds of thousands of users throughout an enterprise. 
 Five key business needs have driven demand for powerful analytics solutions:
  
• | Increased consumption of analytics. In the past, dissemination of information was limited to a few power-users or analysts. Now, a wide range of information users – from customer service representatives to the CEO within a company, and from customers to suppliers outside the organization – can benefit from the insight that analytics provides. The wide acceptance of the Internet as an information source also has fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the Web to tens of thousands of users across an enterprise. In addition, demand for analytics on mobile devices is being driven by the growth of the mobile Internet and by the accelerating proliferation of mobile devices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased data scalability. Increasing information generation, and in particular, the ability to capture and store electronically every business transaction and interaction, have made terabyte-size data warehouses commonplace. Due to very large data volumes at some organizations, such as data volumes
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5


 
generated by social media, data warehouses can now reach sizes in excess of tens of petabytes (1,000 terabytes). While transaction- and interaction-level information is now routinely captured, organizations often struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores. Organizations need to view data within its operational context – making even the most detailed information meaningful to business users. As a result, users want the ability to easily discover trends hidden in these very large databases and to verify these trends by reviewing the underlying detail. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved analytics system performance. The increase in user population sizes and data volumes puts a strain on analytics infrastructures. Business users expect to retrieve the information they are requesting within seconds of making the request. Mobile devices have set this expectation even higher by increasing demand for near instantaneous responses to requests. Analytics administrators need to systematically monitor and tune the analytics environment to provide the expected service levels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved data comprehension and visualization. As data volumes have increased, the growing work demands placed on business users have meant progressively less time available to users to monitor and improve their businesses and make informed decisions. As a result, business users need to view the data in a summarized, easy-to-grasp format and navigate to areas of concern for additional insight. Presenting the data in a highly visual, accessible, and interactive format to collate, view, and explore information with agility and ease of use improves the overall comprehension of the business and speeds up the decision-making process. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased demand for personalized, one-to-one customer and/or supplier experience. Many companies have implemented strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and/or supplier based on individual needs and preferences. They earn loyalty by providing superior service, security, and convenience. In order to successfully acquire, retain, and upgrade customers, these organizations need to understand their customers’ profiles, transaction histories, past responses to marketing campaigns, and interactions with customer service. This information is often stored in widely dispersed and complex data sources, and obtaining a holistic view of the customer can be challenging.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The volume of data available to enterprises is growing at a very high rate, being driven by greater transaction detail, more sensors, more external data, and more data from mobile and social media platforms. MicroStrategy 10 helps organizations worldwide take advantage of this explosive growth in enterprise data by equipping managers and employees with timely, actionable information to make data-driven business decisions.
 Solutions built on MicroStrategy 10 can give analysts, managers, and executives the critical insight they need to reduce costs, better allocate resources, improve efficiencies, and optimize operations. MicroStrategy 10 can also be used to build stronger relationships with business partners and suppliers by providing insights for managing inventory levels, analyzing supply chains, and tracking vendor performance. MicroStrategy 10 also includes predictive capabilities that enable organizations to leverage their historical data to project future business outcomes.
 MicroStrategy 10 provides IT professionals with a powerful, highly automated mechanism for delivering insightful reports, visualizations, and dashboards to employees throughout an organization.  In addition, MicroStrategy 10 includes a self-service feature, MicroStrategy Visual Insight™, which enables business users to upload, prepare, and explore enterprise data on their own, without any coding or IT expertise.  With this feature, business users can spot trends and outliers in a completely visual and interactive way, thereby eliminating much of the need for IT to create reports and dashboards for them.
 MicroStrategy 10 is available in two distinct end-user platforms: MicroStrategy Analytics and MicroStrategy Desktop.  MicroStrategy Analytics is designed for enterprise-scale business intelligence, supporting high performance analytics on gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes of data.  Organizations can deploy MicroStrategy Analytics on-premise or access the same functionality within the MicroStrategy Cloud offering. MicroStrategy Desktop puts the power of MicroStrategy 10 into the hands of individual users for self-service visual analytics and data discovery.  The two products share a common user experience — making it easy to start small with self-service analytics and grow into the production-grade features of MicroStrategy Analytics.

MicroStrategy’s Metadata Architecture 
 The core differentiator of our products stems from their metadata-based centralized architecture, which has been built and refined over many years and provides access to enterprise data using familiar business terms, rules, and logic. The portable, flexible, reusable, object-oriented and dynamic nature of the metadata provides an efficient BI application and mobile app development platform while maximizing maintainability and enforcing enterprise-wide consistency. The dynamic behavior of metadata in our products helps ensure consistency across business definitions, and minimizes the number of objects created, stored, and managed.  Other BI technologies are limited in their reuse capabilities, forcing developers to create the same components over and over again for use in each individual report.
 MicroStrategy Server 
 MicroStrategy Server is the architectural foundation of MicroStrategy 10. It provides the core analytical processing and job management for all reporting, analysis, and monitoring applications. It provides a powerful, comprehensive set of features necessary for a scalable, fault-tolerant, enterprise-wide business intelligence system.
 As the central contact point to metadata, MicroStrategy Server dynamically assembles the metadata objects to create optimized, multi-pass SQL queries for every major relational database, HiveQL queries for Hadoop distributions like Cloudera, MapR, Hortonworks, and Amazon EMR, interactive queries for real-time distributed SQL processing, optimized connectivity for NoSQL sources like Apache Cassandra™, HBase™, and MongoDB®, native connectivity to HDFS via MicroStrategy Hadoop Gateway, and MDX queries for multidimensional data sources. MicroStrategy Server retrieves the data, performs any additional analytical calculations not available in the databases, formats the report, and delivers the reports to business users via the MicroStrategy Web, Mobile, Office, or Desktop interfaces.
 MicroStrategy Server is a highly scalable, parallel-processing, self-tuning analytic server. It manages high performance interactions involving terabytes of data accessed by tens of thousands of users using in-memory intelligent cubes, caching, load balancing, resource prioritization, and connection pooling.

 Usher
 Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence offering that provides a highly secure, convenient way for organizations to dematerialize traditional forms of identity verification (such as passwords, tokens, and physical badges) and replace them with a single mobile identity badge that is cryptographically linked to its owner’s smartphone and dynamically linked to an enterprise’s existing identity repositories. Usher can be used as a powerful enterprise productivity and workforce management resource because it is designed to enable managers to gain an almost real-time window into the location and activity of their distributed workforces, while providing powerful interactive features to manage or direct them. With the addition of Usher Professional, administrators can track user activity on a nearly real-time map using access telemetry.  They can also engage in two-way communications with users from the Usher application.  Usher works on standard smartphones running on iOS or the Android platform, and boasts an Apple Watch integration.  Through the use of Bluetooth, QR codes, biometrics, push notifications, time-limited PIN codes, and other authentication methods, Usher users can log into applications, VPNs, and workstations, unlock doors and other physical gateways, and validate each other’s identities.  By delivering strong, multi-factor authentication that can be extended to nearly every corporate system, Usher’s digital credential solution addresses some of the biggest challenges facing corporations today, including authentication, identity and access management, and resource authorization, while applying industry leading business intelligence and analytics to an enterprise’s infrastructure. Usher is available both as on-premise software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.
 Usher can appeal to businesses, universities, associations, governments, and other organizations because it adds a layer of security to their systems, physical spaces, and transactions that would otherwise be technically difficult or cost-prohibitive. Usher is designed to secure an enterprise by offering an alternative to existing forms of identification and authentication.  Usher is designed to provide a more secure alternative to passwords, which can be stolen or cracked.  Usher is also designed to help reduce identity-related fraud by replacing physical ID cards that can be counterfeited and stolen.
 Key benefits of Usher include:
  
• | Identity protection. Usher mobile identities are designed to be more secure than traditional physical forms of identity, which can be stolen and counterfeited.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Authentication. Usher is designed to provide a more secure alternative to passwords — which can be the weak link exploited by cybercrime attacks — with secure mobile identities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physical access control. Usher users can unlock doors by tapping on a “digital key” or by scanning a QR code. If a device is Bluetooth-enabled, a user can unlock a door simply by approaching it.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Workforce management. Usher can collect data about the locations of users’ Usher activity, enabling managers to remotely monitor and direct distributed workforces.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Activity analysis. Usher uses MicroStrategy 10 to monitor and analyze Usher user activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenience and cost-effectiveness. Usher allows users to carry their business credentials in digital form on their smartphones. Enterprises can reduce costs associated with the distribution and

 Competition
 MicroStrategy 10 and MicroStrategy Cloud Competitors
 The analytics market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology paradigms.  Within the analytics space, we compete with many different vendors, including (i) large software vendors, such as IBM (Cognos), SAP (BO), Microsoft (Power BI), and Oracle (OBIEE), that provide one or more products that directly compete with our products, (ii) open source analytics vendors such as OpenText Analytics and Hitachi (Pentaho®), (iii) various other analytics software providers, such as Qlik, Tableau Software, TIBCO, Information Builders, and the SAS Institute, and (iv) other vendors offering cloud-based offerings, such as GoodData and Birst. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate and compete with these vendors and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes.  Failure to maintain adequate technology differentiation from these competitors could materially adversely affect our revenue from both existing and prospective customers. 
 19


MicroStrategy Mobile Competitors
 The market for mobile analytics is rapidly evolving. New mobile devices are being introduced in the market at a rapid pace, and enhancements to mobile operating systems are being made at an even faster rate. The rapidly changing technology landscape creates opportunities for both existing competitors and new vendors to introduce innovative new products. Within the mobile analytics space, we predominantly compete with the same set of analytics vendors that we compete with in the analytics market. Our competitiveness in this market will depend on how quickly we can adapt to the changing technology landscape and how effectively we sell, market, and differentiate our offering.
Usher Competitors
 Usher competes with companies with technologies categorized as user authentication products. These competitors focus primarily on traditional forms of identity verification such as smart cards, tokens, and password managers.  These companies have significant name recognition and offer solutions with security architectures that are familiar to IT buyers.  Usher also competes with companies with newer solutions, often involving mobile technology.
2014 Restructuring Plan
 In the third quarter of 2014, we committed to a restructuring plan (the “2014 Restructuring Plan”) to streamline our workforce and spending to better align our cost structure with our business strategy, including reducing our workforce by 777 employees.  We implemented substantially all of the 2014 Restructuring Plan by the end of 2014.  The 2014 Restructuring Plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.3 million and $14.7 million for the years ended 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Pre-tax restructuring charges were not material for the year ended 2016.  We do not expect any future costs associated with the 2014 Restructuring Plan.  See Note 8, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the 2014 Restructuring Plan.  In addition to the 2014 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented other internal cost-savings initiatives.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 2,133 employees, of whom 1,048 were based in the United States and 1,085 were based internationally. Of our 2,133 employees, 587 were engaged in sales and marketing, 512 in research and development, 711 in subscription, product support, consulting, and education services, and 323 in finance, administration, and corporate operations. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries some employees are members of trade or local unions.  In France, our employees are represented by a works council as required by local law. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 The following table summarizes employee headcount as of the dates indicated and reflects changes resulting from the 2014 Restructuring Plan as well as new hires and terminations outside the 2014 Restructuring Plan:
