Item 1.  Business 
GENERAL 
 In this Form 10-K, all references to the “Company” or “Movado Group” include Movado Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol MOV. 
 Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes quality watches globally. Its portfolio of watch brands is currently comprised of owned brands MOVADO®, CONCORD®, EBEL®, OLIVIA BURTON® and MVMT® as well as licensed brands COACH®, TOMMY HILFIGER®, HUGO BOSS®, LACOSTE® and SCUDERIA FERRARI®. The Company is a leader in the design, development, marketing and distribution of watch brands sold in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. The Company also designs, sources, markets and distributes jewelry and other accessories under certain of its brands.
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1967 under the name North American Watch Corporation to acquire Piaget Watch Corporation and Corum Watch Corporation, which had been, respectively, the exclusive importers and distributors of Piaget and Corum watches in the United States since the 1950’s. Since then, strategic acquisitions of watch brands and their subsequent growth, along with license agreements, have played an important role in the expansion of the Company’s brand portfolio. Over time, the Company has developed its brand-building reputation and distinctive image across an expanding number of brands and geographic markets.
 In 1970, the Company acquired the Concord brand and the Swiss company that had been manufacturing Concord watches since 1908. In 1983, the Company acquired the U.S. distributor of Movado watches and substantially all of the assets related to the Movado brand from the Swiss manufacturer of Movado watches. The Company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. The Company sold its Piaget and Corum distribution businesses in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to focus on its own portfolio of brands. In March 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of Ebel, one of the world’s premier luxury watch brands which was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. In July 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Olivia Burton, which was one of the United Kingdom’s fastest-growing fashion watch and jewelry brands since its founding in 2011. In October 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of MVMT, which was founded in 2013, offering watches and accessories designed for the millennial consumer largely through a direct-to-consumer business model.
 The Company is highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands which we deem to have strong positions in their respective businesses. 
 The following table sets forth the brands licensed by the Company and the year in which the Company launched each licensed brand for watches.

COACH | Tapestry, Inc. | 1999

BRANDS 
 The Company designs, develops, sources, markets and distributes products under the following watch brands: 
 Owned Brands
 Concord 
 Concord was founded through the harmonious collaboration of five Swiss visionaries in 1908. In 1979, Concord spearheaded the Swiss quartz revolution with one of the most important watches of the twentieth century: the Concord Delirium. This was the first watch ever produced to be less than one millimeter thick – a world record to this day. To mark its 110th anniversary, Concord recently introduced a new logo depicting a knot. The knot signifies the brand’s foundation through harmonious unity and its laudable technical achievements and distinctive designs. The current Mariner SL watch captures this spirit and helps carry on Concord’s strong legacy.
Ebel 
 Ebel’s success has been built upon the fusion of technical excellence and a passion for aesthetically daring and timeless, distinctive design. A passion for innovation and excellence in watch design has always been at the heart of the Ebel brand. Ebel was founded in 1911 by husband and wife Eugène Blum and Alice Lévy, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Since its inception, Ebel has remained true to its core values, manufacturing fine Swiss watches that marry beauty and function. Ebel successfully relaunched its most iconic collection, the Ebel Sports Classic in 2017, which is renowned for its iconic bracelet design with signature wave-shaped links that helped to establish the sport-chic category in the late 70’s. Ebel continues to create timepieces that embody luxury and contemporary elegance.
Movado 
 The Movado brand is renowned for its iconic Museum® dial and modern design aesthetic. Since its founding in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1881, Movado has earned more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and technology, and Movado timepieces have won world renown for their unique beauty and timeless design.
 Movado is a hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created, most notably, the Movado Museum® Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial defined by a solitary dot at 12 o’clock, symbolizing the sun at high noon, has been acclaimed for purity of design unrivaled in the history of time-keeping. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it became the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. This legendary dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. A trademarked and award-winning design, the celebrated single dot dial now distinguishes a wide range of Movado timepieces.
 Along with its long, rich heritage of design innovation, the Movado brand experience is also defined by a close, enduring association with the arts. Expressions of Movado’s commitment to the fine and cultural arts encompass commissioned watch designs by famed artists, affiliations with talented brand ambassadors, sponsorship of major arts institutions and support of emerging artists.
 Innovative in design and materials, Movado BOLD is for the fashion-savvy, on-trend, young at heart consumer. The Movado Heritage collection launched in the spring of 2016 and is inspired by Movado’s rich history dating back before the iconic Museum dial. The collection includes new designs that are modern and relevant today by utilizing Movado’s archives.
 Olivia Burton
 Olivia Burton is a brand founded by two best friends who started out as fashion buyers who recognized a gap in the market for unique and feminine women’s watch styles. Working out of their East London studio and inspired by vintage, fashion trends and nature, the Olivia Burton design team blends contemporary and vintage styles to conceive new collections every three months. As well as innovative timepieces, including vegan, eco-friendly and unisex collections, Olivia Burton has a growing collection of jewelry styles that exhibit the same attention to detail seen in its watches.

MVMT   
 
The MVMT brand was founded in a Southern California apartment in 2013 by two entrepreneurs. Originally empowered by crowdfunding and built digitally with a community of social media followers, their philosophy was to create a brand offering quality, sleek watches that are accessible to young consumers. MVMT’s designs and messaging embody the spirit of adventuring, creating, and daring to disrupt the norm. The brand’s design catalogue has since expanded into more than 20 unique watch collections, sunglasses, blue light eyewear and jewelry. 
Licensed Brands
 Below is a description of the Company’s licensed brands.  
 Coach Watches 
 Coach watches reflect the Coach brand image and classic American style. The Coach brand stands for authenticity, innovation, and relevance, as well as effortless New York style. It is an integral part of the American luxury landscape. With an expanding presence globally, the Coach brand exemplifies modern luxury. As an extension of the brand, Coach watches offer a fresh and compelling assortment of timepieces for women and men, with a wide variety of bracelets and straps constructed of stainless steel accented with gold tone finishes and leather straps.

Scuderia Ferrari Watches 
 Asserting Scuderia Ferrari’s proud racing heritage and Italian pedigree, Movado Group’s Scuderia Ferrari watch collection offers stylish timepieces for adults and children, bringing the unparalleled excitement and distinctive style of the time-honored racing team to fans around the world. 
DESIGN AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company’s offerings undergo two phases before they are produced for sale to customers: design and product development. The design phase includes the creation of artistic and conceptual renderings while product development involves the construction of prototypes. Certain Movado watch collections, including Movado BOLD, and the Company’s licensed brand watches are designed by in-house design teams in Switzerland and the United States in cooperation with outside sources, including (in the case of the licensed brands) licensors’ design teams. Watch product development for the licensed brands, Olivia Burton, MVMT and certain Movado collections, including Movado BOLD, takes place in the Company’s Asia operations. For the Company’s Movado (with the exception of certain collections, including Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord brands, the watch design phase is performed by a combination of in-house and freelance designers in Europe and the United States while product development is carried out in the Company’s Swiss operations. For the Company’s Olivia Burton and MVMT watch brands, the design phase is performed by in-house design teams in London and Los Angeles, respectively. The Company’s jewelry and other accessories are designed by in-house design teams in cooperation with outside sources and are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia and, to a lesser extent, the United States.

MARKETING 
 The Company’s marketing strategy is to communicate a consistent, brand-specific message to the consumer. As the consumer footprint continues to evolve, the Company is increasingly focused on its digital marketing and online reach, including expanding and improving its social media channels and its messaging through individuals with significant social media followings (i.e., “influencers”). In 2018, the Company established a Digital Center of Excellence to help elevate its customers’ digital experience globally through innovative technologies and consumer-facing initiatives. Recognizing that advertising is an integral component to the successful marketing of its product offerings, the Company devotes significant resources to advertising and maintains its own in-house advertising department which focuses primarily on the implementation and management of global marketing and advertising strategies for each of the Company’s brands, ensuring consistency of presentation. The Company develops advertising campaigns individually for each of the Company’s brands, utilizing outside agencies as deemed appropriate. These campaigns are directed primarily to the end consumer rather than to trade customers. The Company’s advertising targets consumers with particular demographic characteristics appropriate to the image and price range of each brand. Company advertising is placed in magazines and other print media, on radio and television, online, including websites and social media platforms, in catalogs, on outdoor signs and through other promotional materials. Marketing expenses totaled 16.9%, 19.3%, and 15.9% of net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2021 is due primarily to the Company’s decision to decrease investments in marketing costs.
OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 The Company conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Watch and Accessory Brands and Company Stores. For operating segment data and geographic segment data for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding Segment and Geographic Information.
 The Company’s Watch and Accessory Brands segment includes the designing, manufacturing and distribution of watches and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and other accessories, of quality owned and licensed brands, in addition to revenue generated from after-sales service activities and shipping. The Company Stores segment includes the Company’s physical retail outlet locations in the United States and Canada.
 The Company divides its business into two major geographic locations: United States operations, and International, which includes the results of all non-U.S. Company operations. The vast majority of the Company’s tangible International assets are owned by the Company’s Swiss and Hong Kong subsidiaries. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s operations conducted outside the United States, see “A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business” under Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
 Watch and Accessory Brands 
 Watch and Accessory Brands Business in the United States
 The Company sells all of its brands in the U.S. Watch and Accessory Brands market primarily to department stores, such as Macy’s and Nordstrom; major jewelry store chains, such as Signet Jewelers, Ltd. and Helzberg Diamonds Corp.; independent jewelers; and online retailers, such as Amazon; as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s e-commerce platforms, such as www.movado.com and www.mvmtwatches.com. Sales to trade customers in the United States are made directly by the Company’s U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for a defined geographic territory, generally specialize in a particular brand and sell to and service independent jewelers within their territory. The sales force also consists of account executives and account representatives who, respectively, sell to and service chain and department store accounts. 
Watch and Accessory Brands Business in International Markets
 Internationally, the Company’s brands are sold to department stores, jewelry chains, independent jewelers and online retailers, as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s e-commerce platforms, such as www.oliviaburton.com and www.mvmtwatches.com. The Company employs its own international sales force operating at the Company’s sales and distribution offices in Australia, Canada, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Company sells all of its brands through a network of independent distributors operating in numerous countries around the world. A majority of the Company’s arrangements with its international distributors are long-term, generally require certain minimum purchases and minimum advertising expenditures and impose restrictions on the distributor’s sale of competitive products. 
 6


Company Stores
 The Company’s subsidiary, Movado Retail Group, Inc., operates 45 retail outlet locations in outlet centers across the United States and two retail outlet locations in outlet centers in Canada, which serve as an effective vehicle to sell current and discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the Company’s watches. 
SEASONALITY 
 The Company’s sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Consequently, the Company’s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of its fiscal year. The amount of net sales and operating profit generated during the second half of each fiscal year depends upon the general level of retail sales during the Christmas and holiday season, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The second half of each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 accounted for 68.8%, 56.6% and 60.1% of the Company’s net sales, respectively. The first half of fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the first half of fiscal year 2019 did not include any sales from MVMT since that business was not acquired until October 1, 2018.   
BACKLOG 
 At March 22, 2021, the Company had unfilled orders of $46.0 million compared to $45.0 million at March 23, 2020 and $47.2 million at March 22, 2019. Unfilled orders include both confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed based on the historical experience with the customers. It is customary for many of the Company’s customers not to confirm their future orders with formal purchase orders until shortly before their desired delivery dates. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE, WARRANTY AND REPAIR 
 The Company assists in the retail sales process of its wholesale customers by monitoring their sales and inventories by product category and style. The Company also assists in the conception, development and implementation of customers’ marketing vehicles. The Company places considerable emphasis on cooperative advertising programs with its wholesale customers. The Company’s assistance in the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing for influence on the mix and quantity. The Company believes that customers’ familiarity with its sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through its distribution network. 
 The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although the Company generally has no obligation to do so, it accepts other returns from customers in certain instances. 
 The Company has service facilities around the world, including four Company-owned service facilities and multiple independent service centers which are authorized to perform warranty repairs. A list of authorized service centers can be accessed online at www.mgiservice.com. In order to maintain consistency and quality at its service facilities and authorized independent service centers, the Company conducts training sessions and distributes technical information and updates to repair personnel. All watches sold by the Company come with limited warranties covering the movement against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase, with the exception of Tommy Hilfiger watches, for which the warranty period is two to ten years. In addition, the warranty period is five years for the gold plating on certain Movado watch cases and bracelets. Products that are returned under warranty to the Company are generally serviced by the Company’s employees at its service facilities. 
 The Company retains adequate levels of component parts to facilitate after-sales service of its watches for an extended period of time after the discontinuance of the manufacturing of such watches. 
 The Company makes available a web-based system at www.mgiservice.com providing immediate access for the Company’s retail partners to information they may want or need about after sales service issues. The website allows the Company’s retailers to track their repair status online 24 hours a day. The system also permits customers to authorize repairs, track repair status through the entire repair life cycle, view repair information and obtain service order history. 
 SOURCING, PRODUCTION AND QUALITY 
 The Company does not manufacture any of the products it sells. The Company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. All product sources must achieve and maintain the Company’s high-quality standards and specifications. With strong supply chain organizations predominantly 
 7


in Switzerland, Mainland China and Hong Kong, the Company maintains control over the quality of its products, wherever they are manufactured. Compliance is monitored with strictly enforced quality control standards, including on-site quality inspections. 
 A majority of the Swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of Movado, Ebel and Concord watches are purchased from two suppliers. The Company obtains other watch components for all of its brands, including movements, cases, hands, dials, bracelets and straps from a number of other suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term supply commitments with any of its component parts suppliers. 
 Movado (with the exception of certain Movado collections, including Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured in Switzerland by independent third-party assemblers using Swiss movements and other parts sourced by the Company’s Swiss operations. Movado smart watches include connected technology licensed from third parties that also provide end users with the necessary applications and cloud services. All of the Company’s products are manufactured using components obtained from third party suppliers. Certain Movado collections of watches, including Movado BOLD, are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia using Swiss movements. Coach, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Olivia Burton, MVMT, Scuderia Ferrari and Tommy Hilfiger watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia.

 On March 28, 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Lacoste S.A., Sporloisirs S.A. and Lacoste Alligator S.A. (the “Lacoste License Agreement”), extending the term and making certain other changes to the license agreement originally entered into by the parties in 2006, under which the Company received a worldwide exclusive license to use the LACOSTE® name and the distinctive “crocodile” logo to design, produce, market and distribute watches.

This collection launched in calendar year 2017. The current term of the Rebecca Minkoff license and collaboration agreement is through October 21, 2026. However, the Company ceased sourcing new product under this arrangement during fiscal 2021.
 Effective August 19, 2020, the Company and Calvin Klein, Inc. (“CKI”) entered into a trademark license agreement under which CKI granted the Company a worldwide license to use the trademarks CALVIN KLEIN and CK/CALVIN KLEIN in connection with the

 The Company also owns, and has pending applications for, a number of design patents in the United States and internationally for various watch designs, as well as designs of watch dials, cases, bracelets and jewelry. 
 The Company actively seeks to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights by working with industry associations, anti-counterfeiting organizations, private investigators and law enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the United States and internationally, and, when necessary, suing infringers of its trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights. Consequently, the Company is involved from time to time in litigation or other proceedings to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of these rights. The Company has registered the trademarks CONCORD®, EBEL®, MOVADO®, MVMT®, OLIVIA BURTON® and certain other related trademarks with customs authorities in the United States and certain other countries in order to assist such authorities in their efforts to prevent the importation of counterfeit goods or goods bearing confusingly similar trademarks. Customs regulations generally do not, however, protect against the unauthorized importation of genuine products. 
 COMPETITION 
 The markets for each of the Company’s watch brands are highly competitive. With the exception of Swatch Group, Ltd., a large Swiss-based competitor, no single company directly competes with the Company across all of its brands. Multiple companies, however, compete with Movado Group with respect to one or more of its watch brands. Certain of these companies have, and other companies that may enter the Company’s markets in the future may have, greater financial, distribution, marketing and advertising resources than the Company. The Company’s future success will depend, to a significant degree, upon its continued ability to compete effectively with regard to, among other things, the style, quality, price, advertising, marketing, distribution and availability of supply of the Company’s watches and other products. 
HUMAN CAPITAL 
 
The Company believes that trust, respect, passion, and teamwork are critical to achieving its goals and therefore promotes a culture built around these values. 
 
Demographics
 
The following table summarizes the Company’s global workforce as of January 31, 2021:

Attraction and Retention of Employees
 
The Company strives to attract and retain a highly talented and engaged workforce and believes that its supportive culture, dedication to employee safety and well-being, competitive compensation and benefits programs, employee development and training offerings, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and philanthropic and community engagement help in this endeavor. Approximately 35% of the Company’s non-retail employees have been with the Company for more than 10 years, and more than half have been with the Company for at least six years.
 
In light of the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took the difficult decisions to temporarily furlough a significant percentage of its employees and to lay off approximately 300 employees during fiscal 2021. The Company attempted to minimize the extent of these actions by implementing various other expense-saving initiatives as described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments and Initiatives – COVID.”
 
Employee Safety and Well-Being
 
The Company offers programs and benefits to support its employees’ physical, financial, and emotional well-being, including medical coverage, domestic partner benefits, dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, 
 9


employee assistance programs, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance, and supplemental life insurance, among others. Benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented changes that it determined were in the best interest of its employees and the communities in which they operate. This included temporarily closing offices and/or encouraging employees to work remotely whenever feasible and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Movado Company Stores were closed during periods of time; when open, the stores practiced heightened safety measures such as reduced occupancy, temperature taking, mask wearing, and increased cleanings. For a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments and Initiatives – COVID.”
 
Compensation and Financial Benefits 
 
The Company strives to offer competitive compensation packages. The Company uses a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonus, commissions, and merit increases that vary across the business. The Company also offers defined contribution savings plans to eligible employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s matching programs under these plans were temporarily suspended. 
 
In addition, as part of its long-term incentive plan for executives and key employees, the Company provides share-based compensation to foster its pay-for-performance culture and to attract, retain, and motivate participants.
 
Other financial benefits available to eligible employees include financial wellness planning and pre-retirement workshops, discounts on insurance and other products and services, and friends and family sales. Non-management employees may also receive bonuses for referring prospective new employees.
 
Benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace.
 
Employee Education, Training and Development
 
The Company encourages employees to be responsible for managing their own career goals and provides support and resources to aid employee progression.

The Company also partners with local colleges to promote deeper learning on specific topics. Tuition reimbursement is available to full-time employees in the United States.

The Company recognizes that embracing an inclusive workforce leads to greater innovation, increased productivity, and higher job satisfaction.

In furtherance of this pledge, throughout fiscal year 2020, members of the Company’s board of directors and senior leaders participated in unconscious bias training.
 
Also in fiscal year 2020, the Company joined an industry action group comprised of fashion and apparel companies committed to furthering diversity efforts in the industry, and through the group’s Open to All campaign, the Company publicly committed to making Movado Company Stores safe and inclusive places to shop for all of its diverse consumers. 
 
During fiscal year 2021, the Company formalized its Inclusion Committee, which is tasked with creating education programs for the Company’s employees and generally advising on inclusion matters.
