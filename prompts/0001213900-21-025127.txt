Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to CuriosityStream and its subsidiaries prior to and following the consummation of the Business Combination. All references in this section to Software Acquisition Group Inc. and SAQN are references to the registrant prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 
Corporate History and Background
 
 On October 14, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), CuriosityStream Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly named Software Acquisition Group Inc.) consummated a merger pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated August 10, 2020, by and among Software Acquisition Group Inc., CS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Software Acquisition Group Inc. (“Merger Sub”), CuriosityStream Operating Inc., a Delaware corporation (which has been re-named Curiosity Inc. following the Business Combination) (“Legacy CuriosityStream”), and Hendricks Factual Media LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HFM”). The transactions consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement are referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A as the “Business Combination.”

SAQN, a blank check company, was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 9, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Until the consummation of the Business Combination, SAQN did not engage in any operations nor generate any revenue. On November 22, 2019, SAQN consummated its IPO of 14,950,000 Units, which included the full exercise by the underwriter of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,950,000 Units. Each Unit consisted of one share of Common Stock and one-half of one Warrant. Each whole Warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $149,500,000.
 
CuriosityStream LLC, Legacy CuriosityStream’s predecessor, was formed in the State of Delaware in June 2008. CuriosityStream LLC officially launched its subscription service to U.S. based customers in March 2015 and to international customers in September 2015. In October 2018, Legacy CuriosityStream completed a statutory corporate conversion pursuant to which CuriosityStream LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation and renamed CuriosityStream Inc. (our “corporate reorganization”). In connection with our corporate reorganization, each membership interest of CuriosityStream LLC was converted into shares of common stock of CuriosityStream Inc. In November 2018, Legacy CuriosityStream completed a private placement of 14,557,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
Immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Legacy CuriosityStream automatically converted into an aggregate of approximately 18.4 million shares of our Common Stock. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy CuriosityStream, with Legacy CuriosityStream surviving the merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law as a wholly owned subsidiary of Software Acquisition Group Inc. (the “Merger” and, the completion of the Merger, the “Closing”). In connection with the Closing, the registrant changed its name from “Software Acquisition Group Inc.” to “CuriosityStream Inc.”
 
Our Common Stock and Warrants are listed on the NASDAQ under the symbols “CURI” and “CURIW,” respectively.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, or (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period and (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Business Overview
 
Created by John Hendricks, founder of the Discovery Channel and former Chairman of Discovery Communications, we are a media and entertainment company that offers premium video programming across the principal categories of factual entertainment, including science, history, society, nature, lifestyle and technology. Our mission is to provide premium factual entertainment that informs, enchants and inspires. We are seeking to meet demand for high-quality factual entertainment via SVoD platforms, as well as via bundled content licenses for SVoD and linear offerings, partner bulk sales, brand partnerships and content sales. We are well-positioned for growth as a digital-native video platform monetizing content across this broad revenue stack.

Through the rapid expansion of our library of high-quality titles and by exploiting multiple channels to monetize our programming, we believe that we have achieved global leadership in factual content streaming and are well positioned to capitalize on favorable ongoing industry trends to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
 
Our award-winning content library features more than 3,100 nonfiction episodes, including more than 1,000 original, commissioned or co-produced documentaries, of short-form, mid-form and long-form duration, with an estimated $1 billion original production value. Our films are produced, co-produced or commissioned by us, or licensed through one of our content partnerships, such as with NHK in Japan, ZED in France and Terra Mater in Austria. Our programs are hosted by and feature scientists, experts and celebrities, such as Stephen Hawking, Sir David Attenborough and Sigourney Weaver. Our programs have already received three Emmy nominations, including an Emmy Award win for Stephen Hawking’s Favorite Places. Every title on our platform is available on-demand and, other than historical footage or classic documentaries, in high definition or 4K quality.
 
Our content, approximately one-third of which is originally produced with the remaining two-thirds consisting of licensed programming, is available directly through our O&O Service and App Services. Our App Services enable access to CuriosityStream on almost every major consumer device, including streaming media players like Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, all major smart TV brands (e.g., LG, Vizio, Samsung, Sony) and gaming consoles like Xbox. In addition, we have affiliate agreement relationships with, and our service is available directly from, MVPDs that include Comcast, Cox, Dish and NCTC and vMVPDs and digital distributors that include Amazon Prime Video Channels, Roku Channels, Sling TV and YouTube TV, which we refer to as our “Partner Direct Service” or “Partner Direct Business.”
 
Our Direct Service is available in more than 175 countries to any household with a broadband connection for $2.99 per month or $19.99 per year for high-definition resolution. We also provide a premium service in 4K resolution for $9.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Over 75% of Direct Service subscribers select annual subscription plans, which has reduced subscriber churn and facilitates our ability to learn and serve consumer preferences. The MVPD, vMVPD and digital distributor partners making up our Partner Direct Business pay us a license fee for sales to individuals who subscribe to CuriosityStream via the partners’ respective platforms.
 
The technology associated with our Direct Business is designed to facilitate a consistent user experience across the different interface platforms and operating system applications. We provide value for both our users and ourselves through our analytics algorithm and data collection system. Leveraging our database of anonymized user preferences, ratings and behavior, we are constantly refining our content recommendation engine to suggest and serve content to our customers.
 
In addition to our Partner Direct Services and Businesses, we have affiliate relationships with our Bundled MVPD Partners — MVPDs, broadband and wireless companies in the US and international territories to whom we can offer a broad scope of rights, including 24/7 “linear” channels, our on-demand content library, mobile rights and pricing and packaging flexibility, in exchange for an annual fixed fee or fee per subscriber as part of a multi-year agreement. This Bundled MVPD Business offers us the advantages of long-cycle and recurring revenue and the potential to access hundreds of millions of paying subscribers globally. As a young and digital-native company, we are not laden with some of the overhead costs nor over-dependent on lines of business that may hamper the growth of legacy media companies. We are consequently able to offer Bundled MVPD Partners more attractive rates than well-known conglomerates, meeting the Bundled MVPD Partners’ need to cut costs in their business without losing quantity or quality of factual content.
 
Our Corporate & Association Partnership business has been comprised primarily of selling subscriptions in bulk to companies and organizations that in turn offer these subscriptions to their employees and members as an employment benefit or “gift of curiosity.” As a family-friendly and enriching service, we are well-positioned among media companies to continue to build our roster of customers in this model. We see an even bigger opportunity with corporations and associations, however, via multi-year integrated partnerships where we create and distribute content in support of these partners’ CSR and membership initiatives.

Our Sponsorship & Advertising Business consists of developing integrated digital brand partnerships designed to offer blue chip brands the chance to be associated with CuriosityStream content in a variety of forms, including short and long form program integration, branded social media promotional videos, broadcast advertising spots, and digital display ads.
 
Our Program Sales Business is focused on providing factual content to entertainment media companies. We have the opportunity to provide a turnkey, financially attractive “factual solution” to meet this business demand. We are able to sell to certain media companies a collection of our existing titles in a traditional program sales deal and are party to a multi-year, multi-million dollar program sales agreement with one such media company. We are also able to sell selected rights (such as in territories or on platforms that are lower priority for us) to content we create before we even begin production. This latter model reduces risk in our content development decisions and creates program sales revenue.
 
The most basic functional structure of our company thrives due to the collaboration of (1) our content team, which works with more than 150 production companies and distributors across the world to create and acquire programming, (2) our legal and finance teams, which structure and formalize agreements, (3) our creative services and content operations teams, which develop all of the marketing materials, metadata and other assets associated with a piece of content, and (4) our content operations and technology teams, which then deliver our content and services to all manner of devices and streaming platforms for our Direct, Partner Direct, Bundled MVPD and other businesses.
 
 Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $39.6 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $48.6 million. 
 
 Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for a more detailed discussion of our product and service lines and channels through which we generate revenue. 
 
Competition
 
We compete for the time and attention of our users across different forms of media, including traditional broadcast, cable, satellite and internet-delivered video, other providers of SVoD services (Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix), other providers of in-home and mobile entertainment such as radio, music streaming services, and social media and networking websites. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another.
 
We compete to attract, engage, and retain users with other content providers based on a number of factors, including the user experience, content range and quality, ease of use of our platform, price, accessibility, perceptions of advertising load, brand awareness and reputation.
 
Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, legacy operating histories and larger marketing and content budgets, as well as greater financial, technical, human and other resources. However, we currently face limited competition in the factual SVoD category.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and proprietary rights arrangements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and we control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.
 
Our registered trademarks in the United States include “Curiosity” and “CuriosityStream.”
 
We are the registrant of the internet domain name for our website, www.curiositystream.com, as well as others. We own rights to proprietary processes and trade secrets, including those underlying the CuriosityStream service.

In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to, and use of, our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with contractors, customers and partners. Our employees sign acknowledgements of our policies with respect to confidentiality and proprietary rights.
 
Government Regulation
 
As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to information and network security, data protection, privacy, and governmental access to data, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted, updated, or new laws passed in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information and network security and data protection, the laws in the United States, the European Union (the “EU”), and other jurisdictions globally can require specified actions to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of networks and data. Notwithstanding any activities to secure networks and data, security for networks and data cannot be guaranteed. Cyber incidents can and do happen. Additionally, laws in many U.S. states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of personally identifiable information. Credit card networks may also require us to employ certain security and privacy controls, and failure to comply with these obligations may lead to significant liabilities. Likewise, U.S. states, the EU, China, and other jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users, regulators, and sometimes law enforcement if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of information, including personal information and personally identifiable information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws, obligations, or regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We may also be subject to U.S. federal and state, EU and other foreign laws regarding privacy, the collection of the data of minors, and the privacy of customer data. Our privacy policy and terms of use describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of customer information and are posted on our website. Any failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy-related laws, obligations, or regulations globally could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities, individuals, or others, which could harm our business. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy or security of our customers’ information could result in a loss of confidence in our service among existing and potential customers, and ultimately, in a loss of customers and advertisers, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Privacy Policy
 
We collect and use certain types of information from our customers in accordance with the privacy policy that is posted on our website. We collect personally identifiable information directly from customers when they register to use our service and sign up to receive email newsletters. We may also obtain information about our customers from other customers and third parties. Our policy is to use the collected information to customize and personalize advertising and content for customers and to enhance the customer experience when using our service.
 
We also use automated data collection technology, such as tracking cookies, to collect non-personally identifiable information in order to help us track customer interactions with our service. Third-party advertisers and service partners may also use tracking technologies in order to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding use of our platforms.
 
We have implemented commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
 
Employees and Human Capital 
 
In 2020 and 2019, we had approximately 54 and 47 total, full-time employees on average, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 63 full-time employees, all of whom were located in the U.S. We have one location, a corporate office plus filming studio and edit suites, in Silver Spring, Maryland (the “Office”). Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. Our ability to attract, retain and improve the effectiveness of our employees is a critical factor for executing our growth strategy. We strive to recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences.

We are committed to diversity and inclusion as well as equitable pay within our workforce. To further some of these initiatives, for example, in the third quarter of 2020, we retained Willis Towers Watson, a leading global advisory firm, to review our compensation structure. Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees and executives and is comprised of a mix of competitive base salary, bonus and equity compensation awards, as well as other employee benefits. Currently all employees receive equity grants with vesting conditions designed to facilitate the retention of personnel and the opportunity to benefit financially from the Company’s growth and profitability.
 
 Our human resource strategy is overseen by our Chief Operating Officer and executive team, which aims to provide regular updates to our Board. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
 
In addition, the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to protect our workforce, including:
 

● | Mandating remote work other than certain employees who at various times may be required to work in the Office to conduct minimal operations to meet business objectives; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing additional cleaning and sanitization practices on top of the robust sanitization protocols already undertaken in the Office; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing touchless contact points for most doors in the Office; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing physical distancing procedures for employees in the Office;

● | Implementing HEPA air filter system in the conference room in the Office; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Installing self-service hand sanitizer dispensers in the Office. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The safety and well-being of our employees is of critical importance to us to attract and retain top performers and execute on our growth strategy.
