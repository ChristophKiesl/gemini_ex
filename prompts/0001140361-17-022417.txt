History
 
Modine was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on June 23, 1916 by its founder, Arthur B. Modine.  Mr. Modine’s “Turbotube” radiators became standard equipment on the famous Ford Motor Company Model T.  When he died at the age of 95, A.B. Modine had personally been granted more than 120 U.S. patents for his heat transfer innovations.  The standard of innovation exemplified by A.B. Modine remains the cornerstone of Modine today.
Terms and Year References
 
When we use the terms “Modine,” “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “our” in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Modine Manufacturing Company.  Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and, accordingly, all references to a particular year mean the fiscal year ended March 31 of that year, unless indicated otherwise.
Business Strategy and Results
 
Modine pursues market leadership by being a customer-focused, global company delivering exceptional quality, innovation and value. We will grow our core business of thermal management with superior technical solutions in systems, products and services – coupled with a cost competitive structure.
 
During fiscal 2016, we launched our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow strategic transformation in order to best position our business for long-term success.  We aimed to strengthen our business by, among other things, right-sizing our cost structure and implementing a more global, product-based organization to capture synergies across our core businesses, effectively meet the needs of our global customers, and improve our speed to market.  In addition, we aimed to diversify by expanding our presence in non-vehicular markets, and grow through both organic and inorganic investments.
 
On November 30, 2016, we addressed our “Diversify” and “Grow” commitments in particular by completing our acquisition of Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions (“Luvata HTS”) for consideration totaling $415.6 million ($388.2 million, net of cash acquired).
 
 1
 

Luvata HTS, a leading global supplier of coils, coolers and coatings to the HVAC&R industry, generated more than $500 million of net sales in calendar 2016.  The acquisition of Luvata HTS increased our industrial business portfolio, broadened our customer base, reduced cyclical exposure, and expanded our growth profile.  Commencing from the acquisition date, we have operated Luvata HTS as our Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) business segment.  We are actively engaged in integration activities and expect to realize cost synergies through procurement savings, operational improvements, and organizational efficiencies over three to four years.  In addition, we anticipate revenue synergies through expanded sales channels and cross-selling opportunities resulting from our highly-complementary product portfolios.
 
Our top five customers are in three different markets – automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway – and our ten largest customers accounted for 54 percent of our fiscal 2017 sales.  In fiscal 2017, 62 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 55 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 7 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2016, 63 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 54 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 9 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2015, 64 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 55 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 9 percent generated by exports from the U.S.
 
During fiscal 2017, our consolidated net sales were $1.50 billion, an 11 percent increase from $1.35 billion in fiscal 2016.  The increase from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $178 million of incremental sales from our new CIS segment and higher sales in our Asia segment, partially offset by lower sales in our Americas and Building HVAC (“BHVAC”) segments.  Our operating income of $39 million in fiscal 2017 included costs directly related to our acquisition and integration of Luvata HTS totaling $15 million and, as compared with the prior year, was favorably impacted by pension settlement losses totaling $42 million in fiscal 2016.
 
In support of our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow strategic platform and in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, we have engaged in various restructuring activities.  As a result, we recorded $11 million of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2017, primarily related to equipment transfer and plant consolidation activities and severance expenses.
 
A key metric by which we measure our performance is return on average capital employed (“ROACE”).  We define ROACE as operating income, plus restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and adjustments, impairment charges, and excluding certain other gains or charges, less income tax at a 30 percent rate and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest; divided by the average of debt plus Modine shareholders’ equity.  Our ROACE declined 150 basis points in fiscal 2017 to 6.9 percent compared with 8.4 percent in fiscal 2016.  ROACE in fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by higher capital employed resulting from our acquisition of Luvata HTS, including goodwill and intangible assets totaling $281 million.

ROACE is not a measure derived under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP.  We believe that ROACE provides investors with helpful information about our performance, our ability to provide an acceptable return on capital, and our ability to fund future growth.  This measure may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other companies.  The following schedule provides a reconciliation of ROACE to operating income, as presented in accordance with GAAP:

Competitive Position
 
We compete with many manufacturers of heat transfer and HVAC&R products, some of which are divisions of larger companies.  The markets for our products continue to be very dynamic.  Our traditional OEM customers are faced with dramatically increased international competition and have expanded their global manufacturing footprints to compete in local markets.  In addition, consolidation within the supply base and vertical integration has introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets.  Some of these market changes have caused us to experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower healthcare costs, and lower tax rates.  As a result, we have expanded and continue to expand our geographic footprint, in part to provide more flexibility to serve our customers around the globe.  Many of our customers also continue to ask us, as well as their other primary suppliers, to provide research and development (“R&D”), design, and validation support for new potential projects.  This combined work effort often results in stronger customer relationships and more partnership opportunities for us.

Business Segments
 
We have assigned specific operations to segments based principally upon defined markets and geographic locations.  Each operating segment is managed by a vice president and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  These results are used by management in evaluating the performance of each business segment and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses.  Financial information related to our operating segments is included in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Vehicular Businesses
 
Americas, Europe, and Asia Segments
 
The continued globalization of our vehicular customer base requires us to manage our strategic approach, product offerings and the competitive environment on a global basis.  This trend offers significant opportunities for us with our market positioning, including our presence in key vehicular markets (U.S., Europe, China, Mexico, Brazil, India, South Korea, and Japan) and a global product-based organization with the expertise to solve technical challenges.  We are recognized for having strong technical support, an extensive product portfolio, and the ability to provide global standard designs for our customers. Many vehicular OEMs continue to expect cost reductions from suppliers while requiring a consistent level of quality.  In addition, these OEMs seek new technology solutions at low prices for their thermal management needs.  In general, this creates challenges for us and the entire supply base, but also provides an opportunity for suppliers, like Modine, who develop innovative solutions at a competitive cost.
 
Each of our main vehicular competitors, AKG Group, BorgWarner, Dana Corporation, Delphi Corporation, Denso Corporation, Mahle Behr, Tata Toyo, TitanX, T. Rad Co. Ltd., UFI Filters, Valeo SA, Hanon Systems, and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery Co. Ltd., have a multi-regional or worldwide presence.  Increasingly, we face heightened competition as these competitors expand their product offerings and manufacturing footprints through expansion into lower-cost countries or lower-cost sourcing initiatives.  In addition, competitors from some lower-cost regions are beginning to expand into new geographical markets.
 
The Americas, Europe, and Asia segments represent our vehicular businesses and serve the automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway markets.  In addition, our Americas segment provides custom-designed heat exchangers, utilizing microchannel, heat recovery, and round tube plate fin coils, to the commercial refrigeration, residential heating, and commercial heating and air conditioning markets.  We view our Americas coils products as highly-complementary to those of our new CIS segment.  As part of our CIS integration activities, we will merge our Americas coils business into CIS and expect to achieve operational improvements and organizational efficiencies as a result.  The Americas segment also serves Brazil’s automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets.  The following summarizes the primary markets served by our vehicular segments:
 
Automotive
 
Market Overview – The global automotive market improved in most regions during fiscal 2017.  We expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2018, supported by global fuel efficiency standards, in-vehicle technology enhancements and growth in emerging markets.  We are beginning to see the automotive market focus less on traditional internal combustion engines and more on alternative powertrains, such as electric, hybrid, and fuel cell.  Global automotive OEMs and their powertrain suppliers are engaged in significant development activities for these alternative powertrains.  In addition, a number of start-up companies, specialized in electric vehicles, are working towards establishing themselves in the marketplace.  We expect this shift will increase the thermal management requirements for these vehicles, and we are capitalizing on this trend by applying our base heat transfer components to new applications.  We expect our global automotive market production to increase in fiscal 2018, particularly driven by market improvements and maturing program volumes in China and new program launches in our Americas and Europe segments.

Commercial Vehicle
 
Market Overview – During fiscal 2017, the North America commercial vehicle market weakened, particularly the market for heavy-duty trucks.  In fiscal 2018, we expect this market will remain relatively flat compared with the prior year. Slow economic growth conditions, excess inventory and rising safety standards suggest uneven demand in fiscal 2018.  In South America, we expect the commercial vehicle market will stabilize in fiscal 2018 and remain relatively flat compared with fiscal 2017, after experiencing significant volume declines in recent years.  In Europe, the commercial vehicle market experienced moderate growth in fiscal 2017; however, we expect the market to remain flat in fiscal 2018.  In Asia, we anticipate continued market growth at a moderate rate during fiscal 2018.
 
Other trends influencing the commercial vehicle market include a call by global commercial vehicle manufacturers to standardize U.S., Canadian, and Eurozone emissions regulations.  Global standardization would likely lead to further consolidation of our customer base and competitors, as they leverage higher volumes, consolidate development activities, and rationalize distribution channels.  Additionally, truck manufacturers are evaluating alternative powertrains and fuels, including electrification, waste heat recovery, and other technologies aimed to improve vehicle efficiency, all of which could present opportunities for us.  These trends are driving the advancement of product development worldwide and are creating demand for incremental improvements to thermal transfer products, which we are well positioned to support.

Primary Competitors – Mahle Behr; TitanX; T. Rad Co. Ltd.; BorgWarner; and Tata Toyo.
 
Off-Highway
 
Market Overview – Many global off-highway markets declined during fiscal 2017.  The construction market was mixed in fiscal 2017, as some regions showed signs of modest improvement during the year while others remained depressed.  The U.S. agricultural market remained under pressure from low commodity prices and associated demand, a trend that we expect to continue in fiscal 2018.  We expect this market will continue to be negatively impacted by higher used equipment inventories, which could suppress new equipment sales, and the uncertain interest rate environment.  The mining equipment markets are showing small signs of improving in fiscal 2018.  Many mining equipment buyers continued to cut capital investment plans in fiscal 2017, as the market progressed through a multiple-year cycle of demand declines.  The European construction and agricultural equipment markets declined slightly in fiscal 2017; however, we expect gradual growth in these markets during fiscal 2018.  In South America, we expect the off-highway markets will stabilize in fiscal 2018 and be relatively flat compared with fiscal 2017, after experiencing significant volume declines in recent years.  In Asia, a recovery in construction markets began in the second half of fiscal 2017, and we expect continued improvement in the China and Korea excavator markets in fiscal 2018.
Products – Powertrain cooling (engine cooling modules, radiators, condensers, charge air coolers, fuel coolers and oil coolers); auxiliary cooling (power steering coolers and transmission oil coolers); and on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake air coolers).

Export sales from the U.S. to foreign countries as a percentage of consolidated net sales were 7 percent in fiscal 2017 and 9 percent in both fiscal 2016 and 2015.
 
We believe our international presence positions us to share profitably in the anticipated long-term growth of the global vehicular and commercial, industrial and building HVAC&R markets.  We are committed to increasing our involvement and investment in international markets in the years ahead.
Foreign and Domestic Operations
 
Financial information relating to our foreign and domestic operations is included in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Customer Dependence
 
Our ten largest customers, certain of which are conglomerates, accounted for 54 percent of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017.  These customers, listed alphabetically, were: Carrier, Caterpillar; Daimler AG (including Daimler Trucks, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks and Western Star Trucks); Deere & Company; Denso Corporation; FCA Italy S.p.A. (including Chrysler, CNH, Fiat, Iveco, and VM Motori); Navistar (including MWM International); Volkswagen AG (including Audi, MAN, Porsche, and Scania); AB Volvo (including Mack Trucks and Renault Trucks); and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.  In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG each accounted for 10 percent or more of our sales.  In addition, the financial results of our CIS segment include significant sales (7 percent of segment sales in fiscal 2017) from a global technology customer, whose identity we cannot disclose due to confidentiality requirements, to which sales have historically fluctuated significantly from one quarter or fiscal year to the next.  Generally, we supply products to our customers on the basis of individual purchase orders received from them.  When it is in the mutual interest of Modine and our customers, we utilize long-term sales agreements to minimize investment risks and provide the customer with a proven source of competitively-priced products.  These contracts are typically three to five years in duration.

Backlog of Orders
 
Our operating segments maintain their own inventories and production schedules.  We believe that our current production capacity is capable of handling the sales volume expected in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
Raw Materials
 
We purchase aluminum, nickel and steel from several domestic and foreign suppliers.  In general, we do not rely on any one supplier for these materials, which are, for the most part, available from numerous sources in quantities required by us.  The supply of copper and brass material is highly concentrated between two global suppliers.  We normally do not experience raw material shortages and believe that our suppliers’ production of these metals will be adequate throughout the next fiscal year.  We typically adjust metals pricing with our raw material and major fabricated component suppliers on a quarterly basis.  When possible, we have made material pass-through arrangements with key customers, which allow us to adjust customer prices, on a prospective basis, based upon increases and decreases in the cost of key raw materials.  When utilized, however, these pass-through arrangements are typically limited to the underlying cost of the material based upon the London Metal Exchange, and do not include related premiums or fabrication costs.  In addition, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag between the time of the material price increase or decrease and the time that we adjust the price with our customer.
Patents
 
We own or license numerous patents related to our products and operations.  These patents and licenses have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times.  Because we have many product lines, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. We consider each of our patents, trademarks and licenses to be of value and aggressively defend our rights throughout the world against infringement. We have been granted and/or acquired more than 2,300 patents worldwide over the life of our company.
Research and Development
 
We remain committed to our vision of creating value through technology and innovation.  We focus our engineering and R&D efforts on solutions that meet challenging heat transfer needs of OEMs and other customers within the automotive, commercial vehicle, construction, agricultural, and commercial, industrial, and building HVAC&R markets.  Our products and systems are often aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management.  Typical market demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight, more compact, more efficient and more durable to meet customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements.  Our heritage includes a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that, combined with our global manufacturing presence, standardized processes, and state-of-the-art technical resources, enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to our customers.
 
R&D expenditures, including certain application engineering costs for specific customer solutions, totaled $64 million, $61 million, and $62 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  Over the last three years, R&D expenditures have been between 4 and 5 percent of our consolidated net sales.  This level of investment reflects our continued commitment to R&D in an ever-changing marketplace.  To achieve efficiencies and lower development costs, our R&D groups work closely with our customers on special projects and system designs.  Projects include EGR technology, charge air coolers and battery thermal management systems for the automotive, commercial vehicle, agriculture, construction, and residential and commercial energy storage markets, which enable our customers to meet more stringent emission and energy efficiency standards.  Most of our current R&D activities are focused on internal development in the areas of powertrain cooling, engine cooling, building HVAC, and commercial and industrial thermal management products.  We also collaborate with several industry, university, and government-sponsored research organizations that conduct research and provide data on practical applications in the markets we serve.  We continue to identify, evaluate and engage in external research projects that complement our strategic internal research initiatives in order to further leverage our significant thermal technology expertise and capabilities.
 
Quality Improvement
 
Through our global Quality Management System (“QMS”), our manufacturing facilities and administrative offices in our Americas, Europe and Asia segments are registered to ISO 9001:2008 or ISO/TS 16949:2009 standards, helping to ensure that our customers receive high quality products and services.  We have begun to transition to ISO 9001:2015 and IATF 16949:2016 standards.   While customer expectations for performance, quality and service continue to rise, our QMS has allowed us to drive improvements in quality performance and has enabled the ongoing delivery of products, service and value that meet or exceed customer expectations.

Our global QMS operates within the context of the Modine Operating System (“MOS”), which focuses on well-defined improvement principles and leadership behaviors to engage our teams in facilitating rapid improvements.  We drive sustainable and systematic continuous improvement throughout all operating segments and functional areas of the organization by utilizing the principles, processes and behaviors that are core to these systems.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
We are committed to preventing pollution, eliminating waste and reducing environmental risks.  Our facilities maintain Environmental Management System (“EMS”) certification to the international ISO14001 standard through independent third-party audits.  Our locations have established specific environmental improvement targets and objectives for the upcoming fiscal year.  As part of our integration activities with our new CIS segment, we are assessing and harmonizing the environmental, health and safety policies and practices at CIS segment facilities with those of Modine.  As such, our discussion in this section primarily excludes consideration of these recently-acquired operations.
 
In fiscal 2017, our carbon emission levels, primarily resulting from on-site use of natural gas and propane, and use of electricity generated by off-site sources, were consistent with the prior year.  We will continue to identify and implement carbon reduction opportunities when feasible in fiscal 2018.  Our commitment to environmental stewardship is reflected in the results of our reporting of chemical releases, as monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Chemical Release Inventory program.  Our U.S. locations decreased their reported chemical releases by 98 percent over the 10-year period from 2005 to 2015.  This long-term improvement is the result of manufacturing efficiencies and our transition to more environmentally-friendly manufacturing technologies and raw materials.
 
Our product portfolio reflects our sense of environmental responsibility.  We continue to develop and refine environmentally-friendly product lines, including oil, fuel, and EGR coolers for gas and diesel applications, light-weight and high-performance powertrain cooling heat exchangers, and our Advanced Cooling System technology.  These products provide increased fuel economies and enable combustion technologies that reduce harmful gas emissions. Our Building HVAC segment offerings, including the Airedale SchoolMate® water source heat pump; the EffinityTM, a condensing gas-fired unit heater with industry-leading efficiencies; the AtherionTM Commercial Packaged Ventilation System; and the completely redesigned GeoSyncTM geothermal heat pump featuring our patented CFTM microchannel coil with the highest heating efficiencies in its class.  These products are helping commercial, industrial and residential users achieve high energy efficiencies and reduce utility costs.
 
Obligations for remedial activities may arise at our facilities due to past practices, or as a result of a property purchase or sale.  These expenditures most often relate to sites where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable under then-existing regulations, but now require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure appropriate environmental protection or where we are a successor to the obligations of prior owners and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance.  Environmental liabilities for investigative work and remediation at sites in the U.S. and abroad, including at CIS sites, totaled $17 million at March 31, 2017.
 
We recorded a fiscal 2017 global Recordable Incident Rate (“RIR” as defined by OSHA) of 1.31, which represents an improvement of 20 percent compared with our fiscal 2016 rate of 1.63.  We have consistently out-performed the private-industry RIR average for the manufacturing sector, which, by comparison was 3.8 in 2015.
 
Our behavior-based safety program is a proactive global effort under which we seek to correct at-risk behaviors, and positively reinforce safe behaviors. As an example of our proactive efforts, we recently introduced process stream safety to our Americas segment facilities.  This in-depth evaluation and correction of workplace conditions further engages employees to eliminate safety risks. Our focus on behavior-based safety and process stream safety are part of our long-term commitment to strengthen our safety culture.  As part of our integration activities, we are actively engaged in implementing our behavior-based safety program at our recently-acquired CIS locations.

Employees
 
We employed approximately 11,200 persons worldwide as of March 31, 2017.
 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 
Our overall operating performance is generally not subject to a significant degree of seasonality, as sales to OEM customers are dependent upon market demand for new vehicles.  However, our second fiscal quarter production schedules are typically impacted by customer summer shut downs and our third fiscal quarter is affected by holiday schedules.  Additionally, our CIS and BHVAC segments experience some seasonality as demand for HVAC&R products can be affected by heating and cooling seasons, weather patterns, construction, and other factors.  We expect sales volume within our CIS segment to be higher during our first two fiscal quarters due to the construction seasons in the northern hemisphere.  Sales volume within the BHVAC segment is generally stronger in our second and third fiscal quarters, corresponding with demand for heating products.
Working Capital
 
We manufacture products for the majority of customers in our vehicular and CIS segments on an as-ordered basis, which makes large inventories of finished products unnecessary.  In our BHVAC segment, we maintain varying levels of finished goods inventory due to seasonal demand and certain sales programs.  In Brazil, within our Americas segment, we maintain higher levels of aftermarket product inventory in order to timely meet customer needs in the Brazilian automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets.  We do not experience a significant number of returned products within any of our operating segments.
