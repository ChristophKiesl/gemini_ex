Item 1. Business
The Company
We operate 268 senior living communities, including one active adult community, located in 32 states and provide services to approximately 26,000 residents. We have achieved J.D. Power Senior Living Certification for 32 of our senior living communities as of December 31, 2019.
With our new mission, “To honor and enrich the journey of life, one experience at a time,” we are a leadership team committed to prioritizing the needs of our residents, clients and team members. With approximately 23,000 team members experienced in supporting older adults, we are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults and their caregivers. 
As of December 31, 2019, our residents resided in (i) 257 primarily independent and assisted living communities and (ii) 11 skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. Our independent and assisted living communities, which includes our Bridge to Rediscovery memory care units, consists of 30,021 living units. These units include 31 continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, with 7,070 living units, and our SNFs consist of 1,264 living units. As of December 31, 2019, we leased and operated 170 of these 268 senior living communities (18,840 living units), owned and operated 20 of these senior living communities (2,108 living units) and managed 78 of these senior living communities (10,337 living units), including one active adult community (169 living units).
With the goal of offering a comprehensive suite of services, which includes our rehabilitations and wellness division, Ageility Physical Therapy Solutions, or Ageility, we provide our residents and others with rehabilitation and wellness services at our senior living communities as well as at outpatient clinics located separately from our senior living communities. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 41 inpatient clinics providing rehabilitation services in 34 of our CCRCs and seven of our SNFs. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 190 outpatient clinics, of which 150 were clinics within our senior living communities and 40 were clinics with other senior living companies. We provided Ageility services to approximately 10,000 clients in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we have expanded our Ageility service line by introducing innovative fitness and personal training offerings to complement outpatient therapy in nine active adult communities.
According to the Longevity Economy Outlook, AARP with The Economist, as of December 31, 2019, the over 50 age population in the United States was comprised of 117.4 million people, or 35% of the population. The fastest growing age population in the United States is the over 85, and the second fastest is the over 100. We believe our business has the platform and service offerings to position us to support a higher quality of life for these adults as they age.
We are focused on (i) creating experiences for older adults that meet their expectations and (ii) offering residences and services that meet the needs and demands of older adults. To that end, we collaborate and actively engage with innovative organizations. We also sponsor and pilot programs to continually evolve our service capabilities to meet the needs of our residents and team members and we adapt our offerings to meet the evolving consumer demands of a growing population of older adults. In 2019, we served approximately 27,000 older adults on a daily basis by providing a variety of living experiences and services in addition to delivering ancillary services, such as through Ageility. For our residents in our assisted living and SNF communities, we offer assistance with their daily living activities, including bathing and dressing, eating, toileting and agility and mobility assistance. In certain communities, we also provide licensed skilled nursing services. In addition, we offer additional services including, but not limited to, on-site entertainment, personal grooming services and home health and dining services. Our focus on offering a broad array of services helps promote a greater sense of community and enable older adults to age-in-place independently.

Restructuring with DHC
On April 1, 2019, we entered into a transaction agreement, or the Transaction Agreement, with DHC to restructure our business arrangements with DHC, or the Restructuring Transactions, pursuant to which, effective as of January 1, 2020, or the Conversion Time:

• | our five then existing master leases with DHC for 166 of DHC's senior living communities (18,636 living units) that we then leased, as well as our then existing management and pooling agreements with DHC for 78 senior living communities (10,337 living units) were terminated and replaced, or the Conversion, with new management agreements for all of these senior living communities and a related omnibus agreement, or collectively, the New Management Agreements;


• | we issued 10,268,158 of our common shares to DHC and an aggregate of 16,118,849 of our common shares to DHC’s shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019, or, together, the Share Issuances; and


• | as consideration for the Share Issuances, DHC provided to us $75.0 million of additional consideration by assuming certain of our working capital liabilities (with DHC's provision of such consideration to us, collectively with the Conversion and the Share Issuances, being included in the definition of Restructuring Transactions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

In connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a credit agreement with DHC pursuant to which DHC
extended to us a $25.0 million line of credit, or the DHC credit facility, which was secured by six senior living communities we own. The DHC credit facility matured and was terminated in connection with the completion of the Restructuring Transactions. There were no amounts outstanding under the DHC credit facility at the time of such termination and we did not make any borrowings under the DHC credit facility during its term.
Also in connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we agreed to expand our Board of Directors within six months following the Conversion Time to add an Independent Director (as defined in our bylaws) reasonably satisfactory to DHC. On February 26, 2020, our Board of Directors elected Michael E. Wagner, M.D. as an Independent Director, which satisfied our agreement with DHC to expand our Board of Directors.
For more information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see "Properties" included in Part I, Item 2, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Notes 1 and 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our History
We are a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Maryland in 2001. Effective March 3, 2017, we changed our name from Five Star Quality Care, Inc. to Five Star Senior Living Inc. Since then we have grown primarily by leasing or managing communities acquired by DHC. We also offer rehabilitation and wellness services both at our senior living communities as well as in communities of other senior living companies. Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8387.
Our Communities and Our Services
Our present business plan contemplates the operation of owned, managed and leased independent and assisted senior living communities. Our communities can be classified into different primary service categories; while some provide a single service, others provide multiple services in a single building or campus. The majority of the senior living communities we operate are organized in campus-like settings or stand-alone communities containing multiple service levels. 
Independent Living Communities. Independent living communities provide residents with high levels of privacy in various types of apartments and require residents to be relatively independent. An independent living apartment usually bundles several non-healthcare services as part of a regular monthly charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly housekeeping service or planned activities. Additional non-healthcare services are generally available from staff employees on a fee for service basis. Included in independent living communities are 31 CCRC communities, as well as independent living communities that provide both assisted living and skilled nursing services in separate parts of the community. As of December 31, 2019, our operations included 11,364 independent living apartments in 97 communities. We also have an active adult community, which we classify as an independent living community.
2

Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one-bedroom units, which include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community, as requested, or at regularly scheduled times. We may also provide Alzheimer’s or memory care services at certain of our assisted living communities through our award winning Bridge to Rediscovery program. As of December 31, 2019, our operations included 16,470 assisted living suites in 229 communities.
Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs generally provide extensive nursing and healthcare services that are similar to services available in hospitals, without the high costs associated with operating theaters, emergency rooms or intensive care units. A typical purpose-built SNF includes one or two beds per room with a separate bathroom in each room and shared dining facilities. SNFs are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. As of December 31, 2019, our operations included 3,451 SNF units in 49 communities.
Rehabilitation and Wellness Services. Our rehabilitation and wellness services are offered by Ageility. Ageility’s services are primarily clinically based rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. Ageility also offers other rehabilitation and wellness services with a hospitality approach, including strength training, orthopedic rehabilitation, fall prevention, cognitive or memory enhancement, aquatic therapy, continence management programs, pain management programs, neurological rehabilitation, post-surgical or post-hospitalization services and general personal fitness and wellness programs. The clinics are staffed with licensed therapists or other trained personnel. 

Current Industry Trends
While the construction of new senior living communities is starting to slow down, it has experienced in the past several years significant construction of new communities and other buildings to service older adults. We believe this resulted in an oversupply and put downward pressures on occupancy and the rates that operators can charge for their services to their residents. In addition, pressures on governmental budgets has resulted in reductions or limitations on the growth of government funding for senior living and healthcare services, despite the increasing regulatory requirements imposed on the industry. These revenue pressures have been buffeted by increased costs for labor, insurance and regulatory compliance. At the same time, older adults are delaying the age at which they move to senior living communities, or forgoing such a move entirely. 
In the last ten years, as the industry evolved to serve the growing number of older adults, it was also facing the impacts of an economic recession. We have searched for innovative ways to overcome the industry's challenges that include workforce shortages and low retention, occupancy pressures, challenges related to new technology and the increasing desire for exceptional customer experience including concierge level services.
To address workforce and retention challenges, senior living companies like us have looked to data-driven recruitment processes that use benchmarking and analytics to find quality candidates who stay in their roles longer. Personnel retention plans also include increasing wages, especially in geographic areas where competition for healthcare and senior living professionals is fierce. Other innovative efforts to attract talent to the senior living industry include connecting to the future workforce through school partnerships and recruitment presentations.
To address occupancy challenges, we are investing in business intelligence, website enhancements and technology-enabled marketing to understand market demands and adapt its service offerings to attract families and individuals searching for the services they need for their aging loved ones or themselves. In addition, we have increased our use of sales training that focuses on research-based sales tactics to more effectively “close” the prospects generated by technology with a genuine, human touch.
In the technology arena, demographic trends regarding aging adults have captured the attention of a number of entrepreneurs, start-ups and other companies, resulting in a steady stream of innovations entering the senior living space. Many of these innovations enable older adults to age in their own existing homes longer. Technology is causing the industry to look at new ways of delivering care to older adults. Regardless of the influx of technology solutions that change how senior living companies deliver older adult care, the senior living industry remains a person-to-person, relationship-centered business. Technology can augment, but we believe, will never replace the human touch, friendship and compassion of individuals of all ages who feel called to care for and honor the generations who came before them.
Recent trends suggest older adults are focused on evaluating senior living communities that offer service platforms that enable individuals to live a more independent lifestyle. With a broader scope of senior living communities operating in the 
United States, combined with technology enablement, consumers have more options in choosing where to live as they age. This wider range of options for consumers is causing further pressure on the industry to implement innovative methods and services that provide for an exceptional customer experience.
Competition
The senior living services business is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and some of our competitors are not-for-profit entities that have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. Also, in recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and we expect this increased development activity to continue in the future. This activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in the geographic markets where we have high concentrations of senior living communities. 
We continue to address competition (i) by focusing on operations to ensure an exceptional resident experience, high customer satisfaction and employee retention through, among other things, training and development, (ii) by differentiating ourselves with the innovative programs and services we offer, (iii) with enhanced marketing efforts and (iv) by evaluating the current position of our communities relative to their competition. In addition, we may enter additional arrangements with DHC for us to operate new or additional senior living communities including active adult communities that DHC owns, and our relationships with DHC and RMR LLC may provide us with competitive advantages; however, DHC is not obligated to provide us with opportunities to operate additional properties it owns. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully or operate profitably. For more information on the competitive pressures we face and associated risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Growth Strategy 
We are one of the largest senior living management companies in the United States, based on unit count, and we have been in operation for over 18 years currently servicing approximately 26,000 older adults in our senior living communities as well as approximately 10,000 clients in our Ageility clinics. As the demographics and psychographics of our prospective customers change, we are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults and their caregivers.
We seek to improve revenues from our existing senior living operations by focusing on an exceptional resident experience for those who pay with private resources. We also seek to improve profitability through continued strategic capital investments at our senior living communities and investments in the development of our staff, as well as by working with service providers to increase the desirability and competitiveness of our senior living communities. In addition to routine renovations and upgrades at our existing senior living communities, since January 1, 2018, we have invested $106.5 million in capital improvements in our senior living communities. 
We also seek to grow our business by entering additional long-term management agreements for senior living communities and active adult communities where residents’ private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. In 2018 and 2019, we sold four senior living communities, all of which we previously owned and operated, to DHC and began managing those communities for the account of DHC upon completion of each sale. In 2018 and 2019, we also began managing three DHC owned senior living communities and one active adult community for the account of DHC. For more information about the sale transactions, see “Our Dispositions” included in Part I, Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about our management and prior leasing arrangements with DHC, see “Properties — Our DHC Leases and Management Agreements with DHC” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Through our ancillary services, we provide diversified offerings to older adults within our communities and outside, including skilled rehabilitation services for short-term inpatient stays, such as after joint replacement surgery; home healthcare in certain of our independent living and assisted living communities; outpatient rehabilitation focused on older adults; and concierge services. The therapy services we offer include physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services. The home health services we provide include nursing, physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services, home health aide services, and social services, as needed. In addition, we offer personalized concierge services to accommodate our residents’ specific lifestyle and needs. Concierge services include personal shopping, companion services, enhanced transportation, bedtime assistance, and personalized dining and nutrition planning, delivery and consultation. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, which we believe may encourage our customers to reside with us for a longer period. 
Since January 1, 2018, we have opened 101 rehabilitation and wellness outpatient clinics. We also expanded our rehabilitation and wellness services to senior living communities outside of our current operations. In addition, we continue to seek ways to grow our other ancillary services that complement our existing senior living operations to residents of the senior living communities we operate as well as older adults living outside of our communities. 
We also continue to develop public awareness of the Five Star Senior Living brand through various marketing initiatives that we believe differentiate us from other senior living operators. For example, we offer “Lifestyle360”, a wellness program focused on five dimensions of wellness (social, intellectual, spiritual, emotional and physical). We believe that programs like “Lifestyle360” will enhance the appeal of our senior living communities among current and prospective residents and their families and provide us with an opportunity to improve our operating performance. 
Our expansion efforts are currently focused on internal growth through effective management of our existing portfolio, by increasing occupancy, as well as by increasing revenues from our ancillary services, such as outpatient therapy services and health and wellness and concierge services, to residents of the senior living communities we operate as well as older adults living outside of our communities. We may also agree to operate additional senior living communities and active adult communities for the account of DHC or other third parties pursuant to management arrangements and, from time to time, we may acquire and operate additional senior living communities.
Recent Developments
Portfolio Optimization Through Dispositions. We continually monitor our portfolio of senior living communities and other assets, and we seek to dispose of, or change our method of operating, certain of our senior living communities if and when we determine it is in our best interest to do so and we are able to reach an agreement regarding the sale or change of our method of operating of such communities with our pre-existing contracting parties, including DHC. Since January 1, 2018, we have sold or participated in the sale of 23 senior living communities that we or DHC owned and we operated.
Portfolio Optimization Through Expansion Activities. We currently expect that our expansion activities will be focused on internal growth from our existing senior living communities and entering into additional long-term management agreements for senior living communities, as well as the growth of ancillary service offerings, including rehabilitation and wellness services and other home-based service offerings. 

In June 2018, DHC acquired an additional living unit at a senior living community that we leased from DHC located in Florida which was added to the then existing lease for that senior living community.
We also began managing communities for the account of DHC, pursuant to a management agreement and/or our then existing pooling agreements, as amended and restated, senior living communities owned by DHC as follows:

Month | State | Units
June 2018 | California | 98 
November 2018 | Colorado | 238 
April 2019 | Oregon | 318 
December 2019 | Texas | 169 
Total | | 823 

Effective January 1, 2020, our then existing management and pooling agreements with DHC for these communities were terminated and replaced with New Management Agreements in connection with the Restructuring Transactions.
For more information about our dispositions, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about our former leases and our management arrangements with DHC, see “Properties—Our Leases and Management Agreements with DHC” in Part I, Item 2 and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financing Sources
Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations are cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash balances and borrowings under our $65.0 million secured revolving credit facility, which is available for general business purposes. Our credit facility matures in June 2021, and, subject to our payment of an extension 
fee and meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the stated maturity date of our credit facility for a one-year period. We are required to pay interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium of 250 basis points per annum, or at a base rate, as defined in the agreement governing our credit facility, or our credit agreement, plus 150 basis points per annum on borrowings under our credit facility. The annual interest rates as of December 31, 2019, were 4.20% and 6.25%, respectively. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.35% per annum on the unused part of the available borrowings under our credit facility. No principal repayment is due until maturity. For more information about our credit facility, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
On January 1, 2020, as part of the Restructuring Transactions, we issued 10,268,158 of our common shares to DHC and an aggregate of 16,118,849 of our common shares to DHC’s shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019, or, together, the Share Issuances. As consideration for the Share Issuances, DHC provided to us $75.0 million of additional consideration by assuming certain of our working capital liabilities.
In addition, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a credit agreement with DHC for the DHC credit facility, which was secured by six senior living communities we own. The DHC credit facility matured and was terminated on January 1, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Restructuring Transactions. There were no borrowings outstanding under the DHC credit facility at the time of such termination and we did not make any borrowings under the DHC credit facility during its term. 
For more information about our credit facility and the DHC credit facility, see Notes 8 and 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the future, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire in the future, or place mortgages on properties we own or seek to obtain other additional sources of financing, including term debt or issuing equity or debt securities. We currently have mortgage debt that we assumed in connection with a previous acquisition of one of our properties.
Operating Structure
We have four operating divisions. Three of these divisions are responsible for senior living communities located in specified geographic regions. Each region’s management is responsible for independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing units within its specified region. A divisional vice president, with extensive experience in the senior living industry, manages one of our divisions from one of our regional offices. Our regional offices are responsible for the senior living communities we operate that are located within a designated geographic region and are led by regional directors of operations that have extensive experience in the senior living industry. Each of our regional offices is typically supported by a clinical or wellness director, a regional accounts manager, a human resources specialist, a food services specialist and a sales and marketing specialist. Regional office staff members are responsible for all senior living community operations within their designated geographic region, including:

• | resident services;


• | sales and marketing;


• | hiring of community personnel;


• | compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and


• | supporting our development and acquisition plans within their region.

Our fourth division is responsible for rehabilitation and therapy services and is headed by a vice president at our corporate office who has extensive experience in rehabilitation services and is supported by a network of divisional and regional directors of rehabilitation services that are assigned to specified geographic regions.
Our corporate headquarters staff is responsible for corporate level systems, policies and procedures, such as:

• | company-wide policies and procedures;


• | human resources and team member engagement;


• | marketing and communications;


• | resident experience;


• | information technology services;


• | licensing and certification maintenance;


• | legal services and regulatory compliance;


• | centralized purchasing and cash disbursements;


• | financial planning and analysis;


• | budgeting and supervision of maintenance and capital expenditures;


• | implementation of our growth strategy; and


• | accounting, auditing and finance functions, including operations, budgeting, certain accounts receivable and collections functions, accounts payable, payroll, tax and financial reporting.

As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we have a business management agreement with RMR LLC, pursuant to which RMR LLC provides to us certain business management services, including services related to compliance with various laws and rules applicable to our status as a publicly traded company, including our internal audit function, capital markets and financing activities and investor relations.
Employees and Staffing
As of February 26, 2020, we had approximately 23,600 employees, including approximately 15,600 full time equivalents. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Our employees predominately work collaboratively in our communities that have different staffing requirements further described below: 
Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of our independent and assisted living communities has an executive director that is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the applicable community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision, as applicable. The executive director is supported by department managers who oversee the care and service of our residents, a wellness director who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the care needs of our residents and a sales director who is responsible for sales and promoting our services and brand. These communities also typically have a dining services coordinator, an activities coordinator, a business office manager and a property maintenance coordinator.
Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing. Each of our SNFs is managed by a state licensed administrator who is supported by other professional personnel, including a director of nursing, an activities director, a marketing director, a social services director, a business office manager and physical, occupational and speech therapists. Our directors of nursing are state licensed nurses who supervise our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition vary among our SNFs depending on the size and occupancy of, and the type of care provided at, the applicable SNF. Our SNFs also contract with physicians who provide certain administrative, clinical and oversight services.
Government Regulation and Reimbursement
The senior living and healthcare industries are subject to extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure, personnel training, staffing ratios, types and quality of medical care, physical facility requirements, government healthcare program participation, fraud and abuse, payments for patient services and patient records.
We are subject to, and our operations must comply with, these laws and regulations. From time to time, our communities receive notices from federal, state and local agencies regarding noncompliance with such requirements. Upon receipt of these notices, we review them for accuracy and, based on our review, we either take corrective action or contest the allegation of noncompliance. When corrective action is required, we work with the relevant agency to address and remediate 
any violations. Challenging and appealing any notices or allegations of noncompliance require the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any one of our communities may have an adverse impact on our licensing and ability to operate and attract residents to other communities.

The healthcare industry depends significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is affected by the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for skilled nursing, physical therapy and rehabilitation and wellness services provided operating revenues at our outpatient clinics and some of our senior living communities (principally our SNFs). We derived approximately 21.5% and 23.3% of our consolidated senior living revenues from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In addition to existing government regulation, we are aware of numerous healthcare regulatory initiatives and fair housing laws on the federal, state and local levels, which may affect our business operations if implemented.
Independent Living Communities. Government benefits are not generally available for services at independent living communities, and residents in those communities use private resources to pay for their living units and the services they receive. The rates in these communities are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. However, a number of federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled recipients to live in these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements that may be subject to these state standards include independent living communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, in many jurisdictions, they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food service establishments in addition to complying with land use and life safety requirements. In addition, in some states, state or county health departments, social service agencies and/or offices on aging have jurisdiction over group residential communities for older adults and license independent living communities. To the extent that independent living communities include units to which assisted living or nursing services are provided, these units are subject to applicable state licensing regulations. If the communities receive Medicaid or Medicare funds, they are subject to certification standards and requirements that they must meet, or the Conditions of Participation. In some states, insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services.
Assisted Living Communities. A majority of states provide or are approved to provide Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and other home and community based services by various means such as restrictive financial and functional eligibility standards, enrollment limits and waiting lists. Because rates paid to assisted living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to SNF operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities.
As a result of a large number of states using Medicaid funds to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, all states regulate assisted living and residential care communities, although states do not use a uniform approach. Most state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding. Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few states require certificates of need, or CONs, from state health planning authorities before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of recent economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon Medicaid or other government payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted living communities located in states that adopt CON requirements or other limitations on the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because those limitations may help ensure higher nongovernment rates and reduced competition.
HHS, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, have studied and reported on the development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long-term care and as an alternative to 
SNFs. Since 2003, CMS has commenced a series of actions to increase its oversight of state quality assurance programs for assisted living communities and has provided guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs.
CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community based services as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or the DRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs. One such program, the Community First Choice Option, or the CFC Option, grants states that choose to participate in the program a 6% increase in federal matching payments for related medical assistance expenditures. According to CMS, as of January 2019, eight states had approved CFC Option programs. We are unable to predict the effect of the implementation of the CFC Option and other similar programs, but their impact may be adverse and material to our operations and our future financial results of operations.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Medicare Reimbursement. A majority of all SNF revenues in the United States comes from publicly funded programs. According to CMS, Medicaid is the largest source of public funding for SNFs, followed by Medicare. For example, in 2016 approximately 31% of SNF and continuing care retirement community revenues came from Medicaid and 23% from Medicare. In November 2019, CMS proposed new reporting requirements for state supplemental payments to Medicaid providers and limitations on approvals to state plan amendments for payments for services at long-term care facilities, including SNFs. The finalization of the proposal could impact the availability of supplemental Medicaid payments to SNFs.
SNFs are highly regulated businesses. The federal and state governments regularly monitor the quality of care provided at SNFs. State health departments conduct surveys of resident care and inspect the physical condition of SNF properties. These periodic inspections and occasional changes in life safety and physical plant requirements sometimes require SNF operators to make significant capital improvements. These mandated capital improvements have usually resulted in Medicare and Medicaid rate adjustments, albeit on the basis of amortization of expenditures over the expected useful lives of the improvements. 
Under the Medicare SNF prospective payment system, or SNF PPS, capital costs are part of the prospective rate and are not community specific. The SNF PPS and other recent legislative and regulatory actions with respect to state Medicaid rates limit the reimbursement levels for some SNF services. At the same time, federal and state enforcement agencies have increased oversight of SNFs, making licensing and certification of these communities more rigorous.
CMS implemented the SNF PPS pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Under the SNF PPS, SNFs receive a fixed payment for each day of care provided to residents who are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare SNF PPS payments cover substantially all services provided to Medicare residents in SNFs, including ancillary services such as rehabilitation services. The SNF PPS historically required SNFs to assign each resident to a care group depending on that resident’s medical characteristics and service needs using a resident assessment instrument called the Minimum Data Set 3.0. These care groups were known as Resource Utilization Groups, or RUGs, and CMS establishes a per diem payment rate for each RUG.
On July 31, 2018, CMS finalized its proposal to replace the RUG model, with a revised case-mix methodology called the Patient-Driven Payment Model, or PDPM, which became effective October 1, 2019. The PDPM focuses on clinically relevant factors, rather than volume-based payment, by using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and other patient characteristics as the basis for patient classification. PDPM will eliminate the need for SNFs to use Minimum Data Set 3.0 to assign residents to a care group. Therapy reimbursement will be linked to patient diagnoses with higher reimbursements being provided to higher-acuity patients. As a result, initial patient assessments, including obtaining full clinical documentation from hospitals and accurately applying ICD-10 coding to reflect a patient’s full clinical status, will become increasingly important factors in reimbursement. CMS estimates that paperwork simplification related to patient assessments will reduce reporting burdens for SNFs by approximately $2.0 billion over 10 years. With regard to Medicaid, in an update to PDPM guidance issued on April 4, 2019, CMS will permit states to continue reimbursement based on the state’s previous Medicaid SNF payment system, rather than requiring conversion to PDPM by October 1, 2020.

On July 30, 2019, CMS issued the latest SNF prospective payment system final rule for federal fiscal year 2020, which CMS estimates will increase Medicare payments to SNFs by approximately $851 million for federal fiscal year 2020, or 2.4%, compared to federal fiscal year 2019. It is unclear whether these adjustments in Medicare rates will compensate for the increased costs we may incur for services to our residents whose services are paid for by Medicare. 
The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, enacted in February 2012, incrementally reduced the SNF reimbursement rate for Medicare bad debt from 100% to 65% by federal fiscal year 2015 for beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Because a majority of SNF bad debt has historically been related to dual eligible beneficiaries, this rule has a substantial negative effect on SNFs, including some that we operate. The same law also reduced the SNF Medicare bad debt reimbursement rate for Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for Medicaid from 70% to 65% in federal fiscal year 2013 and going forward.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allow for automatic reductions in federal spending by means of a process called sequestration, which reduces Medicare payment rates by 2.0% through 2023. In subsequent years, Congress approved additional extensions of Medicare sequestration, through 2029. Medicaid is exempt from the automatic reductions, as are certain Medicare benefits. The automatic 2.0% payment cuts took effect in April 2013 and had an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Subsequent legislation appears to have modified some aspects of the sequestration process, but at this time it is unclear what impact this legislation may have on Medicare payments we receive. Any future reductions in Medicare payment rates could be adverse and material to our operations and financial results. 
We are unable to predict the impact of on us of these or other recent legislative or regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare rates received by our facilities.

Skilled Nursing Facilities - Medicaid Reimbursement. Although Medicaid is exempt from the sequestration process described above, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce, Medicaid rates. Some states are expanding their use of managed care, partly to control Medicaid program costs. According to a report by CMS Office of the Actuary in February 2018, Medicaid enrollment is estimated to have increased 11.9% in 2014, 4.9% in 2015, 3.0% in 2016, and 2.0% in 2017, due primarily to the expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, which began in 2014. In 2019, Medicaid enrollment declined (1.7%) and is projected to modestly increase 0.8% in 2020, which moderation in growth we believe is due to a strong economy, changes in the renewal process and enhanced verification and data matching systems.
In January 2018, CMS issued a letter to State Medicaid Directors announcing that CMS would support state efforts to test incentives that make participation in work or other community engagement a requirement for continued Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly, non-pregnant adults. States would be required to have exemptions for individuals who are classified as “disabled” for Medicaid eligibility purposes, as well those with acute medical conditions or medical frailty that would prevent them from complying with the work requirement. As of December 2019, previously approved work requirements implemented in Arkansas, Kentucky and New Hampshire had been suspended by federal courts. Arkansas’s work requirements were later struck down by a federal appeals court panel and Kentucky’s governor rescinded the state’s work requirement waiver. Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin have received CMS approval but have not yet implemented or have suspended implementation of work requirements. In addition, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia have submitted requests to modify their respective state Medicaid plans to include work requirements. The implementation of work requirements may reduce the availability of Medicaid coverage within our patient population.
Some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce Medicaid rates. Effective June 30, 2011, Congress ended certain temporary increases in federal payments to states for Medicaid programs that had been in effect since 2008. We expect the ending of these temporary federal payments, combined with other state budgetary pressures, to result in continued challenging state fiscal conditions, particularly in those states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. As a result, some state budget deficits may increase, and certain states may continue to reduce Medicaid payments to healthcare providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets. These state level cuts have the potential to negatively impact our revenue from Medicaid sources.
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates, the federal payments to states for Medicaid programs, Medicaid program design and Medicaid eligibility standards.
Skilled Nursing Facilities – Provider Reimbursement. The outpatient therapy revenue received by our providers is tied to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, which has historically been subject to limitations on the amount of therapy services that can be provided, as well as limitations on annual cost growth. 
In 2006, Medicare payments for outpatient therapies became subject to payment limits. The DRA created an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare. In April 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, extended the Medicare outpatient therapy cap exception process through March 2015, postponing the implementation of firm limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. In April 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which extended the outpatient therapy cap exceptions process from March 2015 through December 2017, further postponing the implementation of strict limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 permanently repealed the caps, effective January 1, 2018.
In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, and Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, which together CMS calls the Quality Payment Program.  These reforms were mandated under MACRA and replace the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, methodology for calculating updates to the MPFS. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. MIPS consolidates the various CMS incentive and quality programs into a single reporting mechanism. Providers will receive either incentive payments or reimbursement cuts based on their compliance with MIPS requirements and their performance against a mean and median threshold of all MIPS eligible providers. CMS expanded the definition of MIPS-eligible clinicians to include physical and occupational therapists. APMs are innovative models approved by CMS for paying healthcare providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that draw on existing programs, such as the bundled payment and shared savings models. 
In addition, under MACRA, there were and will be MPFS conversion factor updates of 0.0% from January 2015 through June 2015, 0.5% from July 2015 through December 2015, and 0.5% each year from 2016 through 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 reduced the conversion factor for 2019 from 0.5% to 0.25%. For 2020 through 2025, the conversion factor will be further reduced to 0.0%.
In November 2019, CMS published a final rule that updates the MPFS for the calendar year 2020 and changed other Medicare Part B policies. In particular, the rule continued to implement a statutory requirement that claim modifiers be used to identify certain therapy services that are furnished in whole or in part by physical therapy assistants, or PTAs, and occupational therapy assistants, or OTAs, beginning January 1, 2020. CMS has adopted a standard that, when more than 10% of the service is furnished by a PTA or OTA, then the service is considered to be furnished “in whole or in part” by a PTA or OTA. CMS proposes to base the 10% calculation on the therapeutic minutes of time spent by the therapist versus a PTA or OTA. Beginning January 1, 2022, claims that contain a therapy assistant modifier will be paid at 85% of the otherwise applicable payment amount.
Our Medicare Part B outpatient therapy provider revenue rates are tied to the MPFS and may be affected by these modifications; however, we are unable to predict the impact of these modifications on the Medicare rates received by our providers.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Quality Improvement, Pay-for-Performance and Value-Based Purchasing Initiatives. In addition to the reimbursement and rate changes discussed above, payments to SNFs will be increasingly determined by the quality of care provided. The federal government has enhanced its focus on developing and imposing quality-related regulations, standards and programs to improve the quality of care provided at SNFs and to better align payment to quality outcomes. As mandated by MACRA, PAMA and the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, or the IMPACT Act, CMS established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program and the SNF Quality Reporting Program to achieve these goals. 
The IMPACT Act established the SNF Quality Reporting Program, under which SNFs are required to report certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format and to report certain patient assessment data in such a format. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, SNFs that failed to comply with the reporting requirements by the established times are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. Beginning in October 2018, SNF Quality Reporting Program data is publicly available on CMS’ Nursing Home Compare website.
PAMA established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program, under which HHS will assess SNFs based on hospital readmissions and make these assessments available to the public. In the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2016, CMS adopted a 30-day all-cause, all-condition hospital readmission measure for SNFs, which was replaced with an all-condition, risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission rate measure in the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2017. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs’ performance scores on this measure. The 2020 federal fiscal year update adopted two new quality measures to assess whether certain health information is provided by the SNF at the time of transfer or discharge. The update also adopted several standardized patient assessment data elements. To 
fund the program, CMS will reduce Medicare payments to all SNFs by 2.0% through a withhold mechanism starting in October 2018 and then redistribute approximately 60% of the withheld payments as incentive payments to those SNFs with the highest rankings on this measure. CMS estimates that the federal fiscal year 2020 changes to the SNF VBP program will decrease payments to SNFs by an aggregate of approximately $213.6 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2019. 

In August 2015, CMS announced that it would conduct the second phase of another SNF quality improvement program, the Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalizations Among Nursing Facility Residents, a pilot program first announced in 2012, which will be continued in partnership with selected organizations from October 2016 to October 2020. In this phase of the initiative, participants will test whether a new payment model for SNFs and practitioners, together with clinical and educational interventions that participants are currently implementing, will further reduce avoidable hospitalizations, lower combined Medicare and Medicaid spending and improve the quality of care received by long stay SNF residents. As of December 2019, six organizations had cooperative agreements with CMS to implement this phase of the initiative, and over 247 long-term care facilities were selected to participate. 
As these quality improvement initiatives increase in size and scope, the federal government will likely monitor the impact of these programs more closely. We are unable to predict the impact of these quality improvement initiatives on our Medicare reimbursement rates or the cost of our SNFs’ operations. 
Other legislative proposals introduced in Congress, proposed by federal or state agencies or under consideration by some state governments include the option of block grants for states rather than federal matching money for certain state Medicaid services, laws authorizing or directing Medicare to negotiate rate reductions for prescription drugs, additional Medicare and Medicaid enforcement procedures and federal and state cost containment measures, such as freezing Medicare or Medicaid SNF payment rates at their current levels and reducing or eliminating annual Medicare or Medicaid inflation allowances or gradually reducing rates for SNFs. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. 
Skilled Nursing Facilities – Conditions of Participation. CMS maintains and enforces Conditions of Participation that healthcare organizations must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These standards are designed to improve the quality of care and protect the health and safety of beneficiaries. Through the Conditions of Participation, CMS is able to require certain quality standards protocols, including most recently, requiring SNFs to implement a quality assurance and performance improvement program.
In September 2016, CMS released a final rule to comprehensively update the Conditions of Participation for long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. The final rule, which went into effect beginning in November 2016, institutes a broad range of new requirements, some of which stem from statutory modifications under the ACA and the IMPACT Act. In particular, the final rule requires our SNFs, in a multi-phased approach over the next few years, to: train staff on care for residents with dementia and on abuse prevention; consider residents’ health needs when making decisions about the kinds and levels of staffing; ensure that staff have the appropriate skills and competencies to provide individualized, resident centered care; augment care planning activities, including considering residents’ goals and preferences and, on discharge, giving residents necessary follow up information and improving communication with receiving facilities or services; permit dietitians and therapy providers to write orders under certain circumstances; meet heightened food and nutrition services requirements; implement an updated infection prevention and control program, including requiring each of our SNFs to designate an infection prevention and control officer; and strengthen residents’ rights. In addition, the final rule requires our SNFs to: alter their staffing levels and competencies based on the results of mandated facility assessments; develop, implement and maintain a compliance and ethics program and a quality assurance and performance improvement program; and implement new practices surrounding the preparation and implementation of care plans and discharge summaries, among other new requirements. These requirements will increase the cost of operations for long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, including our SNFs. Specifically, CMS estimated in the final rule that the cost of complying with all of the new requirements per facility would be approximately $62,900 in the first year, and approximately $55,000 each year thereafter. However, we believe new requirements often cost considerably more than CMS estimates.
In July 2019, CMS announced two rules - one final and one proposed - to further update requirements that long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid must meet. Specifically, the final rule repeals the prohibition on the use of pre-dispute, binding arbitration agreements by long-term care facilities. The final rule also imposes certain safeguards intended to increase the transparency of arbitration agreements used by long-term care facilities, as well as the related arbitration process, including requiring that a facility not require any resident or his or her representative to sign an arbitration agreement as a condition of admission to the facility. Under the proposed rule, CMS proposes to further reform the 
requirements for long-term care facilities by eliminating or reducing certain requirements deemed unnecessary, obsolete, or excessively burdensome. Notably, CMS put forward proposals to modify certain requirements related to grievance policies, infection control staffing, and compliance program requirements, among other changes. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations.
Skilled Nursing Facilities - Survey and Enforcement. Pursuant to the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, Congress enacted major reforms to federal and state regulatory systems for SNFs that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since then, the GAO has reported that, although much progress has been made, substantial problems remain in the effectiveness of federal and state regulatory activities. The HHS Office of Inspector General, or the OIG, has issued several reports concerning quality of care and billing practices in SNFs, and the GAO has issued several reports recommending that CMS and states strengthen their compliance and enforcement practices, including federal oversight of state actions and to ensure that SNFs provide adequate care and states act more consistently. Moreover, in its fiscal year 2017 work plan and subsequent monthly updates, the OIG specifically stated that it will review compliance with various aspects of the SNF PPS, including the documentation requirement in support of claims paid by Medicare, and assess the incidence of serious quality of care issues, such as abuse and neglect. In recent years, the OIG and the GAO have also repeatedly called for increased oversight and payment system reform for SNFs.

In August 2017, the OIG issued an early alert regarding preliminary results of its ongoing review of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs. As a result of the review, which is part of the ongoing efforts of the OIG to detect and combat elder abuse, the OIG concluded that CMS has inadequate procedures to ensure that incidents of potential abuse or neglect of beneficiaries residing in SNFs are identified and reported. The OIG provided suggestions for immediate actions that CMS can take to ensure better protection of beneficiaries. It is unclear what policy changes or oversight efforts CMS will undertake as a result of this early alert.
In addition to scrutiny from the GAO and the OIG, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and other congressional committees have also held hearings on related SNF issues. As a result, CMS has undertaken several initiatives to increase the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid SNF survey and enforcement activities. CMS has been taking steps to identify and focus enforcement efforts on SNFs and chains of SNF operators with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicare and Medicaid standards. CMS has also increased its oversight of state survey agencies and has improved the process by which data is captured from these surveys. As an added measure of improving patient care, the ACA provides for the funding of a state background check system for job applicants to long-term care providers who will have direct access to patients. CMS has begun the administration of this program, and, as of January 2018, had awarded funding to approximately half of the states.
In addition, CMS adopted regulations expanding federal and state authority to impose civil monetary penalties in instances of noncompliance. When CMS or state agencies identify deficiencies under state licensing and Medicare and Medicaid standards, they may impose sanctions and remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, civil monetary penalties, state oversight, temporary management or receivership and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure on SNF operators. Our communities may incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. If we are unable to cure deficiencies that have been identified or that are identified in the future, or if appeals of proposed sanctions or penalties are not successful, decertification or additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed. These consequences may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Certificates of Need. As a mechanism to prevent overbuilding and subsequent healthcare price inflation, many states limit the number of SNFs by requiring developers to obtain CONs before new facilities may be built or additional beds may be added to existing facilities. As noted above, a few states also limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring CONs. In addition, some states (such as California and Texas) that have eliminated CON laws have retained other means of limiting new development, including moratoria, licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. These government requirements limit expansion, which we believe may make existing SNFs more valuable by limiting competition.
Healthcare Reform. The ACA has resulted in changes to insurance, payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. The ACA was intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, including expansion of access to Medicaid coverage, and reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while simultaneously maintaining or improving the quality of healthcare. The ACA also encouraged the development and testing of bundled payment for services models, the development of Medicare value-based purchasing plans as well as several initiatives to encourage states to develop and expand home and community based services under Medicaid. Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, whereas others took effect or will take effect at later dates. Recently, the ACA has been subject to significant reform, repeal and revision efforts by the executive 
and legislative branches of the federal government and subject to changes resulting from lawsuits filed with the judicial branch of the federal government. It is unclear what the result of any of these legislative, executive and regulatory reform efforts may be or the effect they may have on us, if any. For example:

• | In June 2017, HHS solicited suggestions for changes that could be made within the existing ACA legal framework to improve health insurance markets and meet the Trump Administration’s reform goals. HHS sought comments from interested parties to inform its ongoing efforts to create a more patient-centered healthcare system that adheres to the key principles of affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation and empowerment.


• | On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that modified certain aspects of the ACA. Specifically, the executive order directed federal agencies to reduce limits on association health plans and temporary insurance plans, allowing more widespread offerings of plans that do not adhere to all of the ACA’s mandates, and to permit workers to use funds from tax advantaged accounts to pay for their own coverage. On October 2, 2018, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, and CMS issued regulations to permit insurers to sell short-term plans that provide coverage for up to 12 months; previous Obama Administration guidance had limited such plans to 90 days. Short-term plans are often less expensive than plans that meet the requirements of the ACA; however, short-term plans are also exempt from the ACA’s essential health benefits and other consumer protection requirements. In addition, on October 22, 2018, CMS announced that future Section 1332 of the ACA state health insurance innovation waivers may include short-term or association health plans as having coverage comparable to ACA plans.


• | On October 12, 2017, the Trump Administration also announced that it would stop paying what are known as cost sharing reduction subsidies to issuers of qualified health plans under the ACA. As a result, in 2018 payors generally increased premiums for plans offered on exchanges in order to make up for termination of federal cost sharing reduction subsidies.


• | In 2018, the ACA was also subject to lawsuits that sought to invalidate some or all of its provisions. In February 2018, a lawsuit brought federal district court in Texas by 18 attorneys general and two governors in federal district court argued that, following the legislative repeal of the ACA mandate’s tax penalties by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (which set the penalty to $0), the entire ACA should be enjoined as invalid. On December 14, 2018, the district court found that the ACA, following the mandate repeal, was unconstitutional. Following the ruling, additional state attorneys general intervened as defendants in the case and on December 30, 2018, the court granted the intervenor defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal.


• | In January 2019, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the intervenor defendants appealed the district court’s 2018 decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 18, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in a 2-1 opinion that the ACA’s individual mandate was unconstitutional, but, rather than determining whether the remainder of the ACA is valid, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for additional analysis on severability.

If the ACA is repealed, replaced or modified, additional regulatory risks may arise and our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected. We are unable to predict the impact of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates and federal Medicare rates and federal payments to states for Medicaid programs discussed above on us. The changes implemented or to be implemented as a result of such actions could result in the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or private payment reimbursement rates to cover increasing costs, in a reduction in payments or other circumstances.
Regulatory Reform. In the fall of 2019, the Trump Administration, including HHS, updated its “Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,” which lists the scope and anticipated timing of pending and future regulations. In releasing the agenda, the Administration highlighted its “ongoing progress toward the goals of more effective and less burdensome regulation,” which appears to be consistent with Executive Order 13771’s mandate to eliminate two economically significant regulations for every regulation added. It is unclear how these regulatory reform efforts will impact our operations. Some of the regulatory updates described above may in the future, be repealed, replaced or modified as a result of these regulatory reform efforts. For instance, in the latest update, HHS and CMS stated their intent to propose changes to the current Conditions of Participation or Conditions for Coverage that healthcare organizations must meet in order to begin and continue participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This may include additional changes to the Conditions of Participation for long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. 
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other regulatory reform efforts. While these efforts could ultimately decrease the regulatory burden for our operations in the long-term, they may increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.
Enforcement. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti‑kickback, physician referral (including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989), privacy and consumer protection laws by providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, treble damages, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. The FCA, as amended and expanded by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the ACA, provides significant civil monetary penalties and treble damages for false claims and authorizes individuals to bring claims on behalf of the federal government for false claims. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose substantial civil penalties, treble damages and program exclusions administratively for false claims or violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, the ACA increased penalties under federal sentencing guidelines by between 20% and 50% for healthcare fraud offenses involving more than $1.0 million. State Attorneys General typically enforce consumer protection laws relating to senior living services, clinics and other healthcare facilities.
Government authorities are devoting increasing attention and resources to the prevention, detection and prosecution of healthcare fraud and abuse. The OIG has guidelines for SNFs intended to assist them in developing voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse; these guidelines recommend that CMS identify SNFs that are billing for higher paying RUGs and more closely monitor their compliance with patient therapy assessments as methods of fraud prevention. CMS contractors are also expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. 
The ACA facilitates the DOJ’s ability to investigate allegations of wrongdoing or fraud at SNFs, in part because of increased cooperation and data sharing among CMS, the OIG, the DOJ and the states. In 2019, the DOJ announced two settlements with SNF facilities and their affiliates for $2 million and $10 million, as well as a $44 million judgment, relating to allegedly unnecessary rehabilitation therapy services provided to SNF patients. The significant nature of the settlements indicates that the federal government is increasingly focused on the appropriateness of billing practices of, and medical necessity of services provided at, SNFs. The DOJ has also established 10 regional intergovernmental Elder Justice Task Forces across the country to identify and take enforcement action against SNFs that provide substandard care to residents. In September 2019, the DOJ announced that it intends to identify criminal charges, such as wire fraud or healthcare fraud, that can be brought alongside civil actions against SNFs and employees accused of abusing or defrauding elderly patients.
In addition, the ACA requires all states to terminate the Medicaid participation of any provider that has been terminated under Medicare or any other state Medicaid plan. Moreover, state Medicaid fraud control agencies may investigate and prosecute assisted living communities and SNFs, clinics and other healthcare facilities under fraud and patient abuse and neglect laws. We expect that increased enforcement and monitoring by government agencies will cause us to expend considerable amounts on regulatory compliance and likely reduce the profits available from providing healthcare services. 
Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in closure of the community and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Some states and the federal government allow certain citations of one community to impact other communities operated by the same entity or a related entity, including communities in other states. Revocation of a license or certification at one of our communities could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our management agreements with DHC and our credit facility or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. In addition, an adverse finding by state officials could serve as the basis for lawsuits by private plaintiffs and lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which could result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community as well as a related entity.
Other Matters. Our communities must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, our communities must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and also with security rules for electronic PHI. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for noncompliance with these laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of 
$1.5 million per calendar year. In January 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which went into effect in March 2013 and required compliance with most provisions by September 2013. The Omnibus Rule modified various requirements, including the standard for providing breach notices, previously required an analysis of the harm of any disclosure, to a more objective analysis relating to whether any PHI was actually acquired or viewed as a result of the breach. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and health information. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than or differ from HIPAA, our communities must comply with both the applicable federal and state standards. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in 2019 alone. Finally, the Office for Civil Rights and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, including the emerging threat of ransomware and similar cyber-attacks. The increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats presents challenges to the entire healthcare industry.
Our communities must also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that such communities are “public accommodations” as defined in those laws. The obligation to comply with the ADA and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and we continue to assess our communities and make appropriate modifications. 
Insurance
Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, our employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, generally continue to increase. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, among other things, we have:

• | become fully self-insured for all health-related claims of covered employees;


• | increased the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance;


• | operated an offshore captive insurance company which participates in our workers’ compensation, professional and general liability and certain of our automobile liability insurance programs, which may allow us to reduce our net insurance costs by retaining the earnings on our reserves, provided our claims experience does not exceed that projected by various statutory and actuarial formulas;


• | increased the amounts that some of our employees are required to pay for health insurance coverage and copayments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreasing the amount of certain healthcare benefits as well as adding a high deductible health insurance plan as an option for our employees;


• | for our managed senior living communities, our residents either buy insurance directly and are required to list us as an insured party, or we purchase the insurance ourselves and are reimbursed;


• | utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our workers’ compensation and professional and general liabilities, including programs to prevent liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries; and


• | utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and captive insurance programs.

We partially self-insure up to certain limits for workers’ compensation, professional and general liability, automobile and property coverage. Claims that exceed these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self-insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable annually. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self-insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher deductibles, retention amounts, self-insurance or other means in the future. 
Environmental and Climate Change Matters

Ownership of real estate is subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages we incur in connection with hazardous substances. In addition, these laws also impose various requirements regarding the operation and maintenance of properties, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to environmental matters that may require us to incur costs to comply.
Under our previously existing leases with DHC, we agreed to indemnify DHC for any environmental liabilities it may
incur related to the senior living communities subject to those leases and the properties on which they are located. We reviewed environmental surveys of certain of our owned and previously leased, but now managed, properties prior to their purchase or the commencement of our leasing of those communities. Based upon environmental surveys we obtained and reviewed for certain of our senior living communities, as well as the results of operations at our senior living communities, we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of the senior living communities we currently operate that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot be sure that environmental conditions are not present at our owned or previously leased properties, that potential costs we incur in the future related to any such conditions will be funded by DHC if they relate to a senior living community we manage for DHC, or that such potential costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or results of operations.
When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather or climate-related event, and suffer potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.
Concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our communities to increase. In the long-term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in the form of higher charges for our services. However, in the short-term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change and other environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to environmental risks,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to climate change and adverse weather risks” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Climate Change".

We are aware of the impact of our communities on the environment. When we renovate our senior living communities, we generally use energy-efficient products, including lighting, windows and heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
