Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of comprehensive technology solutions that transform the healthcare experience by engaging patients in their care and enabling healthcare provider organizations to optimize operational efficiency, improve profitability and enhance clinical care and safety. Through the SaaS-based technology platform, which we refer to as the Phreesia Platform or our Platform, we offer healthcare provider client organizations, or provider clients, a robust suite of solutions to manage the patient intake process and an integrated payments solution for secure processing of patient payments. Our Platform also provides life sciences companies with an engagement channel for targeted and direct communication with patients. In fiscal 2021, we facilitated patient visits in over 1,800 healthcare provider clients across all 50 states. We define a patient visit as an individual, in-person or telehealth visit to a healthcare provider, which may include multiple visits by the same patient. Additionally, our Platform processed nearly $2.0 billion in patient payments in fiscal 2021.
Patient intake is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous tasks, including registration, insurance verification, patient questionnaires, patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, payments and scheduling. Inefficiencies during the intake process often result in lower patient and provider satisfaction, wasted time, missed revenue opportunities and diminished health outcomes. Phreesia was founded to revolutionize patient intake and to create a better, more engaging healthcare experience. We have created an integrated and streamlined system that automates data capture and engages patients before, during and after the point of care.
The Phreesia Platform manages the end-to-end patient intake process and encompasses a comprehensive range of services, including initial patient contact, registration, appointment scheduling, payments and post-appointment patient surveys. The Phreesia Platform securely collects and analyzes each patient’s information and provides engagement tools to efficiently guide each patient through their healthcare journey. We deploy our Platform across a range of modalities, including through patients’ mobile devices (Phreesia Mobile), through a web-based dashboard for providers (Phreesia Dashboard) and through our proprietary, self-service intake tablets (PhreesiaPads) and on-site kiosks (Arrivals Kiosks), all of which provide an individualized intake experience for each patient based on age, gender and appointment type. Our solutions are highly customizable and scalable to any size healthcare provider organization and can seamlessly integrate within a provider client’s workflows and leading Practice Management, or PM, and Electronic Health Record, or EHR, systems. Our Platform additionally allows for time-of-service and secure post-explanation of benefits integrated payments.
We serve an array of provider clients ranging from single-specialty practices, which include internal and family medicine, urology, dermatology, and orthopedics, to large multi-specialty groups and health systems. Our life sciences revenue is generated from clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries, including 13 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies as measured by revenue in fiscal 2021.
Our Platform
The Phreesia Platform currently offers the following solutions to our clients:
•Our registration solution automates patient self-registration via Phreesia Mobile—either before or at the time of the patient’s visit—or through the use of a purpose-built PhreesiaPad or Arrivals Kiosk for on-site check-in. The solution also includes the Phreesia Dashboard, which provider staff use to monitor and manage the intake process.
•Our revenue cycle solution provides insurance-verification processes, point-of-sale payments applications and cost estimation presentment tools, which help providers maximize the timely collection of patient payments.
•Our appointments solution provides a comprehensive appointment scheduling system to provide clients with applications for online appointments, reminders and referral tracking and management.
•Our patient activation solution enables providers to communicate with their patients through automated, tailored surveys, announcements, text and email messaging and targeted health campaigns.
•Our clinical support solution collects clinical intake and PRO data for more than 25 specialties, enabling our clients to ask the right clinical questions of the right patients at the right time, and gather key data that aligns with their quality-reporting goals.
•Our COVID-19 product offerings give our provider organization clients the tools they need to stay open, keep patients and staff safe, and navigate a shifting landscape. We offer solutions for managing COVID-19 vaccine

delivery and identifying vaccine-hesitant patients, screening for self-reported COVID-19 risk factors, enabling contactless check-in during in-person visits, and collecting intake information during telehealth visits.
•Our life sciences solution provides a channel for our life sciences clients to deliver targeted and clinically relevant marketing content to patients, which allows them to have more informed conversations with their providers. We also enable our life sciences clients to receive direct patient feedback to incorporate into their business models.
The Phreesia Platform provides significant and measurable value to patients, healthcare provider organizations and life sciences companies. For patients, we provide a safe, seamless, individualized intake experience and flexible payment options. For provider clients, we enable them to increase collections, streamline the referral process, improve quality measures, increase patient satisfaction and consistently collect key clinical, demographic and social data. Based on client feedback and our internal analysis, we believe that the majority of our provider clients have been able to increase time-of-service collections after installing our Platform. For life sciences clients, we increase patient awareness and education of their marketed products. Based on ongoing analyses of client advertising campaigns conducted by data analytics companies, we believe patients exposed to a brand campaign using the Phreesia Platform are more likely, on average, to take an action, such as having a prescription filled for that product, than control patients.
The Phreesia Platform has evolved to provide a comprehensive range of technology applications and modules that address the growing needs of the healthcare market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. The success and continued evolution of our company has been due in large part to the talent and engagement of the entire Phreesia team. 
Industry challenges and our opportunity
We develop and market technology solutions that increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve clinical effectiveness in the healthcare industry. We believe the following trends impacting the healthcare industry represent significant opportunities for us.
Inefficiency and waste amidst continually rising U.S. healthcare costs
Excess healthcare spending is largely related to administrative inefficiencies, including complex billing procedures, non-standardized practices and a lack of communication between front- and back-office operations, leading to increased costs, errors and inefficient use of providers’ time. Physician practices, burdened by these complex administrative and billing tasks, require extensive support staff to handle these challenges.
The patient intake process today is primarily manual, tedious, prone to costly errors and repetitive. By contrast, the Phreesia Platform provides an automated and comprehensive solution to address key provider pain points. As the leading patient intake platform, Phreesia increases staff and doctor efficiency and allows providers to maximize clinical time with patients, reduce administrative complexities and optimize the delivery of care.
Increasing patient financial responsibility in healthcare
As healthcare expenditures continue to rise, employers and health systems have shifted more of the cost to patients through increased cost sharing and the use of high-deductible health plans. The emergence of the patient as a major payer of healthcare is a dramatic shift in the industry payment landscape, which requires provider staff to obtain payment from the patient before and after the point of care. These tasks are best accomplished with more automated registration, billing and collection workflows, as well as patient-centric payment options. Against this backdrop, patients have historically struggled to understand their bills. 
Phreesia’s comprehensive digital payments platform enables providers to more effectively engage patients and increase collections. Our robust suite of revenue cycle solutions drives profitability, increases transparency and enhances the patient financial experience.
Expanding consumerism in healthcare
As patients pay an ever-growing share of their healthcare costs, they are increasingly demanding higher quality care, increased cost transparency, shared decision making and convenience. As such, patient experience and satisfaction are becoming important priorities for providers as they compete to attract and retain new patients. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly becoming more patient-centric due to increased competition and development of more targeted therapies.
We believe the Phreesia Platform drives improved patient satisfaction and education, efficiency and overall quality of care. Our Platform provides an end-to-end patient intake solution that allows patients to engage on multiple 
Table of Contents

devices (Phreesia Mobile, PhreesiaPad or Arrivals Kiosk) to provide streamlined, self-service patient intake and empowers providers with intuitive, cloud-based software that drives actionable insights. Our automated and integrated intake solution allows us to achieve high levels of patient utilization, providing us and our provider clients with important access to patients at key moments of their care. We also help educate patients about relevant treatment options to encourage more engaging provider interaction, and we provide pharmaceutical companies with an effective channel to incorporate the patient voice in to their business models in an increasingly competitive, patient-centric healthcare environment.
Ongoing shift to value-based reimbursement models
The United States healthcare system has been shifting toward alternative payment models, including value-based care. Under these models, provider organizations share financial risk and are reimbursed based on patients’ experience and outcomes. According to the American Hospital Association, the shift to value-based contracting models requires healthcare provider organizations to manage new challenges related to measurement and reporting, population health management, care coordination and other patient demands, all of which may require additional staff and capabilities.
The Phreesia Platform provides real-time insights necessary to improve outcomes in a value-based operating model. We utilize industry-accepted PROs and clinical screening tools that have been developed by third parties and tested for reliability, sensitivity and validity. These PROs allow our healthcare provider clients to close gaps in care, identify successful treatments and engage patients in their care. At the same time, our ability to streamline the intake process and critical workflows improves provider and staff efficiency, allowing for optimal allocation of resources to manage the demands of a value-based care model.
Increasing focus on personalized healthcare solutions
We believe that the treatment and prevention of disease are becoming increasingly personalized. The emphasis on patient-centered solutions is driven by technological advancements in the use of patient-specific health, lifestyle/environmental, genomic and other data to diagnose, treat and prevent disease at a personalized level. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, pharmaceutical companies currently spend a substantial portion of their direct-to-consumer marketing dollars on television and print to reach large patient populations with chronic conditions such as diabetes and pain, which we believe is not as effective as targeted outreach. As new therapies, including those for smaller patient populations, are brought to market, pharmaceutical companies need cost-efficient marketing channels and capabilities to promote new medicines.
Phreesia’s high levels of patient engagement and robust targeting capabilities create an attractive marketing channel for life sciences companies to reach and inform targeted patient populations while patients are seeking care which empowers patients to have informed conversations with their physician about their care plan and treatment options.
Our market opportunity
The Phreesia Platform serves a range of provider clients, including single-specialty practices, large multi-specialty groups and health systems. Through our life sciences solutions, we provide services to large and small pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. We believe the current addressable market for our Platform and services is approximately $9.0 billion and is derived from: (1) the potential subscription-based revenue generated from the approximately 1.3 million U.S.-based providers who take medical appointments in ambulatory care settings and who work in hospital settings, (2) consumer-related transaction and payment processing fees, which are based on a percentage of payments that can be processed via the Phreesia Platform and addresses approximately $91.0 billion of annual out of pocket patient spend in ambulatory healthcare related professional services, and (3) a portion of the $6.0 billion spent by life sciences companies on direct-to-consumer prescription drug marketing. We estimate that our target client universe in the ambulatory and hospital markets is approximately 50,000 unique provider clients. As we develop new products and services on the Phreesia Platform, we expect our total addressable market to grow.

•Improved patient experience. Our Platform streamlines the patient intake process and provides consumer-centric options for check-in. We pre-populate information from prior visits, minimizing the frustration of repetitive questions during the intake process and streamlining the information for review by a clinician by the time the patient reaches the exam room. We also offer patients a convenient, flexible, secure intake experience that saves time and reduces the confusion and anxiety around payments. Additionally, our cost estimation presentment tools allow patients to receive an accurate estimate of their out-of-pocket spend for a particular service prior to receiving care. Patients are also able to save time by making their appointments using our technology.
•Flexible payment options. Our Platform provides patients with flexibility and choice in how they pay for healthcare services. Patients are able to pay upfront or set up an automated payment plan that adheres to our provider clients' financial policies. Patients can also choose to pay online on their provider’s website or place a card on file. Our Platform also removes the need for difficult payment-related conversations with staff and ensures a level of personal privacy throughout the transaction.
•Engagement in care. By leveraging the power of self-service and providing individualized, flexible intake solutions, we engage patients early in their healthcare journey and empower them to be more active in their care decisions. We also provide relevant information to patients’ care at the time of service to further educate them so they can take an active role in their healthcare decisions.
Value proposition for healthcare provider organizations
•Simplify operations and enhance staff efficiency. We enable healthcare provider organizations to streamline operations through automated patient intake and payments that are integrated into existing workflows and PM and EHR systems. By automating the numerous tasks of the intake process, our provider clients have been able to save time on patient check-ins.

  Our competitive landscape
We compete in a dynamic patient intake market with direct and indirect competitors that maintain varying degrees of resources and capabilities. We believe many direct competitors are focused on the basic aspects of electronic patient intake and are only starting to expand into the multiple adjacencies beyond patient registration. Some of our existing and potential partners, particularly EHR providers, have developed their own patient intake solutions and have become direct competitors. The Phreesia Platform is integrated with a majority of the leading EHR systems, and we have put in place partnerships designed for shared financial success. KLAS, an independent healthcare information technology research firm, evaluates Phreesia against many of these direct competitors and named Phreesia the top-ranked patient intake management vendor for 2019, 2020 and 2021, based on direct feedback from healthcare organizations across the country.
We believe companies in the patient intake market compete on the basis of several factors, including: 
•price;
•breadth, depth, quality and reliability of product and service offerings;
•ease of use;
•ability to drive tangible return on investment;
•client-focused implementation services and training programs;
•healthcare domain expertise; 
•patient clinical content offerings;
•client support and client services; and 
•ability to integrate with all of a client’s existing systems, including EHR and/or PM systems.
Life sciences marketing is highly competitive and rapidly evolving and consists of both traditional media platforms (e.g. television and print media) as well as more modern web-based and application-based platforms that provide direct-to-consumer marketing for the life sciences industries. Our targeted marketing solutions are unique and compete at the point of care as well as pre- and post-visit across an array of digital devices backed by our commitment to transparency and third-party auditing. We compete on the basis of several factors, including price, quality, transparency and the ability to demonstrate meaningful return on investment. 
Our competitive strengths
Market leadership. We believe the Phreesia Platform is the most comprehensive and scalable patient intake and payments solution in the market, placing us at the point of care and in the center of the patient-provider relationship. Phreesia is an industry leader in market share and user engagement, serving over 1,800 healthcare provider client organizations during fiscal 2021.
Scalable SaaS-based platform embedded in mission-critical daily workflows. Our Platform seamlessly integrates into our provider clients’ daily workflows with bi-directional integration into PM and EHR systems collectively representing the majority of the total PM and EHR market. These robust integrations provide real-time exchange of clinical, demographic and financial information. For example, customized consent forms and questionnaires are uploaded directly into a provider client’s PM or EHR system immediately upon completion, which reduces staff time spent on administrative tasks. Our feature-rich SaaS technology architecture is highly scalable across healthcare provider organizations of all sizes, from small independent practices to large health systems with multiple locations, enabling us to implement our solutions quickly and cost-effectively.
Integrated payment platform. The integration of payments within our patient intake platform creates a seamless experience for both patients and providers and results in increased payments for healthcare provider organizations and revenue for Phreesia. Compared with disparate payment platforms and manual reconciliation processes, the Phreesia Platform automatically posts payments in real-time to a provider client’s PM system, creating material time and cost efficiencies for our provider clients. Our revenue cycle solutions, such as card on file and online payments and payment plans, provide convenient payment options for patients, lower bad debt expense for provider clients and reduce payment-related tasks for their staff.
Significant and measurable return on investment. We actively measure and report performance metrics for our provider clients, demonstrating significant and sustainable return on investment in multiple impact areas, often as

early as 30-60 days after launch. Example impact areas include: increased collections, expanding staff and provider capacity, optimizing profitability by reducing back-office billing and collection costs, improving patient experience through streamlined scheduling and check-in process and flexible payment options, and enhancing clinical care by creating time savings for staff and clinicians.
Proven ability to innovate and meet the evolving needs of our clients. We have demonstrated the ability to quickly and reliably incorporate new applications into the Phreesia Platform to address the myriad of challenges facing healthcare provider organizations and we continue to evaluate the most impactful innovations that will drive a better healthcare experience. Our solution was initially designed as a patient check-in and messaging tool, but it has rapidly evolved into a comprehensive patient intake and payment platform designed to keep pace with evolving demand from patients and providers. We have introduced multiple new applications in the last three years, including Phreesia Mobile, which allows patients to check in conveniently from their own device and has significantly increased patient utilization and overall patient engagement, and Payment Assurance, which eliminates many of the manual tasks required to bill a patient. Additionally, Phreesia has been committed to supporting our provider organization clients as they respond to coronavirus, or COVID-19, by helping them stay safe, stay open and continue to see and vaccinate patients. To that end, we have released a number of new product offerings and features to align with our clients’ evolving needs and workflows, including tools for screening and managing patient vaccinations, supporting drive-through appointments and other no-waiting-room models, communicating with patients and promoting them to schedule appointments, collecting patient information during telehealth visits and reducing patient-staff contact during in-person visits. 
Attractive, highly scalable financial model. Our revenue is largely derived from recurring monthly subscriptions and re-occurring payment processing fees, which should increase with growth of our client base and the ongoing shift of healthcare costs to patients. We have successfully expanded our products sold to existing clients by adding incremental providers and offering additional solutions to these clients. This has led to a 6% increase in average revenue per provider client from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. As our provider clients continue to add more providers to our Platform, we benefit from increased scale and strong unit economics.
Founder-led and deeply experienced management team with strong culture. Our founders, Chaim Indig and Evan Roberts, are pioneers in patient intake who have led our company through consistent and rapid growth over more than 15 years. Our senior leadership team has extensive healthcare, technology and payment knowledge and expertise, and an average 10-year tenure with Phreesia. Additionally, our dedicated sales, implementation, support and development teams also have significant healthcare, technology and payment experience and are a key competitive advantage to our success in the marketplace.
Attracting and retaining top talent is a high priority for us. Our strong, diverse company culture and investment in the long-term career growth for our people is evidenced by their long tenure with our organization. We believe our success is due in large part to the continued engagement of our talented and committed team.
Our growth strategies
The success of our business depends on acquiring new provider clients and increasing utilization among our existing provider clients, which in turn drives growth across our Platform and solutions. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from a number of prevailing industry tailwinds across patient intake, patient payments and life sciences marketing. We intend to continue to proactively grow the business through the following strategies:
Expanding our Platform to new healthcare provider organizations
The market for a technology-powered intake and payment platform in the U.S. healthcare industry is early, large and underserved, and we believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our client base and market share. With the ability to support over 25 different medical specialties and existing partnerships with leading PM and EHR providers, the Phreesia Platform is able to serve a large portion of the U.S. ambulatory and acute care market. The Phreesia Platform is currently used by a small percentage of ambulatory and acute care organizations, and we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force to win new clients.
Deepening our relationship with existing provider clients
We generate recurring fees from our provider clients based on the number of providers who utilize the Phreesia Platform plus subscriptions for any add-on applications. As our provider clients realize the value of the Phreesia Platform, they typically purchase additional subscriptions for their providers. Our sales strategy is focused on expanding our revenue per provider client and we believe there is a significant opportunity to sell new applications as well as add additional provider clients.

Healthcare laws and regulations
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Moreover, in many jurisdictions in which we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. In addition, our consumer transactions business is subject to certain financial services laws, regulations and rules, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. 
U.S. state and federal health information privacy and security laws 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, including health information. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, referred to as PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our provider customers are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. As a service provider who creates, receives, maintains or transmits PHI on behalf of our covered entity customers, Phreesia is a “business associate” as defined under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, certain HIPAA requirements are also directly applicable to business associates. 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, business associates must notify covered entities of a breach, and those covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. In the event of a breach, our covered entity customers may require we provide assistance in the breach notification process and may seek indemnification and other contractual remedies. 
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct 
Table of Contents

periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. 
Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. California recently enacted and has proposed companion regulations to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA has been in effect since January 1, 2020, and the California State Attorney General began enforcement on July 1, 2020. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). While any information we maintain in our role as a business associate may be exempt from the CCPA, other records and information we maintain on our customers may be subject to the CCPA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with these additional state laws. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some state laws, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. 
In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws. Such laws, for example, could include state laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. 
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts with our business associates, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others. 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) 
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, is a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls and faxes. Since its inception, the TCPA’s purview has extended to text messages sent to consumers. Our services that leverage text messaging are subject to the TCPA and its regulations and agency guidance. 
U.S. corporate practice of medicine; fee splitting 
Approximately 30 states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as Phreesia, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws, which vary among the states that have enacted them, are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. We frequently enter into services contracts with healthcare provider organizations pursuant to which we provide them with revenue cycle management, insurance enrollment verification, patient intake, scheduling, appointment reminders and a range of other services. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons. These laws are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, the 
Table of Contents

provision of medical equipment and the hiring and management of clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. 
Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our agreements with providers licensed in the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with our provider clients constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to, among other things, adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our provider clients, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our provider clients that interfere with our business and other materially adverse consequences. 
U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws 
Federal Stark Law 
We may be subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties for each violation and twice the dollar value of each such service and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider implicitly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing, ordering, arranging, or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines and penalties up to three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Imposition of any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. On December 2, 2020, the OIG published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in the Federal Register. Under the final rule, the OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. On the same day, CMS published a final rule that provides a safe harbor for value-based compensation agreements under the Stark Law. However, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, or GAO, found that these final rules did not meet the sixty-day delay required under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA. Additionally, on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration issued a moratorium on all Trump-era rules that have not yet taken effect. Due to the CRA delay and the Biden administration moratorium, it is not clear when these safe harbors and exceptions will be effective. We continue to monitor the impact this change may have on our business.

False Claims Act 
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers and their service providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims provisions. 
State fraud and abuse laws 
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Other healthcare laws 
HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payers of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payers as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs. 
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Further, in October 2020, OIG released an opinion indicating it also does not favor patient assistance programs. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles, as well as patient assistance programs, offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. 
Healthcare reform in 2020
On March 9, 2020, the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONC, and CMS promulgated final rules aimed at supporting seamless and secure access, exchange, and use of electronic health information, or EHI, by increasing innovation and competition by giving patients and their healthcare providers 
Table of Contents

secure access to health information and new tools, allowing for more choice in care and treatment. The final rules are intended to clarify and operationalize provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, regarding interoperability and “information blocking,” and create significant new requirements for health care industry participants. Information blocking is defined as any activity that is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI, where a health information technology developer, health information network or health information exchange knows or should know that such practice is likely to interfere with access to, exchange or use of EHI. The new rules create significant new requirements for health care industry participants, and require certain electronic health record technology to incorporate standardized application programming interfaces, or APIs, to allow individuals to securely and easily access structured EHI using smartphone applications. The ONC will also implement provisions of the Cures Act requiring that patients can electronically access all of their EHI (structured and/or unstructured) at no cost. Finally, to further support access and exchange of EHI, the final ONC rule implements the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act and identifies eight “reasonable and necessary activities” as exceptions to information blocking activities, as long as specific conditions are met. Pursuant to the final rule, health IT developers will be subject to requirements such as prohibitions on participating in any action that constitutes information blocking, providing certification to the Secretary of HHS that they will not take actions that constitute information blocking, and other related requirements. On October 29, 2020, HHS released an interim final rule delaying compliance dates for certain aspects of the final rule in light of pressures placed on the healthcare industry by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impact of these rules and any delays that may take place.
The final CMS rule focuses on patients in Medicare Advantage organizations, Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) fee-for-service programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and qualified health plan issuers on the federally-facilitated exchanges and enacts measures to enable patients to have both their clinical and administrative information travel with them. By January 1, 2021, payers must make patient data dating back to January 1, 2016 available through an API. As a result of COVID-19 and to provide additional flexibility to payors, CMS will exercise enforcement discretion for a period of six months in connection with the Patient Access API and Provider Directory API provisions of the final CMS rule and therefore will not enforce these new requirements until July 1, 2021.
Intellectual property
Our continued growth and success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including the Phreesia Platform. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade secrets and other contractual rights, including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. 
However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive SaaS platform or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, we had 827 full-time employees, including 320 in services and support, 254 in sales and marketing, 157 in research and development and 96 in general and administrative. As of January 31, 2021, we had 523 full-time employees in the United States and 304 full-time employees internationally. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Talent and Culture: The success and continued evolution of our company has been due in large part to the talent and engagement of the entire Phreesia team. Our team members are key pillars of our success and fostering and developing their talent is central to our culture. Attracting and retaining top talent is a high priority for us, and we look to hire smart, passionate, diverse and driven individuals who want to be a part of our mission. Our strong company culture and investment in long-term career growth for our people is evidenced by their long tenure with our organization. We believe our success is due in large part to the continued engagement of our talented and committed team. Modern Healthcare magazine recognized Phreesia as one of the “Best Places to Work in Healthcare” for four of the past five years, optimally positioning us to continue to attract top healthcare and technology talent.

Diversity and Inclusiveness: We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) support our commitment to promoting and maintaining an inclusive culture for all employees by bringing together individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. These groups seek to foster a sense of shared community and empowerment for employees who share a common social identity, such as gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Phreesians can voluntarily join an ERG to network, discuss and exchange ideas and enhance their professional development. 
We recognize that our ability to execute on our mission of creating a better, more engaging experience depends on our people. We are committed to supporting gender equality in our organization, including through our inclusive culture, board representation, pathways to leadership for women, pay equity and strong family-leave policies. 
We published our first Phreesia Gender Equality Report in 2020 based on the framework provided by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index to which Phreesia was added in January 2021. 
COVID-19 Response and Remote Workforce: During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, including movement to a fully remote work environment. During the past year, we have made the decision to become a fully remote company, as we believe this arrangement allows us access to the best talent and creates optimal flexibility for our employees.
