ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Startek, Inc. (“Startek”, the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a global business process management company for some of the world’s most iconic brands, who operate in a variety of  markets. Operating under the Startek and Aegis brand, we help enterprises connect emotionally with their end customers, transform customer experience and accelerate digital and AI enablement across all their touch points and channels. We do this through customer experience (“CX”) and analytics services, technology-led innovation, and engagement solutions and a complete range of services around the customer life cycle management process (CLM). Our solutions are supported by over 42,000 employees, delivering services from 46 locations in 13 countries on five continents. Each day, our customer experience experts work together to deliver customer experiences that are personal, meaningful, and true to our clients’ brands.
 
The Company was founded in 1987, centered on supply chain management services, including packaging, fulfillment, marketing support and logistics services. After our initial public offering on June 19, 1997, we increasingly focused on operating customer care contact centers and grew to include our current suite of customer experience offerings. To help us remain strategically competitive while expanding our reach with new and existing clients, we acquired several companies from 2013 to 2015. On July 20, 2018, the Company acquired CSP Alpha Midco Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (“Aegis”), which resulted in CSP Alpha Holdings Parent Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (“Capital Square Partners or CSP”) owning a majority of the Company's outstanding shares. Capital Square Partners, a Singapore based private equity fund, which owned Aegis, is now the majority shareholder in the Company, owning approximately 55% of our outstanding shares. The combination greatly improved our competitive position in the market by providing us with access to many of the world’s most rapidly growing markets, offer services in many languages, offer a strong footprint, and a foundation of operational excellence capabilities and industry best practices.
 
We offer customer engagement experience in almost every industry, and tailored expertise in the telecommunications, e-commerce & consumer, financial & business services, media & cable, travel & hospitality, technology,  education & healthcare, energy and utilities sectors. We serve over 220 clients globally, many of whom are industry leaders in their respective verticals and geographies. We understand the industries in which our clients operate and the unique challenges they face, and we also understand the culture of the business or geography within which our services are delivered. We believe our knowledge of best practices across different industries coupled with an understanding of the solutions that can be implemented in the context of our clients’ operating environments, enables us to improve processes and performance metrics—driving measurable results that differentiate our clients from their competitors. The trust and confidence that our clients have in us is underscored by the long relationships we enjoy with many of our key clients; we have worked with our top five clients for more than nine years on average. We hold the distinction of being a global company with a local flair, one that allows our customers derive efficiencies in service delivery from onshore, nearshore and off-shore locations. This multi-share capability allows us to craft customized experiences across cultures and continents.

Service Offerings
 
Startek offers a broad range of customer experience, technology and back-office support solutions that are designed to help our clients gain competitive advantage by transforming their customer experience operations. Our solutions align our clients’ unique requirements by being highly configurable, insight driven, technology-led, and vertical specific.
Customer Engagement: 
 
To stay ahead and stand apart, our clients' businesses need to sell not just a product or service, but a promise. One that is fulfilled by delivering consistent, creative customer-brand engagements with an emotional connect. And we deliver that connect through omni-channel uniformity enabled by our tech-enabled and empowered workforce. In the age of the digital consumer, we support them throughout the entire customer lifecycle by helping them pique interest, elevate experience, nurture leads, make sales, reduce churn and grow customer brand affinity with our CX driven digital engagement services and solutions.
Omnichannel Engagement:

Today, customers expect to connect immediately, have quick resolutions, and use digital self-service technologies without any compromise on experience. We help create seamless omnichannel functions and synchronise interactions between a brand and a customer – across multiple channels. When clients want to cultivate and integrate engagement channels, we offer cloud-enabled omnichannel solutions to optimize all opportunities. We also enable them to integrate diverse self-service technologies that are adaptive and agile in order to make the most of the cultivated leads that their brand spends money and time nurturing.
Social Media:
 
Social media is pervasive in nature and harnessing its energy for business relevance is mandatory. We design and power human intelligent social media support, technologies, and approaches, across multiple channels, and our transformation experts ensure that our clients' social campaigns and communities are performance-driven, brand aligned and nurture loyalty. Our approaches are underpinned by a combination of third-party tools and AegisLISA—our proprietary platform that tracks and monitors social conversation threads across numerous niche digital streams and helps clients derive actionable intelligence and opportunities. We work with brands from inception to maturity, as trusted partners, helping our clients realize true value, experiences and business outcomes that meet their needs and exceed customer expectations.
Customer Intelligence Analytics:
 
A digitally driven, customer-centric and data-filled world requires intelligent decision-making. That means leveraging data, next-gen technologies, and capabilities. We consider analytics to be an essential arm of our digital offerings because our clients' businesses are only as competent as the insights that fuel it. We offer cutting edge data environments, cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence driven technologies and data scientists who deliver insights. We use analytics to shape relationships, scale businesses, predict behaviours, segment customers and augment customer experiences. This translates consumer insights and big data into initiatives that drive transformation and above-market growth.
Work from Home:
 
Volatile market conditions, shortage of talent and unprecedented challenges have mandated the Work From Home (WFH) option. Ours is a model that is unique because it is highly secured, highly compliant, and highly flexible. We have a cloud enabled virtual desktop for our engagement specialists with a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) approach. A virtual command center, consisting of functional and business leaders is ever-activated to enable real-time monitoring of business continuity across geographies. Data Security is one of our strongest assets and to that end we have Artificial Intelligence enabled applications that are designed to activate alerts, conduct monitoring, offer facial detection systems, watermark and mask secure content and more – all to make our clients' businesses more resilient and agile. We retain client confidence with our proven, secure, and compliant WFH technologies that helps them deepen their connection with their customers through digital contactless customer communication.
Startek Cloud
 
In a rapidly changing world, cloud empowers novel and flexible operating models. As part of our geo-strategy, accelerated by global shifts, we have moved to the Campus on Cloud framework. Startek Cloud is our next-generation hybrid omni-cloud platform, integrated with AI capabilities, which leverages remote and home-based specialists, and telework for increased business agility and continuity. With a foundation based on 4 pillars - virtual desktop cloud, web enabled contact centre, workforce management and e-learning - it is a system that serves every real-time requirement, on-demand.
Back Office Services
 
To help clients enhance their customer-centric view of relationships while maximizing operating efficiencies, we provide finance and accounting services, human resource processing services, data management, and spend management services. These back-office services are designed to help our clients achieve their business objectives by automating repetitive processes and aligning human capital with business goals.

Our Clients
 
We develop long-term relationships with global corporations and medium-sized enterprises whose business complexities and customer focus require a strategic partner who can quickly and globally scale the tools, technology, and talent needed to design and deliver the desired customer experience. We provide these services to clients from our delivery campuses across North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had a diverse client base of more than 220 clients across a variety of verticals, including companies that we believe are among the leading players in their respective industries. Approximately 34% of our revenue is derived from clients within the telecommunications industry which has resulted in a rapidly evolving environment for service providers. Our focus is on the continued diversification of the industries we serve by targeting high growth verticals such as e-commerce and consumer, financial and business services, healthcare and education and travel and hospitality. Our revenues for year ended December 31, 2020 by industries served were as follows:
 

 | Year ended December 31, 2020
----------------------------------+-----------------------------
Telecom | 34% 
E-commerce & Consumer | 16% 
Media & Cable | 15% 
Healthcare & Education | 10% 
Travel & Hospitality | 9% 
Financial & Business Services | 8% 
Technology, IT & Related Services | 3% 
Others | 5% 

 
In the year ending December 2020, our top five and ten clients represented 39% and 50% of total revenue, respectively.  Master Service Agreements (MSAs) cover all our work for each client; these MSAs are typically multi-year contracts that may or may not include auto-renewal provisions. Although they typically do not include contractual minimum volumes and are generally terminable by the client without penalty upon prior written notice, our relationships with our top five clients have averaged around nine years, including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients.
 
Our clients’ customer experience needs, continue to evolve and expand beyond basic order processing or first-tier calls to handling complex issues that require advanced problem-solving skills, an in-depth understanding of their customers, sourcing the relevant technology capabilities to deliver personalized customer experience, and building a highly-qualified talent pool for managing the customer experience. Digital outsourcing drivers for enterprises such as access to better technology, analytics, and omnichannel solutions are increasingly becoming more important than traditional outsourcing drivers. Our clients are looking to us to provide them with next generation technology solutions to help them solve key business problems. We are committed to delivering solutions through which we partner with our clients to achieve and deliver the desired customer experience. We are investing in digital solutions and automation technologies that will unlock customer insights using state of the art digital technologies.
 

Key Competitive Differentiators
 
Our client base is largely comprised of leading global and regional brands. We believe our international footprint, world-class technology, and human capital solutions powered by our Startek cloud based solutions are ideally suited for these clients. These brands increasingly look to partner with service providers who embrace customer-centricity and proactively suggest innovative solutions to transform their customer experience operations. We believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this changing landscape and are differentiated by our insights and analytics, technology-led innovation, and customizable engagement solutions. Additionally, we also believe our innovative human capital strategies and operational best practices are key competitive advantages. The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies depends on our competitive strengths, which are briefly described below:

Human Capital
 
We have more than three decades of experience managing global talent and offer a consistent, scalable, and flexible workforce that is passionate about delivering the desired customer experience while meeting or exceeding our clients’ key business objectives. We consistently invest in forward-thinking strategies to attract, develop, reward, and retain top talent across our global enterprise.

As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 42,000 employees in 13 countries on five continents. Approximately 93% of our employees are located outside the United States. Approximately 8% of our employees were members of a labor union or were covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of which are mandated under national labor laws outside the United States. These agreements are subject to periodic renegotiations, and we anticipate that they will be renewed in the ordinary course of business without material impact to our business or in a manner materially different from other companies covered by such industry-wide agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Driving a superior customer experience for our clients is at the center of everything we do. Our customer experience experts are on the front lines every day working to build and maintain strong customer relationships that drive sales, satisfaction, and loyalty for our clients’ brands. To help us accelerate revenue growth across the globe, we will continue to invest in our core customer experience solutions, including strengthening our consulting and analytics capabilities, technology-enabled platforms, and embedding findings from research in human communication science.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal depending on our clients' marketing programs and product launches. These are often geared toward the end of summer and the winter holiday buying season in the United States, and during major local festival seasons across our other geographies.
Industry
 
The worldwide customer management business process outsourcing ("CM BPO") market is projected to grow steadily at slightly above 4% compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") through 2023, according to industry research firms. By the end of 2023, it is estimated that the CM BPO industry will achieve a total market size of around $240 billion. Approximately 52% of worldwide BPO spend comes from the Americas region, while Asia-Pacific region has the strongest growth (around 5% CAGR). Evolving buyer expectations to deliver next-generation CX will continue to fuel growth as brands increasingly turn to service providers to support their ongoing efforts for digital transformation.
 
The industry is also evolving to include key strategic elements beyond traditional contact centers and now includes CX consulting and digital CX services. Despite ongoing market consolidation through multiple mergers and acquisitions, this expanded scope of services driven by the digital CX needs of enterprises is likely to increase the market attractiveness for not only incumbent players but also for new providers with differentiated digital CX capabilities, according to industry research firm Everest Group.
 
Competition
 
The global contact center outsourcing market in which we operate is competitive. While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no single company is dominant in the industry. The industry itself continues to consolidate but remains very fragmented with the five largest competitors combined capturing less than 20% of the global market.
 
Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large, multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly-focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, and financial strength. We primarily compete with in-house customer management operations and other companies that provide customer experience management, including Alorica, Concentrix, Sitel, Sykes, TTEC, Teleperformance, and Transcom, among others. We also compete with smaller, specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies such as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others.
 
Many of these competitors are significantly larger than us in revenue, income, number of contact centers and customer service agents, number of product offerings and market capitalization. We believe that while we are smaller than many of our competitors, we are able to compete because of our focus and scale and our ability to add value to our clients' businesses. Clients often select Startek to challenge these large competitors, because they want more innovation, flexibility and speed to market.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws in the countries, states, and territories in which we operate, including tax, employment, environmental and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including significant changes in domestic government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and taxation with respect to foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government programs, policies, regulatory requirements and labor laws; and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations.
