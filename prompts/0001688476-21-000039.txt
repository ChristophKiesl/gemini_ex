Item 1. Business
General description of the business
NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. is a predominately U.S. land focused oilfield service company, with a diverse set of well completion and production services across a variety of active and demanding basins. We provide our services through our operating subsidiaries to exploration and production (“E&P”) customers. Our integrated solutions approach is focused on delivering efficiency, and our ongoing commitment to innovation helps our customers capitalize on technological advancements. NexTier is differentiated through four points of distinction, including safety performance, efficiency, partnership and innovation. 
We were formed under the name Keane Group, Inc. as a Delaware corporation on October 13, 2016, to be a holding corporation as part of an organizational restructuring of Keane Group Holdings, LLC, which was formed March 1, 2011, and its subsidiaries, for the purpose of facilitating the initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in 2017. On January 25, 2017, we consummated an initial public offering (“IPO”). To effectuate the IPO, we completed a series of transactions reorganizing our business, resulting in the Company being a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of Keane Group. In connection with the restructuring, the Keane Group entities became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. 
In continuation of our growth through acquisition strategy, since 2013 has notably resulted in the growth of the location and scale of our operational footprint, expansion of our customer base, addition of wireline operations, increase in our pumping capacity and expansion of our hydraulic fracturing operations by more than an additional 1,040,000 hydraulic horsepower, on October 31, 2019, we completed a merger transaction with C&J Energy Services, Inc., a publicly traded Delaware corporation. Pursuant to this transaction, C&J was ultimately merged with and into one of our wholly owned merger subsidiary, with our subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity. On the effective date of the C&J Merger, we changed our name to “NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc.” 
In March of 2020, we divested the legal entities and the majority of the assets that comprised our Well Support Services segment. We are currently organized into two reportable segments, consisting of: 
•Completion Services, which consists of the following business lines: (1) fracturing services; (2) wireline and pumping services; and (3) completion support services, which includes our research and technology (“R&T”) department; and
•Well Construction and Intervention Services (“WC&I”), which consists of the following business lines: (1) cementing services and (2) coiled tubing services.
Completion Services segment
Our completion services are designed in partnership with our customers to enhance both initial production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from new and existing wells. The core services provided through our Completion Services segment are hydraulic fracturing, wireline and pumping services. We utilize our in-house capabilities, including our R&T department and data control instruments business, to offer a technologically advanced and efficiency focused range of completion techniques. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our fracturing business. 
Hydraulic Fracturing.    Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a highly viscous, pressurized fracturing fluid, typically a mixture of water, chemicals and proppant, into a well casing or tubing in order to fracture underground mineral formations. These fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and free a channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. Fracturing fluid mixtures include proppant that becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons upward through the well.
Wireline Technologies.    Our wireline services involve the use of a truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is unwound and lowered into oil and natural gas wells to convey specialized tools or equipment for well completion, well intervention, pipe recovery and reservoir evaluation purposes. We offer our wireline services in conjunction with our hydraulic fracturing services in “plug-and-perf” well completions to maximize efficiency for our customers. “Plug-and-perf” is a multi-stage well completion technique for cased-hole wells that consists of pumping a plug and perforating guns to a specified depth. Once the plug is set, the zone is perforated and the tools are removed from the well, a ball is pumped down to isolate the zones below the plug and the hydraulic fracturing treatment is applied. 
In addition, we offer wireline and pumping services that are not integrated with our fracturing services. We are one of the leading providers of perforating, pumpdown, pipe recovery, pressure pumping, and wellsite make-up and pressure testing services. We are highly experienced in safely servicing deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells in some of the most active onshore basins in the United States. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities through our R&T department allow us to manage costs and lead times with regard to hardware and perforating guns, switches and accessories, providing us with a competitive advantage and enabling higher returns.
In late 2020, we began evolving our completion service offerings to develop an integrated natural gas treatment and delivery solution. We believe this integration solution will assist our customers to reduce emissions at the wellsite and throughout their operations. This solution is focused on providing gas sourcing, compression, transport, decompression, treatment, and related services for our fracturing operations. We currently expect this additional integrated service to be available to our customers later in 2021.
Well Construction and Intervention Services segment
Cementing.    Our cementing services incorporate custom engineered mixing and blending equipment to ensure precision and accuracy in providing annulus isolation and hydraulic seal, while protecting fresh water zones from our customers’ zone of interest. Our cement division has the expertise to cement shallow to complex high temperature, high pressure wells. We also offer engineering software and technical guidance for remedial cementing applications and acidizing to optimize the performance of our customers’ wells. We are one of the largest providers of specialty cementing services in the United States. Our operations are supported by multiple full-service laboratory facilities with advanced capabilities.
Coiled Tubing.    We offer a broad range of coiled tubing services to help customers accomplish a wide variety of goals in their horizontal completion, workover and well maintenance projects. The majority of our coiled tubing fleet consists of large diameter coil, meaning two inches or larger in diameter, which allows us to service wells with longer lateral lengths. Our coiled tubing services allow customers to complete projects quickly and safely across a wide spectrum of pressures, without having to shut in their wells.
Well Support Services segment
On March 9, 2020 we sold our Well Support Services Segment. For additional information on this transaction, see Note (21) Business Segments of Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.” Prior to the sale, our Well Support Services segment focused on post-completion activities at the well site, and includes rig services, such as workover, fluids management, and other specialty well site services. The majority of revenue for this segment was generated by our rig services business, and we considered our rig services and fluids management businesses to be our primary service lines within this reportable segment.
Rig Services. As part of our services that helped prolong the productive life of an oil or gas well, we operated one of the largest rig fleets in the United States. These rigs were involved in the routine repair and maintenance of oil and gas wells, re-drilling operations and plug and abandonment operations. Workover services can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling horizontal or lateral wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously bypassed production zones, converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced recovery operations and conducting major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures. Workover services may last from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the workover. Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet were generally required throughout the life cycle of an oil or gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical repairs to the pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from wellbores, and pulling rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify and resolve production problems. Maintenance services were generally less complicated than completion and workover related services and required less time to perform. Our rig fleet was also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or gas wells that were at the end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally required auxiliary equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment services was not significantly impacted by the demand for oil and gas because well operators are required within a specified period of time by state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.
Fluids Management. We provided a full range of fluid services, including the storage, transportation and disposal of various fluids used in various phases including drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas wells. Our fleet of trucks and trailers and portable tanks enabled us to rapidly deploy our equipment across a broad geographic area. Included in our fleet of fluid trucks and trailers were specialized trucks and trailers that were optimized to transport condensate. We also owned private saltwater disposal wells. Demand and pricing for our fluids management services generally corresponded to demand for our rig services. 
Business strategy
As part of our integration under the NexTier name, introspection by the resulting management team refined our business mission as one to responsibly grow and continuously improve our business in a way that maximizes shareholder value by taking care of our people, our customers, our communities and the environment. Our principal business objective is to deliver integrated, environmentally conscious completion services and power solutions that help enable our customers to safely and affordably unlock sources of energy. We believe that by successfully deploying this strategy, we can deliver industry leading returns and increase shareholder value. We maintain a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. We expect to achieve this objective through:
•developing and expanding our relationships with existing and new customers;
•continuing our exemplary safety performance;
•investing further in driving efficiencies and environmental stewardship, including through our digital platform and evolving power solutions offering;
•maintaining a conservative balance sheet to preserve operational and strategic flexibility; and
•continuing to evaluate potential consolidation opportunities that strengthen our capabilities, increase our scale and create shareholder value.
For further discussion on the business strategies we plan to continue executing in 2021, see Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Customers
Our customers primarily include major integrated and large independent oil and natural gas E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had two customer who individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. These two customers collectively represented 29% of our consolidated revenue and 11% of our total accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had four customers who individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. These four customers collectively represented 55% of our consolidated revenue and 21% of our total accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers who individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. These three customers collectively represented 39% of our consolidated revenue and 45% of our total accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Competition and Sales
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive with significant potential for excess capacity. Projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to increase the highly competitive nature of the environment in which we operate. We provide services in various geographic regions, predominately across the U.S., and the competitive landscape varies in each. Utilization and pricing for our services have from time to time been negatively affected by increases in supply relative to demand in our operating areas and geographic markets. This was exacerbated in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other oil and gas market drivers. See additional discussion in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Our major competitors for both our Completions Services and Well Construction and Intervention Services segments include FTS International, Inc., Halliburton Company, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Superior Energy Services, Inc. and U.S. Well Services. We also compete regionally in each segment with a significant number of smaller service providers. 
Historically, our core competitive factors in the markets we serve have been our multi-basin service capability and close proximity to our customers, technical expertise, equipment reliability, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and prices. While these factors continue to dominate, we believe that our customers have begun to look beyond these core requirements to prefer suppliers that can provided integrated solutions that align the incentives of operators and service providers. 
While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers have elected to work with us based on our customer-tailored partnership approach, our safety record, the performance and competency of our crews and the quality of our equipment and our services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency, resulting in cost effective operations and a safe working environment. NexTier has also been developing and building its digital program for some time. We believe our digital program, continued investment in diesel substitution (such as duel fuel capabilities), and our integrated natural gas treatment and delivery solution are important to achieving emissions reductions initiatives, both for us and our customers, and provide a competitive differentiating factor. 
Raw materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a 
timely basis. While we believe we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, this may not always be the case. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, purchases from our largest supplier represented approximately 5% of the Company’s overall purchases.
Research & technology and intellectual property
We have invested in technological advancement, including the development of a state-of-the-art Innovation Center staffed by a team of highly skilled digital professionals and engineers. Our innovation efforts have been focused on fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our service offerings, increase efficiencies, lower our operating costs, optimize capital expenditures and add value for our customers. This includes developing an innovative digital infrastructure, NexHub, which is an internal, real-time, digital platform that allows around-the-clock remote operations support across our active fleets. Driven by artificial intelligent logistics and digital operations engineering, NexHub provides key benefits of remote operations to allow for less employees at the well-site, extended equipment life through equipment health monitoring with machine learning and generated alerts, rapid response and adjustment to changing wellsite and equipment conditions, enhanced service quality, and powers data driven decisions. 
Our research and development and digital initiatives generate recurring cost savings for our integrated completion services operations, which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns. Several of these investments provide value-added products and services that, in addition to producing revenue, are creating increasing demand from key customers. In our day-to-day operations, we utilize equipment and products manufactured by our vertically integrated businesses which are managed through our Innovation Center, and we may also sell such equipment and products to third-party customers in the global energy services industry. We believe that our focus on innovation, with the objective of reducing costs and improving sustainability of our operations, provides a strategic benefit through the ability to fund, develop, and implement new technologies and quickly respond to changes in customer requirements and industry demand.
We own a number of patents and have pending certain patent applications covering various products and services. We are also licensed to utilize technology covered by patents owned by others. Furthermore, we believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are valuable proprietary assets, and we have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide products or services. We do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, generally in the first and fourth quarters, related to the conclusion and restart of our customers’ annual capital expenditure budgets, the holidays and inclement winter weather, during which we may experience declines in our operating results. Our operations in North Dakota and Pennsylvania are particularly affected by seasonality due to inclement winter weather. During the spring and summer months, our operations in certain areas may be impacted by transportation restrictions due to the work-site conditions caused by the spring thaws or tropical weather systems.
Human Capital Resources
NexTier is committed to conducting our activities in a safe and responsible manner, while fostering a culture to treat every person with respect and dignity. We seek to attract, retain and develop high quality talent who can drive the success of our business while emulating our core values.
Health and Safety
In our industry, a strong safety record is key to attracting and retaining top-tier customers and employees. We believe we are among the safest service providers in the industry. In 2020, we achieved a total recordable 
incident rate of 0.42, which is substantially less than the 1.00 incident rate derived from an industry average from 2016 to 2019. We believe total recordable incident rate is a reliable measure of safety performance.
We offer comprehensive health and welfare, disability, and retirement benefits to eligible employees. The core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with discount programs for health-related goods and services, a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time off programs. Health benefits include low-cost telehealth services as well as mental and behavioral health resources, including on-demand access to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for employees and their dependents. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home for periods of time, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. To maintain minimized exposure points, a flex-work program was developed and deployed in an effort to balance time in the office with remote work from home. To mitigate COVID-19 exposure further pro-active measures have been implemented including, among other things, additional hand sanitizer stations; temperature check kiosks at the entrance to our corporate headquarters; eliminating guests to campuses; shifting all meetings to a virtual format; closing meeting rooms and common/shared areas in the office such as cafeterias and fitness rooms; mandatory face mask wearing (unless the person is eating or alone at work station); installation of signage for CDC guideline distancing and other reminders, and established absence management and tracing protocols to reduce transmission risk. Frequent and consistent communication efforts reinforce the importance of these health and safety measures. 
Growth and Development
Hiring, developing and retaining quality employees is important to maximize the success of our operations. We actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their career progression, supporting professional development and providing an on-demand learning platform. Competency assessments drive skill development plans and succession plans drive leadership development plans. To further support these objectives, we have designed human resources programs to:
•Enhance the company culture through employee experiences, policies and practices aimed at making the workplace more safe, healthy and inclusive;
•Align leader and team member behaviors to our purpose;
•Facilitate talent acquisition to create a high-performing and diverse workforce;
•Reward employees through competitive pay and benefits;
•Develop employees at all levels through learning strategies focused on new skills required to support operational excellence and advancement within the Company; and
•Evolve and invest in technology and other resources that enable employees to learn and grow more effectively.
General
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,969 employees, of which, approximately 73% were compensated on an hourly basis. This was approximately a 70% decrease from the 6,525 employees we had on December 31, 2019, and reflects the Company’s ongoing initiative to streamline its cost structure to ensure the Company has the most appropriate model in place to navigate the current market conditions stemming from, among other things, the impacts of COVID-19 and the resulting unforeseeable business circumstances, and to position the Company for success as the market recovers. 
Our employees are neither covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. While we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory, disputes may arise over certain classifications of employees that are customary in the oilfield services industry. We are not aware of any other potentially adverse matters involving our employment practices on a company-wide level.
Material Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, expenditures associated with exposure to hazardous materials, remediation of contamination, property damage and personal injuries, imposition of bond requirements, and restricting permits or other authorizations, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and clean-up costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Strict compliance with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements, including those that result in any limitation, suspension or moratorium on the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by federal, state, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund law”), and comparable state laws impose liability on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous or other state-regulated substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of the site and the owner or operator of the site at the time of the release and the parties that disposed or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or other state-regulated substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict liability, joint and several liability, or both, for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and human health without regard to fault. In addition, companies that incur CERCLA liability frequently confront claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous or other regulated substances or pollutants into the environment.
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and analogous state laws generally excludes oil and gas exploration and production wastes (e.g., drilling fluids, produced waters) from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes remain subject to potential regulation as solid wastes under RCRA and as hazardous waste under other state and local laws. Wastes from some of our operations (such as, but not limited to, our chemical development, blending and distribution operations, as well as some maintenance and manufacturing operations) are or may be regulated under RCRA and analogous state laws under certain circumstances. Further, any exemption or regulation under RCRA does not alter treatment of the substance under CERCLA. The impact of future revisions to environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted. Moreover, stricter standards for waste handling and disposal may be imposed on the oil and 
natural gas industry in the future. Removal of RCRA’s exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase waste disposal costs, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry. The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws. Standards have been developed for: worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws. It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States or state waters. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the EPA or applicable state agencies. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency have been uncertain for several years due to regulatory changes concerning clarity as to the scope of ‘waters of the United States’ federally regulated under the Act and litigation over those changes. The process for obtaining permits required by the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure regulations imposed under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak.
In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Moreover, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the OPA, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the federal Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and analogous state laws. Under these laws or other laws and regulations, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing and its use of fracturing fluids, including potential impacts of the process on drinking water supplies, on the use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the general environment. Companion bills entitled the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”) were first introduced in the United States Congress in 2009 and successor bills have been reintroduced in the House of Representatives on multiple occasions, most recently in July 2019. The 116th Congress did not act on that legislation before the session adjourned on January 3, 2021; it is possible that a version of the FRAC Act could be introduced for consideration by the 117th Congress. If the FRAC Act and other similar legislation were to pass, the legislation could significantly alter regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing. Currently, unless the fracturing fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process contains diesel fuel, hydraulic fracturing operations are exempt from permitting under the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established by the SDWA, but are subject to regulation by state oil and gas commissions. The FRAC Act would remove this exemption and subject hydraulic fracturing operations to permitting requirements under the UIC program. The FRAC Act and other similar bills propose to also require persons conducting hydraulic fracturing to disclose the chemical constituents of their fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, although they would not require 
the disclosure of the proprietary formulas except in cases of emergency. Currently, several states require public disclosure of non-proprietary chemicals on FracFocus.org and other equivalent Internet sites. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical formulas to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of those formulas and could result in competitive harm to our business. Moreover, in response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewater, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have imposed volumetric injection limits, shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on the FRAC Act or other related federal and state bills, or the ultimate impact of any such legislation.
If the FRAC Act or similar legislation becomes law, or the Department of the Interior or another federal agency asserts jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, additional regulatory requirements could be established at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing the costs of compliance and doing business for us and our customers. States in which we operate have considered and may again consider legislation that could impose additional regulations and/or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing.
In addition, at the direction of Congress, the EPA undertook a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and issued its report in December 2016. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Similarly, other federal and state studies may recommend additional requirements or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations.
Any regulation that restricts the ability to dispose of produced waters or increases the cost of doing business could cause curtailed or decreased demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. 
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. We are or may be required to obtain federal and state permits in connection with certain operations conducted in our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for filtering or other emissions control devices at each of our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit certain activities. Many of these regulatory requirements, including New Source Performance Standards and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards, have been made more stringent over time as a result of stricter national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment of the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our activities and our customers’ current E&P activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. The NEPA review process has the potential to delay the permitting and subsequent development of oil and natural gas projects.
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Government entities or private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages where harm to species, habitat or natural resources may result from the filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands, the construction of oil and gas facilities or the release of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must also designate the species’ critical habitat and suitable habitat as part of the effort to ensure survival of the species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If our customers were to have areas within their business and operations designated as critical or suitable habitat or a protected species, it could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these speculative federal, state or private actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations with respect to these matters.
More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur additional operating costs or reduce the demand for our services. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA and many scientists, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, EPA has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, including rules that require preconstruction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources.
The EPA has proposed and finalized a number of rules requiring various industry sectors to track and report, and, in some cases, control greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG sources, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Implementation and status of 2016 final rules that establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s final rule package included first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. However, regulatory developments to ease or rescind these rules have created uncertainty as to their impact on the oil and gas industry.
The trajectory of future greenhouse regulations remains unsettled. In March 2014, the White House announced its intention to consider further regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. It is unclear whether Congress will take further action on greenhouse gases, for example, to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions or alternatively to statutorily limit the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gases. However, almost one-half of the states have established or joined GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and, therefore, could reduce the demand for our products and services.
Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climatic changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Climate change regulation may also impact our business positively by increasing demand for natural gas for use in producing electricity and as a transportation fuel. Currently, our operations are not materially adversely impacted by existing state and local climate change initiatives. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business.
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly referred to as OSHA, and of comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, the new rule regarding respirable silica sand, which requires the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021.
Among the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period and requiring onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size, and setting minimum training standards for new drivers seeking a commercial driver’s license. Certain motor vehicle operators are required to register with the DOT. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The DOT periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria, and a revocation could result in a suspension of operations.
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
Some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(“NRC”) and state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. We believe that we have obtained these licenses and approvals as necessary and applicable. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution. In addition, releases of radioactive material could result in substantial remediation costs and potentially expose us to third-party property damage or personal injury claims.
We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through training of employees. We also maintain a pollution risk management program that is activated in the event a pollution event occurs. This program includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to fortuitous environmental pollution events. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address pollution incidents that result in bodily injury or property damage and any ensuing clean up required at our owned facilities, as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleets, as well as any environmental claims resulting from our operations.
We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that generally allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the hydraulic fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and risks relating to “down-hole” liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water, for which they use a controlled flow-back process. We are not involved in that process or the disposal of the resulting fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we generally indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act.
Overall, we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is possible, however, that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.
Insurance 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including blowouts, explosions, cratering, fires, oil spills, surface and underground pollution and contamination, hazardous material spills, loss of well control, damage to or loss of the wellbore, formation or underground reservoir, damage or loss from the use of explosives and radioactive materials, and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife, and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry.
Additionally, our business involves, and is subject to hazards associated with, the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, as well as heavily regulated explosive and radioactive materials. Regularly having a significant number of both commercial and non-commercial motor vehicles on the road creates a high risk of vehicle accidents. The occurrence of a serious accident involving our employees, equipment and/or services, could result in 
our being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims, and we may also be liable to indemnify certain third-parties, specifically including its customers, for large claims for damages in situations where our employees, equipment and/or services were involved.
Despite our efforts to maintain high safety standards, we from time to time have experienced accidents in the past, and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses. Historically, insurance rates have been subject to various market fluctuations that may result in less coverage, increased premium costs, or higher deductibles or self-insured retentions.
