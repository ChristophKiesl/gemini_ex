 Item 1. Business
 
References to “we”, “us”, “our”, “REX” or “the Company” refer to REX American Resources Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931. We have been an investor in ethanol production facilities beginning in 2006. We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities; we have a majority ownership interest in two of these entities. We may make additional investments in the energy industry in the future.
 
Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related to corn prices, at times ethanol and/or distillers grains prices may lag movements in corn prices and, in an environment of higher corn prices or lower ethanol/distillers grains prices, reduce the overall margin structure at the plants. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or marginally positive operating margins.

We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by 2.8) as the “crush spread.” Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants. We also expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 15.5 pounds of distillers grains and 0.7 pounds of non-food grade corn oil for each bushel of grain processed.
 
We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward grain purchase, forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts and commodity futures agreements as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol price. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities.
 
The crush spread realized in fiscal year 2016 was subject to significant volatility. For fiscal year 2016, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) near-month corn price ranged from a low of approximately $3.01 per bushel in August 2016 to a high of approximately $4.38 per bushel in June 2016. Corn prices benefitted throughout the year from four consecutive strong corn harvests between 2013 and 2016. Ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately $1.37 per gallon in August 2016 to a high of approximately $1.75 per gallon in December 2016. Ethanol prices were influenced by many factors throughout the year including low energy prices, varying levels of ethanol demand and increases in United States ethanol production. The CBOT crush spread during fiscal year 2016 ranged from approximately $0.07 in March 2016 to approximately $0.47 in December 2016.
 
Net income attributable to REX common shareholders was approximately $32.3 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to approximately $31.4 million in fiscal year 2015. The current year benefitted from higher crush spreads and production levels which were partially offset by lower dried distillers grains pricing. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $10.4 million from the sale of our interest in Patriot Holdings, LLC (“Patriot”). We expect that future operating results, from our consolidated plants, will be based upon combined annual production of between 240 and 270 million gallons of ethanol if the resulting crush spread is adequate. However, due to the inherent volatility of commodity prices within the ethanol industry, we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the fiscal year 2016 results.
 
We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.
 
Through a wholly owned subsidiary REX I.P., LLC, we entered into a joint venture with Hytken HPGP LLC (“Hytken”) to file and defend patents for eSteam technology relating to heavy oil and oil sands production methods, and to attempt to commercially exploit the technology to generate license fees, royalty income and development opportunities. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have paid approximately $1.7 million for our ownership interest, patent and other expenses, but have not successfully demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and Hytken owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC (“Future Energy”), an Ohio limited liability company. Future Energy is managed by a board of three managers, two appointed by us and one by Hytken.

Fiscal Year
 
All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX’s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, “fiscal year 2016” means the period February 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.
Alternative Energy Overview
 
We began investing in the ethanol industry during fiscal year 2006. We seek to identify quality ethanol plant opportunities located near adequate feedstock supply with good transportation capabilities or other economically beneficial attributes, and that utilize leading ethanol production technology.
 
The form and structure of our investments is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we are partnering. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants.

Ethanol Industry
 
Ethanol is a renewable fuel source produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as an additive or replacement to fossil fuel based gasoline. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in producing alcohol that is used in the fermentation process. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the ethanol plant facilities.
 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 15.3 billion gallons of ethanol in 2016. Approximately 14.4 billion gallons were blended domestically and approximately 1.0 billion gallons were exported in 2016. According to the RFA, as of January 2017, the United States ethanol industry has grown to 213 plants (200 operating) in 28 states with an annual capacity of approximately 16.0 billion gallons (approximately 15.6 billion gallons at operating plants) of ethanol production.
 
On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “Energy Act of 2007”) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. Corn-based ethanol is considered conventional biofuels which was subject to a renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) of at least 14.4 billion gallons in 2014 and 15.0 billion gallons thereafter through 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States.
 
In November 2013, the EPA released its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the 2014 RFS, seeking comment on a range of total renewable fuel volumes and proposing a level of 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billion gallons of conventional corn-derived renewable fuel. The proposal included a variety of approaches for setting the 2014 standard and a number of production and consumption ranges of biofuels covered by Renewable Fuel Standard II (“RFS II”) to address two constraints of RFS II: (1) the volume limitations of ethanol given the practical constraints of vehicles that can use higher ethanol blends, and (2) the industry’s ability to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November 2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program before the end of that year.

On June 10, 2015, the EPA proposed volume targets for conventional ethanol of 13.25 billion gallons, 13.40 billion gallons and 14.00 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. On November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol that were higher than levels proposed in June 2015 of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.50 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
 
In November 2016, the EPA announced the 2017 requirement of 15.0 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels which equals the statutory requirement. In January 2017, the Trump administration imposed a government wide freeze on new and pending regulations, which includes the 2017 renewable volume obligations. The freeze expired on March 21, 2017 with no change to the previously announced requirement.
 
Ethanol Production
 
The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as “meal,” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal co-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed and recovers a portion of the corn cost not absorbed in ethanol production. During fiscal year 2012, we began generating revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil at our One Earth and NuGen facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets.
The Primary Uses of Ethanol
 
Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Currently, ethanol is blended into approximately 98% of the gasoline sold in the United States, the majority as E-10 (a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), according to the RFA. Going forward, the industry is attempting to expand the E-85 market, as well as to raise the federal cap on ethanol blend above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of 15% ethanol in gasoline for cars, SUV’s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. Despite this, it will take time for this measure to be implemented and is still being met with great resistance. Ethanol accounted for approximately 10.1% of the total U.S. gasoline supply for 2016.
 
Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely and reduce emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards.
 
Octane enhancer.  Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As such, ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades.

Legislation
 
The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.
Facilities
 
At January 31, 2017, our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined 477 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 247 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2016. We also own our corporate headquarters office building, consisting of approximately 7,500 square feet, located in Dayton, Ohio.
Employees
 
At January 31, 2017, we had 114 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Service Marks
 
We have registered the service marks “REX”, and “Farmer’s Energy”, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks.
