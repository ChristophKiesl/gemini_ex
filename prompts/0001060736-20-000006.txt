Item 1. Business
Overview
Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes therapies targeting cancer. We are commercializing ADCETRIS®, or brentuximab vedotin, for the trbreatment of certain CD30-expressing lymphomas, and PADCEVTM, or enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, for the treatment of certain metastatic urothelial cancers. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Many of our programs, including ADCETRIS and PADCEV, are based on our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology that utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. 
ADCETRIS is commercially available in more than 70 countries worldwide. We commercialize ADCETRIS in the U.S. and its territories and in Canada, and we collaborate with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world and pays us a royalty. ADCETRIS is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in six indications. In Hodgkin lymphoma, ADCETRIS is approved as monotherapy for patients whose disease has relapsed and as consolidation therapy following prior treatment, and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with previously untreated disease. In T-cell lymphomas, ADCETRIS is approved as monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL, or certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and in combination with chemotherapy for patients with previously untreated CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL.
Beyond our current labeled indications, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in several clinical trials. These include a potentially registration-enabling trial evaluating treatment with ADCETRIS in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL patients who are unfit for combination chemotherapy, and a potentially registration-enabling trial evaluating retreatment with ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma patients who progress after a prior response, including in the frontline setting. In addition, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma under a clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. Nivolumab is a programmed death-1, or PD-1, immune checkpoint inhibitor. 
Our second marketed product PADCEV, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery or in a locally advanced or metastatic setting. It is the first FDA approved treatment for these patients. PADCEV was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response rate. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. A global, randomized phase 3 clinical trial, called EV-301, which is a required confirmatory trial, is ongoing and is also intended to support global registrations. We completed enrollment in the trial in January 2020.
PADCEV is being co-developed and jointly commercialized with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas. In the U.S., we and Astellas are jointly promoting PADCEV. In the U.S. we record net sales of PADCEV and are responsible for all distribution activities. We and Astellas each bear the costs of our own sales organizations in the U.S., equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing PADCEV in the U.S., and equally share in any profits realized in the U.S. 
FDA approval of PADCEV was supported by data from a single-arm pivotal phase 2 clinical trial called EV-201. The trial enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy. Positive results from the first cohort were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2019 annual meeting and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. We are continuing enrollment in the EV-201 trial for the second cohort of patients who previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, but who were not candidates for treatment with a platinum agent, which we believe could potentially serve as the basis for a second indication. 
PADCEV is also being investigated in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer and earlier stages of bladder cancer. We and Astellas are conducting a phase 1/2 clinical trial, called EV-103, that is a multi-cohort, open-label trial of PADCEV alone or in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy. The trial is evaluating safety, tolerability and activity in locally advanced and first- and second-line metastatic urothelial cancer, and was recently expanded to include muscle invasive bladder cancer. In September 2019, initial results from the trial in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were ineligible for treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2019 Congress, that demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate, or ORR, of 71 percent and met safety outcome measures. 
Positive initial data from the EV-103 trial support a recently initiated global, registrational phase 3 trial, called EV-302, in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer that is being conducted under a clinical collaboration agreement between us, Astellas and Merck. Under the terms of the agreement, we, Astellas and Merck are jointly funding EV-302. The trial was initiated in January 2020 and the trial is being led by us. EV-302 is an open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the combination of PADCEV and pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The trial is expected to enroll 1,095 patients and the dual primary endpoints are progression-free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. 
In addition in January 2020, we and Astellas initiated a phase 2 clinical trial, called EV-202, to evaluate PADCEV monotherapy in solid tumors that have high-levels of Nectin-4 expression, including non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric/esophageal and breast cancers.
The most advanced program in our clinical pipeline is tucatinib, an oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor overexpressed in many cancers. Positive results from the tucatinib HER2CLIMB-01 pivotal trial were presented in December 2019 at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. HER2CLIMB-01 is a randomized pivotal clinical trial comparing tucatinib added to trastuzumab and capecitabine versus trastuzumab and capecitabine alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or T-DM1.
Based on the HER2CLIMB-01 results, in December 2019, tucatinib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases, who have been treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1. Also in December 2019, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA under Oncology Center of Excellence's, or OCE's, Real Time Oncology Review, or RTOR, pilot program. We are also participating in the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA OCE which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. Countries currently included in this initiative are Australia, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.S. In addition to the U.S., applications for approval were submitted to the other participating countries. In January 2020, we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the submission was validated, which confirms it is sufficiently complete to begin the formal review process. 
We intend to conduct a broad clinical development program of tucatinib in earlier lines of breast cancer and in other HER2-positive cancers. In October 2019, we initiated a phase 3 randomized trial, called HER2CLIMB-02, of tucatinib versus placebo, in combination with T-DM1 for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, who have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab. 
We are also conducting a phase 2 trial, called MOUNTAINEER, evaluating tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer after treatment with first- and second-line standard-of-care therapies. Initial results from 23 patients were presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress that demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity. We have expanded enrollment in the trial so that it could potentially support an application for accelerated approval in the U.S. 
In collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, we are developing tisotumab vedotin, which is an ADC targeting tissue factor. We and Genmab are conducting a pivotal phase 2 trial, called the innovaTV 204 trial, evaluating single-agent tisotumab vedotin for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed after standard of care treatment. The trial is intended to support a potential regulatory submission under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway. In March 2019, we completed enrollment in the innovaTV 204 trial and we anticipate reporting topline data from the trial in the first half of 2020. We are also conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called innovaTV 207 for patients with relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors which is intended to inform future development plans. In addition, we are conducting a phase 2 clinical trial, called innovaTV 208, for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
We are developing ladiratuzumab vedotin, an ADC targeting LIV-1, which is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents for patients with metastatic breast cancer and select solid tumors with high LIV-1 expression. 
We are advancing a pipeline of early-stage clinical candidates as well as multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We have advanced several product candidates into clinical development in 2019 and we plan to submit several investigational new drug applications, or INDs, to the FDA in 2020. 
We have active license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; and Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc, as well as collaboration agreements with Astellas and Genmab. Genentech and GSK have ADCs using our technology in late-stage clinical trials. In June 2019, Genentech received accelerated approval from the FDA and, in January 2020, received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission for Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin-piic), an ADC that uses our technology, to treat patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Under our ADC license agreement with Genentech, the accelerated approval of Polivy triggered a milestone payment to us and we also receive royalties on net sales of Polivy worldwide. In January 2020, the FDA granted priority review for GSK's Biologics License Application, or BLA, and in February 2020 the EMA validated GSK's MAA for belantamab mafodotin, an additional ADC that uses our technology, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Additionally, GSK initiated a phase 3 clinical trial of belantamab mafodotin in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to become a global oncology company developing and marketing targeted therapies for cancer. Key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Successfully Execute Our ADCETRIS Commercial Plan. We continue to focus our efforts on commercializing ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada, particularly its use for previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma and CD30-expressing PTCL, through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing, reimbursement and market planning groups. Beyond the frontline setting in the U.S. and Canada, ADCETRIS is approved by the FDA for four additional indications in other settings for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas. In addition, we are continuing to support Takeda’s efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and conduct commercial launches in additional countries worldwide.


• | Expand the Therapeutic Potential of ADCETRIS. We believe ADCETRIS may have additional applications in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and other types of CD30-expressing lymphomas. Clinical trials are being conducted by us, including ones that are potentially registration-enabling, as well as by our collaborators and by investigators in different CD30-expressing indications. They include novel combinations of ADCETRIS plus other anticancer agents and in other areas of medical and scientific interest. Several clinical trials are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in various lymphoma settings. 


• | Successfully Commercialize PADCEV in the U.S. and Seek Approval in Other Territories Globally. We and our partner Astellas are focused on commercializing PADCEV in the U.S. following accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2019. We have established an experienced commercial team that is providing information to patients and physicians as to the efficacy and safety of PADCEV for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer. We are also advancing a global, randomized phase 3 clinical trial, EV-301, that is intended to support global regulatory applications for potential approvals.


• | Expand the Therapeutic Potential of PADCEV. We are conducting trials evaluating PADCEV both as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents in different settings of urothelial cancer. We have initiated a registration-enabling phase 3 trial of PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab for previously untreated metastatic urothelial cancer based on positive results from the EV-103 trial. Additionally, we are investigating PADCEV in a phase 1/2 trial for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, an earlier non-metastatic stage of the disease, as well as in other solid tumors.


• | Seek Approval and Commercialize Tucatinib in the U.S., Europe and Other Territories Globally. Our efforts are focused on advancing applications for approval submitted to the FDA in December 2019 and the EMA in January 2020 for patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Our strategy is to commercialize tucatinib in the U.S., Europe and additional countries globally.


• | Expand the Therapeutic Potential of Tucatinib in Earlier Lines of HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer and Other HER2-Positive Cancers. We are advancing a registration-enabling phase 3 trial of tucatinib in combination with T-DM1 in previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that would potentially support use in earlier lines of therapy. In addition, we are conducting a phase 2 trial in HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer.


• | Advance Our Clinical Pipeline of Oncology Drugs. We are deploying our clinical, development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise with the goal of advancing our product candidates. Our key efforts in this regard include:


◦ | Advance Tisotumab Vedotin including in a Pivotal Trial for Cervical Cancer. We and Genmab are conducting a pivotal phase 2 trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed after standard of care treatment. In addition, as part of our strategy to broadly investigate tisotumab vedotin for cancer we and Genmab are conducting clinical trials for patients in other solid tumors that are intended to inform future development plans.


◦ | Continue to Develop Our Other Pipeline Programs. We believe that it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of product candidates to sustain our future growth. To accomplish this, we are continuing to advance the development of our other clinical product candidates as well as other preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We are evaluating our programs as monotherapy, and in some cases in combination with other anticancer agents such as checkpoint inhibitors, to broadly assess the potential of our pipeline as part of existing and emerging therapeutic regimens.


• | Support Growth of Our Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts, and Enter Into Strategic Transactions and Collaborations. We have internal research programs directed at identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, creating new antibody engineering techniques and developing new classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents for our ADC technology. In addition, we supplement these internal efforts through ongoing initiatives to identify product candidates, products and technologies to acquire or in-license from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We have also entered into collaborations to broaden and accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations may be entered into in order to supplement our own internal expertise in key areas such as manufacturing, regulatory affairs and clinical development, or provide us with access to our collaborators’ marketing, sales and distribution capabilities in specific territories.


• | Continue to Expand Globally. We have established operations in Zug, Switzerland and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands to support our operations within Europe. We acquired global rights to tucatinib in 2018, and we plan to continue to develop our European presence in support of our commercialization of tucatinib in Europe. We plan to expand globally in stages and are evaluating different alternatives for tucatinib commercialization in regions outside of the United States, Canada and Western Europe including potential distributorships, partnering and out-license arrangements.


• | Continue to Leverage Our Industry-Leading ADC Technology. We have developed proprietary ADC technology designed to empower monoclonal antibodies. We are currently developing multiple product candidates that employ our ADC technology and we have also licensed this technology to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to generate collaboration revenues and funding, as well as potential milestones and potential future royalties. Presently, we have active ADC license agreements with AbbVie, Genentech, GSK, and Progenics, as well as collaboration agreements with Astellas and Genmab. ADC collaboration and license agreements have generated over $425 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily in the form of upfront and milestone payments. In June 2019, Genentech received approval for Polivy from the FDA and, in January 2020, from the European Commission. In January 2020, the FDA granted priority review for GSK's Biologics License Application, or BLA, and in February 2020 the EMA validated GSK's MAA for belantamab mafodotin for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody.

Marketed Products

ADCETRIS is commercially available in more than 70 countries worldwide.
Market Opportunities 
According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 8,500 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are expected to be diagnosed in the United States during 2020, and an estimated 1,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Approximately 4,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the United States with a type of CD30-expressing PTCL, including sALCL. The standard of care frontline therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL has seen limited improvement over the last few decades. Additionally, these chemotherapy regimens have substantial associated toxicities and a significant number of lymphoma patients relapse and require additional treatments including other chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT. An estimated 1,000 people annually have CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides or primary cutaneous ALCL requiring systemic therapy.
PADCEV
PADCEV is an ADC targeting Nectin-4, a protein expressed on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer as well as other cancers. PADCEV was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery or in a locally advanced or metastatic setting. It is the first FDA approved treatment for these patients. PADCEV is approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response rate. The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows approval of a medicine based on a surrogate endpoint, such as tumor response rate, if the medicine fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition. A global, randomized phase 3 clinical trial, EV-301, which is a required confirmatory trial, completed enrollment in January 2020 and is also intended to support global registrations.
The primary basis for the BLA submission to the FDA was the positive EV-201 pivotal trial results of PADCEV. EV-201 is a phase 2 multi-center trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy. In the trial, the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR was 44 percent per blinded independent central review (55/125; 95 percent Confidence Interval, or CI,: 35.1, 53.2). Among patients treated with the single agent PADCEV, 12 percent (15/125) experienced a complete response, meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment, and 32 percent (40/125) experienced a partial response, meaning a decrease in tumor size or extent of cancer in the body. The median duration of response, or DoR, a secondary endpoint, was 7.6 months (95 percent CI: 6.3, not estimable). The most common serious adverse reactions (≥3 percent) were urinary tract infection (6 percent), cellulitis (5 percent), febrile neutropenia (4 percent), diarrhea (4 percent), sepsis (3 percent), acute kidney injury (3 percent), dyspnea (3 percent), and rash (3 percent). The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6 percent). The most common adverse reactions (≥20 percent) were fatigue (56 percent), peripheral neuropathy (56 percent), decreased appetite (52 percent), rash (52 percent), alopecia (50 percent), nausea (45 percent), dysgeusia (42 percent), diarrhea (42 percent), dry eye (40 percent), pruritus (26 percent) and dry skin (26 percent). The most common Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5 percent) were rash (13 percent), diarrhea (6 percent) and fatigue (6 percent).
Market Opportunities
Approximately 154,000 people in the United States will present annually with the need for treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent bladder cancer. This includes approximately 20,000 with metastatic disease, 28,000 with muscle invasive disease and 106,000 with non-muscle invasive disease. In the metastatic setting, several PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved for urothelial cancer in the past several years and are improving outcomes for some patients, yet the vast majority of patients do not benefit, or relapse, and require additional treatment options. Prior to the approval of PADCEV in the U.S. there were no approved agents in the post-platinum-based therapy and post-checkpoint inhibitor setting, representing an unmet medical need. We are conducting clinical trials in frontline metastatic disease and in muscle invasive bladder cancer. In addition, we are working on a development strategy in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Development Status
ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) 
Beyond our current labeled indications, we are evaluating ADCETRIS monotherapy and in combination with other agents in ongoing trials. In addition to our corporate-sponsored trials there are numerous investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS in the United States. The investigator-sponsored trials include the use of ADCETRIS in a number of malignant hematologic indications and in solid tumors. Several investigator-sponsored trials are currently evaluating ADCETRIS with immuno-oncology compounds in Hodgkin lymphoma, and we expect that additional investigator-sponsored trials might evaluate ADCETRIS in novel combination regimens.
Recent clinical data and analyses from select trials of ADCETRIS were presented at the 61st American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December 2019 including: 

• | Four-Year Update of the phase 3 ECHELON-1 Trial. As previously reported, the ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], vinblastine and dacarbazine) resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified PFS compared to the control arm of ABVD, which includes bleomycin. A four-year post-hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to examine PFS outcomes per investigator assessment in the intent-to-treat population of 1,334 patients. The four-year PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.7 percent compared to 75.1 percent in the ABVD arm, a difference of 6.6 percent (hazard ratio, or HR, =0.69; 95 percent CI: 0.542, 0.881; p=0.003). This represents a 31 percent reduction in the risk of progression or death. Median follow-up time was 48.4 months. As previously reported for the primary analysis, on the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67 percent of patients compared to 43 percent in the ABVD arm. The four-year update shows that among patients with peripheral neuropathy, 83 percent in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and 84 percent in the ABVD arm reported complete resolution or improvement at last follow-up. 


• | Phase 2 Study of Frontline ADCETRIS Plus Nivolumab in Patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma Aged ≥ 60 Years. Data were presented from an updated analysis of the phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab as frontline therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma patients aged 60 years and older. Data were reported from 21 patients, and the median age was 72 years. The majority of patients (76 percent) had stage III/IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Of 19 response-evaluable patients, 18 patients (95 percent) had an objective response, including 13 patients (68 percent) with a complete response and five patients (26 percent) with a partial response. All response-evaluable patients experienced tumor reduction (complete response + partial response + stable disease) following treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab. Median duration of response was not yet reached after median follow-up of 6.8 months and the maximum duration of response was 22 months and ongoing (95 percent CI: 7.06, not estimable). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 20 percent of patients were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, infusion related reaction, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy and increase in lipase. One treatment-related serious adverse event was pyrexia.

PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-efjv)
PADCEV is an ADC composed of an anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. Nectin-4 is a novel target expressed in multiple cancers including urothelial cancers, such as bladder cancer, as well as ovarian and lung cancers. We are developing PADCEV as a potential treatment for solid tumors under our collaboration with Astellas. 
We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial, called EV-201, of single-agent PADCEV for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have been previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Results from the first cohort of patients who previously received both platinum chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor were submitted to the FDA in July 2019 for accelerated approval which was subsequently granted in December 2019. We are continuing enrollment in a second cohort of patients who previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor but who were not candidates for treatment with a platinum agent, which we believe could potentially serve as the basis for a second indication. 
We and Astellas are also conducting a phase 1/2 trial, called EV-103, that is a multi-cohort, open-label trial of PADCEV alone or in combination with the immune therapy pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy. The trial is evaluating safety, tolerability and activity in locally advanced and first- and second-line metastatic urothelial cancer, and was recently expanded to include muscle invasive bladder cancer. In September 2019, initial results from the trial were presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress. Forty-five patients were evaluated for safety with the combination of PADCEV and pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were ineligible for treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The trial met outcomes for safety and the data indicated that the combination of PADCEV plus pembrolizumab shrank tumors in the majority of patients, resulting in a confirmed ORR of 71 percent (95 percent CI: 55.7, 83.6). The complete response rate was 13 percent. Fifty-eight percent of patients had a partial response and 22 percent had stable disease. Ninety-one percent of responses were observed at the first assessment. The duration of response range was from one to 10.5 months and ongoing. Fifty-one percent of patients had an adverse event greater than or equal to Grade 3. Among these events, an increase in lipase was the most frequent (13 percent). Four patients (9 percent) discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events, most commonly peripheral sensory neuropathy. There was one death deemed to be treatment-related by the investigator attributed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 
Positive initial data from the EV-103 trial support a recently initiated global, registrational phase 3 trial, called EV-302, in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer that is being conducted under a clinical collaboration agreement between us, Astellas and Merck. Under the terms of the agreement, the three companies are jointly funding EV-302. The trial was initiated in January 2020 and is being led by Seattle Genetics. EV-302 is an open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the combination of PADCEV and pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The trial is expected to enroll 1,095 patients and the dual primary endpoints are PFS and OS. 
We and Astellas have also initiated a phase 2 clinical trial, EV-202, to evaluate PADCEV monotherapy in solid tumors that have high-level of Nectin-4 expression that include non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric/esophageal and breast cancers. 
Tucatinib
Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule TKI that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor overexpressed in many cancers, including breast, colorectal esophageal, gastric, lung and ovarian cancers. Preclinical data indicate that tucatinib is highly selective for HER2 without significant inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR. Inhibition of EGFR has been associated with significant toxicities, including skin rash and diarrhea. HER2 mediates cell growth, differentiation and survival. Tumors that over-express HER2 are generally more aggressive and historically have been associated with poor overall survival, compared with HER2-negative cancers. 
Tucatinib was evaluated in the HER2CLIMB-01 clinical trial which was a multinational randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, pivotal clinical trial comparing tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine compared with trastuzumab and capecitabine alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1. The primary endpoint was PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, v1.1 as determined by blinded independent central review in the first 480 patients enrolled in the trial. HER2CLIMB-01 enrolled a total of 612 patients to support the analyses of key secondary endpoints, including overall survival as well as PFS in patients with brain metastases at baseline. Forty-seven percent of the patients enrolled in the trial had brain metastases at the time of enrollment.
In October 2019, we announced positive topline results from the HER2CLIMB-01 trial and in December 2019 additional details were presented at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial met the primary endpoint of PFS, demonstrating that the addition of tucatinib was superior to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone, with a 46 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR=0.54; 95 percent CI: 0.42, 0.71; p<0.00001). Estimated PFS at one year was 33 percent (95 percent CI: 27, 40) in the tucatinib arm, compared to 12 percent (95 percent CI: 6, 21) in the trastuzumab and capecitabine arm (control arm). Median PFS was 7.8 months (95 percent CI: 7.5, 9.6) in the tucatinib arm, compared to 5.6 months (95 percent CI: 4.2, 7.1) in the control arm.
The trial also met all secondary endpoints at interim analysis. The tucatinib arm demonstrated an improvement in OS, with a 34 percent reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.66; 95 percent CI: 0.50, 0.88; p=0.0048) compared to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. Estimated OS at two years was 45 percent (95 percent CI: 37, 53) in the tucatinib arm, compared to 27 percent (95 percent CI: 16, 39) in the control arm. Median OS was 21.9 months (95 percent CI: 18.3, 31.0) in the tucatinib arm, compared to 17.4 months (95 percent CI: 13.6, 19.9) in the control arm. For patients with brain metastases at baseline, the tucatinib arm also demonstrated superior PFS, with a 52 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to those who received trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (HR=0.48; 95 percent CI: 0.34, 0.69; p<0.00001). The estimated PFS at one year was 25 percent (95 percent CI: 17, 34) with the tucatinib regimen, compared to zero percent in the control arm. Median PFS was 7.6 months (95 percent CI: 6.2, 9.5) in the tucatinib arm, compared to 5.4 months (95 percent CI: 4.1, 5.7) in the control arm. Additionally, the confirmed ORR in the patient population with measurable disease at baseline (511/612) was 40.6 percent (95 percent CI: 35.3, 46.0) in the tucatinib arm, compared with 22.8 percent (95 percent CI: 16.7, 29.8) for trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (p=0.0008).
Tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 20 percent of patients in the tucatinib arm vs. the control arm included: diarrhea (80.9 vs. 53.3 percent), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE) (63.4 vs. 52.8 percent), nausea (58.4 vs. 43.7 percent), fatigue (45.0 vs. 43.1 percent) and vomiting (35.9 vs. 25.4 percent), which were primarily low grade. Discontinuation of tucatinib and placebo due to adverse events was 5.7 percent in the tucatinib arm and 3.0 percent in the control arm. Greater than or equal to Grade 3 diarrhea was seen in 12.9 percent of the patients in the tucatinib arm vs. 8.6 percent in the control arm. Antidiarrheal prophylaxis was not required per protocol. Antidiarrheals were used in less than half of all cycles where diarrhea was reported. In both treatment arms, when used, the duration of antidiarrheal treatment was short (median of 3 days/cycle). Greater than or equal to Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, was seen in 4.5 percent of the patients in the tucatinib arm vs. 0.5 percent in the control arm, and alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, elevation in 5.4 percent vs. 0.5 percent, respectively. Discontinuations due to liver transaminase elevations were infrequent in both arms (ALT: 1.0 vs. 0.5 percent; AST: 0.7 vs. 0.5 percent).
Based on the HER2CLIMB-01 results, we submitted an NDA to the FDA in December 2019 and in January 2020 submitted a MAA to the EMA. In the U.S., we are participating in the FDA OCE's RTOR pilot program. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data earlier, before the applicant formally submits the complete application so that by the time of the submission of the application, the agency’s review team is in a better position to conduct a more efficient review. We are also participating in the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA OCE, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. Countries currently included in this initiative are Australia, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and U.S. 
In October 2019, we initiated a phase 3 randomized trial, called HER2CLIMB-02, of tucatinib versus placebo, in combination with T-DM1 for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, who have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab. HER2CLIMB-02 was initiated based on positive results from a completed phase 1b trial. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 460 patients. The primary endpoint is PFS.
We are also conducting a phase 2 trial, called MOUNTAINEER, evaluating tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer after treatment with first- and second-line standard-of-care therapies. Initial results from 23 patients were presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress that demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with an ORR of 52 percent. The median PFS was 8.1 months and the median OS was 18.7 months. The combination was generally well tolerated. We have expanded enrollment in the trial so it may support potential application for approval. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR.
Tisotumab Vedotin
Tisotumab vedotin is an ADC composed of a human antibody that binds to tissue factor, or TF, linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. TF is expressed on many solid tumors, including cervical, ovarian, prostate and bladder. We are developing tisotumab vedotin as a potential treatment for solid tumors under our collaboration with Genmab. This collaboration is discussed in more detail under “Corporate Collaborations” in this Item 1.
We and Genmab are conducting a pivotal phase 2 trial, called the innovaTV 204 trial, evaluating single-agent tisotumab vedotin for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed after standard of care treatment. The trial is intended to support a potential regulatory submission under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. In March 2019, we completed enrollment in the innovaTV 204 trial and we anticipate reporting topline data from the trial in the first half of 2020. We are also conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called innovaTV 207 for patients with relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, which is intended to inform future development plans. In addition, we are conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called innovaTV 208 for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Other Pipeline Activities
We are developing ladiratuzumab vedotin, an ADC targeting LIV-1, which is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents for patients with metastatic breast cancer and select solid tumors with high LIV-1 expression. 
We are advancing a pipeline of early-stage clinical candidates as well as multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We advanced several product candidates into clinical development in 2019 and we plan to submit several IND applications to the FDA in 2020. 
Our Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Technology
ADCETRIS, PADCEV and many product candidates in our clinical-stage pipeline utilize our ADC technology. ADCs are monoclonal antibodies that are linked to cytotoxic, or cell-killing, agents. Our ADCs utilize monoclonal antibodies that internalize within target cells after binding to a specified cell-surface receptor. Enzymes present inside the cell catalyze the release of the cytotoxic agent from the monoclonal antibody, which then results in the desired activity, specific killing of the target cell.
A key component of our ADCs are the linkers that attach the cell-killing agent to the monoclonal antibody, which are designed to hold the cytotoxic agent to the monoclonal antibody until it binds to the cell surface receptor on the target cell and then to release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization within the target cell. This targeted delivery of the cell-killing agent is intended to maximize delivery of the cytotoxic agent to targeted cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Our most advanced ADCs, including ADCETRIS, PADCEV, tisotumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, use our proprietary auristatin-based ADC technology. Auristatins are microtubule disrupting agents. In contrast to natural products that are often more difficult to produce and link to antibodies, the cytotoxic drugs used in our ADCs are synthetically produced and easier to scale for manufacturing. This technology is also the basis of our ADC collaborations. We own or hold exclusive or partially-exclusive licenses to multiple issued patents and patent applications covering our ADC technology. We continue to evaluate new linkers, antibody formats and cell-killing agents for use in our ADC programs.
Our Sugar-Engineered Antibody (SEA) Technology
Our proprietary SEA technology is a method to selectively reduce fucose incorporation in monoclonal antibodies as they are produced in cell line-based manufacturing. We believe that this may result in increased effector function and antitumor activity. Our SEA technology is a novel approach to modify the activity of monoclonal antibodies that is complementary to our ADC technology.
A key feature of our SEA technology is that no genetic modification of the antibody-producing cell line is necessary and standard cell culture conditions can be used while maintaining the underlying manufacturing processes, yields and product quality. We believe the SEA approach may be simpler and more cost-effective to implement as compared to existing technologies for enhancing antibody effector function, most of which require development of new cell lines. 
SEA-BCMA is a clinical-stage non-fucosylated BCMA-directed antibody developed using SEA technology that is designed to block proliferative tumor cell signaling, mediate antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis and induce enhanced cell lysis through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The cell surface protein BCMA is expressed on cells of several cancer types, including multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies. SEA-BCMA is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Other Technologies
In addition, we utilize other technologies designed to maximize antitumor activity and reduce toxicity of antibody-based therapies. Genetic engineering enables us to produce antibodies that are optimized for their intended uses. For ADCs, we screen and select antibodies that bind to antigens that are differentially expressed on tumor cells versus vital normal tissues, rapidly internalized within target cells and utilize native or engineered conjugation sites to optimize drug attachment. In some cases, we evaluate the use of our monoclonal antibodies and ADCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy and other anticancer agents, which may result in increased antitumor activity. 
Research Programs
In addition to our pipeline of current product candidates and technologies, we have internal research programs directed toward developing new classes of potent anti-tumor agents, new ADC linkers, the identification of novel drug targets and monoclonal antibodies, and by advancing our antibody engineering initiatives.
New Tumor Cell-Killing Agents. We continue to identify and study new agents with anti-tumor mechanisms of action that will provide pipeline diversity and complement the auristatins that we currently use in our ADC technology. We also seek to develop new drugs that are designed to activate the host immune system by targeting key immune stimulatory pathways that can mediate innate or adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. 
New Drug Linkers. We are conducting research with the intent to develop new ADC linkers that are designed to provide the appropriate stability in the bloodstream and drug release characteristics to effectively target cancer cells.
Novel Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen Targets. We are actively engaged in internal efforts to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic molecules, to target tumor antigens and important tumor or immune pathways. For ADCs, we focus on drug targets that are highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells that have the appropriate expression, distribution and internalization properties that make them desirable as monoclonal antibody or ADC targets. We may then create and screen panels of cancer-reactive monoclonal antibodies in our laboratories to identify those with the desired specificity and drug delivery properties. Additionally, we identify targets that play key roles in anti-tumor innate or adaptive immune responses and identify antibodies and other therapeutic molecules to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response. We supplement these internal efforts by evaluating opportunities to in-license targets and antibodies from academic groups and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as our ongoing collaborations with Astellas and Genmab.
Antibody Engineering. We have substantial internal expertise in antibody engineering including humanization, antibody masking technologies to enhance cancer specific binding, enhancement of immunological function by blocking fucosylation, as well as engineering antibodies to improve drug linkage sites for use with our ADC technology. By modifying the number and type of drug-linkage sites found on our antibodies, we believe that we can improve ADC drug properties and the cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing processes for conjugation of ADCs.
Corporate Collaborations
We enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement our internal pipeline. We seek collaborations that will allow us to retain significant future participation in product sales through either profit-sharing or royalties paid on net sales. We also have licensed our technologies to collaborators to be developed with their own antibodies. These collaborations benefit us in many ways, including generating cash flow and revenues that partially offset expenditures on our internal research and development programs, expanding our knowledge base regarding ADCs across multiple targets and antibodies provided by our collaborators and providing us with future pipeline opportunities through co-development or opt-in rights to new product candidates.
Takeda ADCETRIS Collaboration
We have an agreement with Takeda for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We have commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the U.S. and its territories and in Canada. Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. Under the collaboration, we and Takeda can each conduct development activities and equally co-fund the cost of certain mutually agreed development activities. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.
As of December 31, 2019, we had achieved milestone payments totaling $157.5 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda. As of December 31, 2019, total future potential milestone payments to us under this collaboration could total $77.0 million. Of that amount, up to approximately $7.0 million relates to the achievement of development milestones, and up to $70.0 million relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones. In addition, we recognize royalty revenues, where royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS in its licensed territories, with percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers, and sales-based milestones. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS, which is included in royalty revenues. 
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us and we may terminate the collaboration agreement in certain circumstances. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party terminates the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the expiration of all payment obligations.
Astellas PADCEV Collaboration
We have a collaboration agreement with Agensys, Inc., which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets. Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development costs for PADCEV. We rely on Astellas to supply PADCEV for commercial sales and for our clinical trials, and Astellas oversees the manufacturing supply chain for PADCEV. 
In 2018, we and Astellas entered into a joint commercialization agreement to govern the global commercialization of PADCEV:

• | In the U.S., we and Astellas jointly promote PADCEV. We record sales of PADCEV in the U.S. and are responsible for all U.S. distribution activities. The companies each bear the costs of their own sales organizations in the U.S., equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing PADCEV in the U.S., and equally share in any profits realized in the U.S.


• | Outside the U.S., we have commercialization rights in all countries in North and South America, and Astellas has commercialization rights in the rest of the world, including Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. The agreement is intended to provide that we and Astellas will effectively equally share in costs incurred and any profits realized in all of these markets. Cost and profit sharing in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy will be based on product sales and costs of commercialization. In the remaining markets, the commercializing party will bear costs and will pay the other party a royalty rate applied to net sales of the product based on a rate intended to approximate an equal profit share for both parties.

Astellas or its affiliates are responsible for manufacturing PADCEV for development and commercial use. However, we are responsible for packaging and labeling in countries in which we sell PADCEV. In addition if the parties determine that a second source is required we will be responsible for establishing such second source whether internal or through a third party.
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Subject to certain restrictions, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the other party. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of the expiration of all payment obligations pursuant to the collaboration agreement, or the day upon which we and Astellas cease to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. 
Either party may terminate the joint commercialization agreement if the other party becomes insolvent. The joint commercialization agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon complete cessation of the commercialization, launch and selling of PADCEV in that country.
Either party may also opt out of co-development and profit-sharing under the collaboration agreement in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. In addition, either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing for PADCEV on a country-by-country basis, in return for receiving royalties pursuant to the collaboration agreement from the continuing party with respect to that country.
Genmab Tisotumab Vedotin Collaboration
We have an agreement with Genmab to develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer, under which we previously exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin. We and Genmab will share all future costs and profits for development and commercialization of tisotumab vedotin on an equal basis. 
We will be responsible for tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Genmab will be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. We are currently in discussions with Genmab regarding the detailed terms on which we will work together to commercialize tisotumab vedotin under this agreement. 
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. In addition, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if such party’s patent rights subject to the agreement are challenged by the other party or its sublicensees. Either party may also opt out of co-development and profit-sharing under the collaboration agreement in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party.
ADC License Agreements
We have license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these agreements, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we have granted research and commercial licenses to use our technology, most often in conjunction with the licensee's technology. In certain agreements, we also have agreed to conduct limited development activities and to provide other materials, supplies, and services to our licensees during a specified term of the agreement. We typically receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. We also are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of any resulting products incorporating our ADC technology. Our licensees are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these agreements, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones.
In 2019, Genentech received accelerated approval from the FDA for PolivyTM (polatuzumab vedotin-piic), an ADC that uses our technology, to treat patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Under our ADC license agreement with Genentech, the accelerated approval of Polivy triggered a milestone payment to us and we also receive royalties on net sales of Polivy worldwide. In addition, Genentech and GSK have ADCs using our technology in late-stage clinical trials. The product candidates being developed under our other ADC license agreements are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development. Our ability to generate significant future revenues from our ADC license agreements will largely depend on products that incorporate our technologies entering late-stage clinical development, and receiving marketing approval from the FDA and subsequently being commercialized, at which point the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits would become more substantial. 
In-license Agreements
We have in-licensed antibodies, targets and enabling technologies from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs and ADC technology, including the following: 

• | Bristol-Myers Squibb License. In 1998, we obtained rights to some of our technologies and product candidates, portions of which are exclusive, through a license agreement with BMS. Through this license, we secured rights to use various targeting technologies. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, which incorporate various technologies owned by BMS. The term of the license agreement expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering the applicable product within that country or either ten or twelve years depending on the particular patents applicable to the product after the first commercial sale of the applicable product within that country. We and BMS each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure and dispute resolution provisions. In addition, the license agreement will terminate automatically in the event that we fail to maintain certain required insurance.


• | University of Miami License. In 1999, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami, Florida, covering an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody that is the basis for the antibody component of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of this license, we made an upfront payment and progress-dependent milestone payments. We are required to pay annual maintenance fees and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, incorporating technology licensed from the University of Miami. The term of the license agreement expires ten years after the first commercial sale of ADCETRIS or on August 21, 2021, upon which we will have in perpetuity a fully paid-up, royalty free, nonexclusive, sublicensable license. We and the University of Miami each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure provisions.


• | Array BioPharma, Inc. We are a party to a license agreement with Array BioPharma, Inc. or Array, which was acquired by Pfizer in July 2019. Pursuant to the license agreement, Array has granted us an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tucatinib. We will pay Array a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing tucatinib rights. Array is also entitled to receive a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of tucatinib by us and a single-digit royalty based on net sales of tucatinib by our sublicensees. The term of the license agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering tucatinib within that country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of tucatinib within that country. We and Array each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure and dispute resolution provisions.


• | Other Licenses. We have other non-exclusive licenses to other technology used in ADCETRIS that require us to pay a low single-digit royalty on net sales of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of in-license agreements related to

our pipeline programs, we would potentially owe development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones, and royalties on net sales of certain approved products. 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to ADCETRIS, PADCEV, our product candidates, monoclonal antibodies, our ADC and SEA technologies and other antibody-based and/or enabling technologies. We commonly seek patent claims directed to compositions of matter, including antibodies, ADCs, and drug-linkers containing highly potent cell-killing agents, as well as methods of using such compositions. When appropriate, we also seek claims to related technologies, such as methods of using certain sugar analogs utilized in our SEA technology. For each of our products and product candidates, we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications. We maintain patents and prosecute applications worldwide for technologies that we have out-licensed, such as our ADC technology. Similarly, for partnered products and product candidates, such as ADCETRIS, PADCEV and tisotumab vedotin, we seek to work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts, including patent application filings, prosecution, term extension, defense and enforcement. As ADCETRIS, PADCEV and our product candidates advance through research and development, we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions, such as combination therapies, improvements to methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment. We also work closely with our scientific personnel to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our development pipeline.
We own or have rights to the following patents relating to our products and our pipeline (in addition to certain patents covering our early-stage product candidates):

• | For ADCETRIS and our related ADC technology, we own twelve patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2031.


• | For PADCEV and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to twelve patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2031. Of these patents, we own or co-own ten patents and have licensed rights to two patents.


• | For tucatinib, we have licensed rights to eight patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2033.


• | For tisotumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to ten patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2032. Of these patents, we own or co-own five patents and have licensed rights to five patents.


• | For ladiratuzumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2032. Of these patents, we own or co-own seven patents and have licensed rights to two patents.

The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. The list above does not identify all patents that may be related to our products and product candidates. For example, in addition to the listed patents, we have patents on platform technologies (that relate to certain general classes of products or methods), as well as patents that relate to methods of using, manufacturing or administering a product or product candidate, that may confer additional patent protection. We also have pending patent applications that may give rise to new patents related to one or more of these agents.
The information in the above list is based on our current assessment of patents that we own, co-own or control or have licensed. The information is subject to revision, for example, in the event of changes in the law or legal rulings affecting our patents or if we become aware of new information. Significant legal issues remain unresolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the U.S. and other important markets outside the U.S. We expect that litigation will likely be necessary to determine the term, validity, enforceability, and/or scope of certain of our patents and other proprietary rights. An adverse decision or ruling with respect to one or more of our patents could result in the loss of patent protection for a product and, in turn, the introduction of competitor products or follow-on biologics to the market earlier than anticipated, and could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using a technology or commercializing a product.
Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of the corresponding patent application(s), the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and requirements for terminal disclaimers. Although we believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue. In the event of issuance, the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators. Our or our collaborators’ current patents, or patents that issue on pending applications, may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, changes to patent laws in the United States or in other countries may limit our ability to defend or enforce our patents, or may apply retroactively to affect the term and/or scope of our patents. Our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post-issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid, not infringed or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law and administrative tribunals, such as in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceedings, foreign opposition proceedings or related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings or litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. Our and our collaborators’ patents may also be circumvented, which may allow third parties to use similar technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. 
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned or licensed to us or to our collaborators. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their validity or enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS or PADCEV or to commercialize our product candidates. Our challenges to patents of other organizations may not be successful, which may affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS, PADCEV or our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our or our collaborators’ ability to make, use or sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV or any other products or product candidates.
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Our agreements with collaborators require them to have a similar policy and agreements with their employees, consultants and advisors. Our policy and agreements and those of our collaborators may not sufficiently protect our confidential information, or third parties may independently develop equivalent information.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, pricing, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries.
Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include: 

• | preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, some of which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated periodically as new information is obtained and at least annually with a report on development;


• | development of a drug formulation and manufacture of the drug for clinical trials, and commercial sale, if approved;


• | completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA which must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless the fee is waived;


• | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites and/or trial sponsors for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, compliance; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA, which includes the product prescribing information, prior to any commercial sale.

The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, and a clinical protocol are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. New clinical trial protocols can be submitted to the existing IND during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually-identifiable information.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product candidate is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and efficacy in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial 
at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA, in the form of a BLA or NDA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA and other regulatory agencies may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA may also convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committee’s recommendation. The submission of a BLA or NDA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDA’s review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of an original application, while priority review is eight months from submission of an original application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval from the FDA upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials. Once an approval is issued, the FDA may require safety-related labeling changes or withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing of an approved product, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of the approved product, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of the approved product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA or NDA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe products for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote products for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
ADCETRIS and certain of our product candidates may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of a reproducible, validated diagnostic test to be used with our therapeutic product at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA’s premarket approval, or PMA, process is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of any future commercial approvals for ADCETRIS, PADCEV or our product candidates. Human diagnostic products are subject to pervasive and ongoing regulatory obligations, including the submission of medical device reports, adherence to the Quality Systems Regulation, recordkeeping and product labeling, as enforced by the FDA and comparable state authorities. 
The FDA's approval of ADCETRIS in the frontline PTCL indication included a post-marketing commitment to develop a clinically validated in-vitro diagnostic device for the selection of patients with CD30-expressing PTCL, not including sALCL, for treatment with ADCETRIS in this indication. We and Takeda have a collaboration with Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., or Ventana, under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to measure CD30 expression levels in tissue specimens. If Ventana develops an in-vitro diagnostic device that we are able to clinically validate, the FDA or another regulatory authority may revise our label for the frontline PTCL indication or in connection with any future approvals to require the use of the in-vitro test as a companion diagnostic. This may limit our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS in the applicable treatment setting due to potential label requirements, prescriber practices, constraints on availability of the diagnostic, or other factors. If Ventana is unable to successfully develop the CD30 in-vitro diagnostic, or experiences delays in doing so, or we experience delays in clinical validation of the diagnostic, we will likely need to renegotiate the timing or content of our post-marketing commitment regarding the in-vitro diagnostic device with the FDA.
Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our collaborators are and will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution and commercial sales of our products. We must obtain approval by the regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We hold worldwide rights to develop and commercialize tucatinib, including in Europe. To commercialize tucatinib in Europe, we will need to comply with applicable European regulations.
Clinical Trials Regulation in Europe
In the EU, pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will come into effect sometime after 2020 with a three-year transition period. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Marketing Authorization Regulation in Europe
In order to be able to market our products outside of the U.S., we must obtain approval from the national competent regulatory authority. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. 
In the European Economic Area, which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization through either of the following procedures: centralized and decentralized. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which then makes a recommendation to the European Commission, or EC. The EC makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The centralized procedure is compulsory for the approval, among others, of human medicines containing a new active substance to treat cancer. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the marketing authorization is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member states (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national marketing authorization in all the member states (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
For the EMA, an application designated as standard review typically lasts approximately twelve to fourteen months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. The accelerated assessment procedure is applicable to marketing authorization applications for medicinal products that are expected to be of major public health interest. For applications that receive accelerated assessment designation and are able to remain on this timeline the review typically lasts approximately seven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. It is not unusual, however, for applications that receive accelerated assessment designation to revert to standard review, typically because the EMA has determined that the significance of the questions that the company needs to address would be more appropriate under the standard review timelines. At the end of the review period, EMA will issue an opinion either in support of marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
Manufacturing Regulation in Europe
Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. The manufacturing of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU member states. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
Post-approval Regulation in Europe
In connection with potential regulatory approvals outside of the U.S., we expect to be subject to a variety of post-authorization regulations, including with respect to clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and safety reporting. 
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation, which includes requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The EMA reviews periodic safety update reports submitted by marketing authorization holders. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has changed, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be amended. The agency can also require that the marketing authorization holder conducts post-authorization safety studies. Non-compliance with such obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
Healthcare Regulation
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws and regulations, may also be applicable to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to or approval by the federal government, including the Medicare, and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis.
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws and regulations that may be broader in scope than the aforementioned federal versions and apply regardless of payor, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, our business operations in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada and the European Union, may subject us to additional regulation. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU member states’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU member states may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our future products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals. There are data privacy and security laws, to which we are currently and/or may in the future, be subject. For example, European Union, or EU, member states and other foreign jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, effective May 25, 2018, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of ADCETRIS, PADCEV and any future products depend, in significant part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatment for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Pharmaceutical products are typically reimbursed based on FDA labeled indications, recognized compendia listings, available medical literature, evidence of favorable clinical outcomes, determination of medical necessity and cost effectiveness.
Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates is individual to each insurer, can vary based on provider contract, and will be affected by state and federal laws providing for reimbursement formulas based on acquisition cost. Third-party payors continue to work diligently to control their spending on prescription drugs and medical service. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the U.S. government and abroad, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and negatively impact our operating results. Payors, commercial and public in the U.S. and abroad, must review the therapeutics value of our products before extending coverage under their plans to reimburse our products. If third-party payors do not find a product to be of therapeutic value, they may not cover it or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Many of the patients in the U.S. who seek treatment with ADCETRIS or PADCEV may be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under these programs are subject to changes in CMS regulations and interpretive policy determinations, in addition to statutory changes made by Congress. For example, PPACA increased the mandated Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. In January 2017, the White House Office of Management and Budget withdrew the draft August 2015 Omnibus Guidance document that was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, that addressed a broad range of topics including, among other items, the definition of a patient’s eligibility for 340B drug pricing. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. In addition, as a condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid, we are required to participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. The rebate amount under this program varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data we report to CMS. In addition, because we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we must make ADCETRIS and PADCEV available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration. This requires compliance with additional laws and requirements, including offering ADCETRIS and PADCEV at a reduced price to federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. We are also required to offer discounted pricing to certain eligible not for profit entities that are eligible for 340B pricing under the Public Health Services Act. Participation in these programs requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, as well as, administrative burdens and exclusion from or contract termination regarding these programs. The terms of these government programs could change in the future which may increase the discounts or rebates we are required to offer, possibly reducing the revenue derived from sales of ADCETRIS and PADCEV to these entities.
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the EU and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national price regimes create price differentials within the EU that can lead to parallel trade in pharmaceutical products.
Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products, as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The EU member states were required to implement the provisions of the Directive into their national legislation by October 2013. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
Healthcare Reform
PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA aims to, among other things, expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, PPACA has, among other things, expanded and increased industry rebates for products covered under Medicaid programs and changed the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program.
Many provisions of PPACA impact the biopharmaceutical industry, including that in order for a biopharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS. The required PHS discount on a given product is calculated based on the Average Manufacturers Price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as PHS drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions, including the AMP rule, to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required PHS discount to increase.
There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it was widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. While Congress has not passed repeal or replace legislation, the tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Based on the repeal of the individual mandate, in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of PPACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace PPACA will impact PPACA and our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Further, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others. This legislation also requires covered manufacturers to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Additionally, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act included provisions requiring that the transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers be done electronically. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act also requires covered manufacturers to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, covered manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation such as measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, on October 30, 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the potential adaption of an international pricing index model that would be designed to reduce Medicare expenditures on certain Part B drugs to rates that are more closely aligned with the costs of such drugs in select comparator countries. In addition, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. However, we anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We also expect ongoing legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation; however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of our products or any future approved products.
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to treating cancer. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.
With respect to ADCETRIS, there are several other FDA approved drugs for its approved indications. BMS’s nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) are approved for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Celgene’s romidepsin (Istodax®) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals’ pralatrexate (Folotyn®) and belinostat (Beleodaq®) are approved for relapsed or refractory sALCL among other T-cell lymphomas. Kyowa Kirin's mogamulizumab (Poteligeo®) is approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. The competition ADCETRIS faces from these and other therapies is intensifying. Additionally, Merck is conducting a phase 3 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing pembrolizumab with ADCETRIS. If this clinical trial demonstrates that pembrolizumab is more effective than ADCETRIS in that treatment setting, our sales of ADCETRIS would be negatively impacted. We are also aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied, including Pfizer’s avelumab, which, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Data have also been presented on several developing technologies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR modified T-cell therapies that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS’ approved indications, including auto-HSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single-agent regimens.
With respect to PADCEV, other treatments in pre-treated metastatic urothelial cancer include checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, generic chemotherapy and, for patients with select fibroblast growth factor receptor genetic alterations, Janssen's erdafitinib (Balversa®). There are other investigational agents that, if approved, could be competitive with PADCEV, such as Immunomedics’ sacituzumab govitecan. Treatment in front line metastatic urothelial cancer has traditionally been treated with chemotherapy alone but is evolving to include two recently approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression or patients who are ineligible for platinum therapy. Several trials of investigational agents in combination with chemotherapy or other novel agents expected to report data in the near term.
With respect to tucatinib, there are multiple marketed products which target HER2, including the antibodies trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and pertuzumab (Perjeta®) and the antibody drug conjugate T-DM1 (Kadcyla®). In addition, lapatinib (Tykerb®) is an EGFR/HER2 oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and neratinib (Nerlynx®) is an irreversible pan-HER kinase inhibitor indicated for extended adjuvant use that is also being studied in a phase 3 trial in pre-treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, for which positive data were reported in 2019. Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu®) that was recently approved for patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Synthon has an antibody drug conjugate in a pivotal study in this patient population and MacroGenics has a HER2 targeted, Fc-optimized antibody, margetuximab, also in a pivotal study for which positive data were reported and a BLA was submitted in late 2019. 
With respect to tisotumab vedotin, in June 2018, Merck’s pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. We are also aware of other companies that currently have products in development for the treatment of late-stage cervical cancer which could be competitive with tisotumab vedotin, including Agenus, BMS, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Merck, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Roche. 
Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Affimed, Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Biogen, BMS, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Infinity, Janssen, Karyopharm, MacroGenics, MedImmune, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Puma Biotech, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing. 
We are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Astellas, AstraZeneca, BMS, Daiichi Sankyo, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, MedImmune, Mersana, Pfizer and Roche, all of which have ADC technology. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGen’s technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis, Takeda and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates.
In addition, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar” or “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDA’s prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application twelve years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The twelve-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the twelve-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDA’s prior approvals in approving a BLA for an innovator’s biological product to support the biosimilar product’s approval. Further, under the FDA’s current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. In the European Union, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products. 
It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than ADCETRIS, PADCEV, tucatinib, tisotumab vedotin, or our other product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, or will succeed in developing biosimilar, interchangeable or generic products for ADCETRIS, PADCEV, tucatinib, tisotumab vedotin or our other product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact potential future sales of ADCETRIS, PADCEV, tucatinib, tisotumab vedotin, or our other product candidates.
With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to:

• | advance our technology platforms;


• | license additional technology;


• | complete clinical trials which position our products for regulatory and commercial success;


• | maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products;


• | obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis;


• | attract and retain key personnel;


• | commercialize effectively;


• | obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;


• | comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and


• | enter into additional collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.

Manufacturing
ADCETRIS
We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to supply ADCETRIS for our clinical trials and for commercial sale. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Millipore Sigma, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing ADCETRIS drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to supply the raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS, and to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including storage and distribution of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, store and distribute sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. 
AbbVie Biotechnology. In 2004, we entered into a development and supply agreement with AbbVie (formerly a part of Abbott Laboratories) to manufacture developmental, clinical and commercial quantities of anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, which is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by AbbVie and the purchase by us of such anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2025 with an automatic one-year term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder.
Millipore Sigma. In 2010, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, which was subsequently acquired by Millipore Sigma, an affiliate of Merck KGaA. Under this agreement, Millipore Sigma manufactures commercial quantities of the drug linker that is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by Millipore Sigma and the purchase by us of drug linker. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required drug linker from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The drug linker is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2029 with automatic term extension unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
PADCEV
We rely on Astellas to supply PADCEV for commercial sale and for our clinical trials, and Astellas oversees the manufacturing supply chain for PADCEV. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on Astellas and other third parties to produce, store and distribute sufficient quantities of PADCEV for commercial sale and for use in our clinical trials. We believe that the existing supplies of PADCEV and Astellas' contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate current commercial and clinical needs. However, we or Astellas may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase manufacturing capability to meet potential future commercial needs with respect to PADCEV, which could require additional capital investment by us or cause us potential delays if Astellas encounters challenges in negotiating commercially reasonable arrangements with these manufacturers. 
Product Candidates
For the clinical supply of our product candidates, which include ADCs as well as antibodies and small molecules such as tucatinib, we rely on multiple contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform manufacturing services for us. In 2017, we acquired a biologics manufacturing facility located in Bothell, Washington. We use the facility to support our clinical supply needs. However, for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and, in the case of tisotumab vedotin, our collaborators for much of the manufacturing to supply drug product for our clinical trials. With respect to tucatinib, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce drug supply for our clinical trials and our potential future commercial supplies. We have limited prior experience as an organization manufacturing tucatinib and small molecule drug products generally, and have relatively new working relationships with many of the third party manufacturers involved in tucatinib manufacture. We may also need to put in place additional manufacturing arrangements or expand our current manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers to meet potential future commercial needs for tucatinib, and while we are currently negotiating those arrangements, we cannot assure you that we can enter into such arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. With respect to tisotumab vedotin, the manufacturing supply chain is overseen by Genmab, and we rely Genmab to supply sufficient supplies of drug product. For tisotumab vedotin, we believe that the existing supplies of drug product and Genmab's contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate ongoing and future clinical trials. However, we or Genmab may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase manufacturing capability to meet potential future commercial needs with respect to tisotumab vedotin, which could require additional capital investment by us or cause us potential delays if Genmab encounters challenges in negotiating commercially reasonable arrangements with these manufacturers. 
Commercial Operations
We have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to commercialize ADCETRIS in the U.S. and Canada, and PADCEV in the U.S. We believe the U.S. market for ADCETRIS and PADCEV in their approved indications, and Canadian market for ADCETRIS in its approved indications, are addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, and we intend to continue promoting our products in the U.S. and Canada for these and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. Takeda has commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. We and Takeda have received marketing authorizations by regulatory authorities for ADCETRIS in more than 70 countries worldwide, and Takeda continues to pursue marketing authorizations in multiple other countries.
We sell ADCETRIS and PADCEV through a limited number of specialty distributors. Health care providers order ADCETRIS and PADCEV through these distributors. We receive orders from distributors and generally ship product directly to the health care provider. Three of our major distributors, together with entities under their common control—AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation—each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,605 employees. Of these employees, 1,011 were engaged in or support research, development and clinical activities, 309 were in administrative and business related positions, and 285 were in sales and marketing. Each of our employees has signed confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
