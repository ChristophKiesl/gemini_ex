Industry Background
 
DSP Cores
 
Digital signal processing is a key underlying technology in many of today's fastest growing electronics markets. Digital signal processors (DSPs) are specialized high-speed processors that are optimized for performing repetitive arithmetic calculations on an array of data. DSPs provide the foundation for a vast majority of today's electronic products that are smart and connected, enabling the sensing and wireless communications capabilities (e.g. 5G baseband and RAN processing, computer vision, deep neural network, sound processing and analytics).

Edge AI Hybrid Processors
 
Edge AI Hybrid processors are a new breed of processors targeted at cost- and power-sensitive intelligent devices that use interchangeable workloads of traditional DSP and AI inferencing algorithms to enable intelligent vision, conversational AI, sensor fusion and contextual awareness. The DSP is used to process conventional algorithms for imaging, vision, voice, sound, radar, among others, while the AI-related workloads such as classification, pattern matching, prediction and detection are handled by a combination of DSPs and AI accelerators. These edge AI hybrid processors perform all AI inferencing on the device, with no need for cloud-based processing. These processors aim to mimic the human brain, allowing them to perform cognitive tasks for a wide range of functions, including vision, sound, real-time translation, user behavior and malware detection. Edge AI processors will make their way into billions of devices in the coming years, including mobile, consumer, medical, industrial and automotive applications.
Short Range Wireless IPs
 
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy and dual mode are key technologies for any company looking to address the Internet-of-Things (“IoT”). Moreover, many companies wish to integrate these connectivity technologies into SoC designs rather than provide connectivity through an additional chip in the system. Yet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards are constantly evolving, and the many new end applications are looking to benefit from these enhancements, which put further pressure on time to market on SoC vendors. The advent of IoT has resulted in significant demand for connectivity IPs that addresses this burgeoning market, among which are smart True Wireless Stereo earbuds, sport trackers, smart watches, smart speakers, and many other consumer and IoT devices. By licensing rather than developing these technologies in-house, companies can now get access to the latest standards and profiles from CEVA without undertaking the expensive research and development costs required to develop these technologies internally.
 
Cellular IoT IPs
 
Cellular IoT, and specifically Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and Cat-1, are becoming key technologies for any company wishing to connect low power IoT devices over long distances, using cellular networks. By its nature, cellular is a very complex technology, with most of the industry knowledge held within a few large companies. By providing a licensable NB-IoT solution and low power DSP cores, we help companies overcome the entry barriers to the cellular IoT market without undertaking the complex and expensive R&D to develop these technologies internally.
 
Sensor Fusion
 
MEMS-based inertial and environmental sensors are used in an increasing number of devices, including smartphones, laptops, robots, TWS earbuds, smartTVs, remote controls, AR and VR headsets, drones and many other consumer and industrial devices. The software required to process the sensor data and fuse the data from multiple sensors is complex and requires unique specialization. By licensing rather than developing this sensor processing software in-house, companies can focus their efforts developing the applications that utilize the processed sensor data to create differentiated, contextually aware devices.
Design Gap
 
The demand for connected and smart mobile, consumer, automotive, industrial and IoT devices continues to grow. These devices require faster and low power connectivity, and a richer user experience that is aware and predictive. Semiconductor manufacturers face ever growing pressures to make smaller, feature-rich integrated circuits that are more reliable, less expensive and have greater performance. These two trends are occurring concurrently in the face of decreasing product lifecycles and constrained battery power. The advent of wireless connectivity technologies like 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 and the diverse sensor related workloads required to make a device smart, such as advanced image enhancement, computer vision, AI inferencing, voice and audio pre- and post- processing and motion sensor fusion have further increased these pressures. While semiconductor manufacturing processes have advanced significantly to allow a substantial increase in the number of circuits placed on a single chip, resources for design capabilities have not kept pace with the advances in manufacturing processes, resulting in a growing “design gap” between the increasing manufacturing potential and the constrained design capabilities.

CEVA’s Business
 
CEVA addresses the requirements of the mobile, consumer, automotive, robotics, industrial and IoT markets by designing and licensing a broad range of robust processors, platforms and software which streamline the design of solutions for developing a wide variety of application specific solutions that combine connectivity and smart sensing that involve primarily camera, microphone and IMU.
 
Given the “design gap,” as well as the increasing complexity and the unique skill set required to develop a system-on-chip, many semiconductor design and manufacturing companies increasingly choose to license proven intellectual property, such as processor cores (e.g. DSP, CPU, GPU and AI), specialized connectivity software algorithms like sensor fusion, sound, memory and physical IPs from silicon intellectual property (SIP) companies like CEVA rather than develop those technologies in-house. In addition, with more complex designs and shorter time to market, it is no longer cost efficient and becoming progressively more difficult for most semiconductor companies to develop the signal processing platform, incorporating the complex DSPs like scalar, vector, AI accelerators and related graph compiler, data connectivity modem and phy platforms. As a result, companies increasingly seek to license these IPs from CEVA or a third-party community of developers.
 
Our IP Business Model
 
Our objective is for our CEVA wireless connectivity and smart sensing platforms to become the de facto technologies across the mobile, consumer, automotive, robotics, industrial and IoT markets. To enable this goal, we license our technologies on a worldwide basis to semiconductor and OEM companies that design and manufacture products that combine CEVA-based solutions with their own differentiating technology. We believe our business model offers us some key advantages. By not focusing on manufacturing or selling silicon products, we are free to widely license our technology and free to focus most of our resources on research and development. By choosing to license our IP, manufacturers can achieve the advantage of creating their own differentiated solutions and develop their own unique product roadmaps. Through our licensing efforts, we have established a worldwide community developing CEVA-based solutions, and therefore we can leverage their strengths, customer relationships, proprietary technology advantages, and existing sales and marketing infrastructure. In addition, as our intellectual property is widely licensed and deployed, system OEM companies can obtain CEVA-based chipsets from a wide range of suppliers, thus reducing dependence on any one supplier and fostering price competition, both of which help to contain the cost of CEVA-based products.
 
We operate a licensing and royalty business model. We typically charge a license fee for access to our hardware technology and a royalty fee for each unit of silicon which incorporates our hardware or software technology. License fees are invoiced in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms. Royalties are reported and invoiced quarterly and generally based on a fixed unit rate or a percentage of the sale price for the CEVA-based silicon product.
 
Strategy
 
We believe there is a growing demand for high performance and low power signal processing IPs and specialized AI platforms and software incorporating all the necessary hardware and software for target applications. Our IP portfolio is strategically aligned to allow us to exploit the most lucrative “design gaps” in the growing demand for smarter, connected devices. As CEVA offers expertise developing complete solutions in a number of key growth markets, including, 5G cellular baseband, wireless wearables, robots, automotive and IoT. For these markets, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of connectivity and smart sensing, which include various types of specialized DSPs and platforms for 5G, computer vision, sound, AI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NB-IoT solutions, sensor fusion and sound.

This involvement allows us to influence the development of new standards; keeps us informed as to important new developments regarding standards; and allows us to demonstrate our expertise to existing and potential customers who also participate in these standards-setting bodies.
 
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. They are subject to rapid change and are significantly affected by new product introductions. We compete with other suppliers of licensed signal processing IPs. We believe that the principal competitive elements in our field are signal processing IP performance, overall chip cost, power consumption, flexibility, reliability, communication and multimedia software and algorithms availability, design cycle time, tool chain, customer support, financial strength, name recognition and reputation. We believe that we compete effectively in each of these areas, but can offer no assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, and marketing or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future.
 
The markets in which we compete are dominated by large, highly competent semiconductor companies that have significant brand recognition, a large installed base and a large network of support and field application engineers. We face direct and indirect competition from:
 

● | IP vendors that offer programmable or configurable DSP cores;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | IP vendors that offer vision processing units for computer vision applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IP vendors that offer neural network processing units for AI applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IP vendors that offer voice software packages, including beamforming, direction of arrival and echo cancellation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IP vendors that offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity IPs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | IP vendors that offer hardware-based DSP implementation as opposed to software-based DSP, which is our specialization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | internal design groups of large chip companies or OEMs that develop proprietary signal processing IP cores or engines for their own application-specific chipsets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | internal design groups of large chip companies or OEMs that develop proprietary sensor processing and sensor fusion software for sale as part of a chip or for their own application-specific chipsets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We face direct competition in the DSP and configurable core space mainly from Verisilicon, Cadence and Synopsys, which licenses DSP cores in addition to their respective semiconductor and EDA businesses. In AI processors, we face direct competition from EDA players in addition to a host of companies offering AI cores and accelerators such as ARM, (acquired by SoftBank), AImotive, Digital Media Professionals, (DMP), Imagination Technologies (acquired by Canyon Bridge). In the short-range wireless space, we face direct competition from Mindtree.
 
    10 

  

In recent years, we also have faced competition from companies that offer Central Processor Unit (CPU) intellectual property. These companies’ products are used for host functions in various applications, such as in mobile and home entertainment products. These applications typically also incorporate a programmable DSP or neural network accelerator that is responsible for communication and video/audio/voice-related tasks, neural network or in some cases connectivity capabilities. CPU companies, such as ARM, Cadence, and Synopsys have added DSP acceleration, CNN acceleration and /or connectivity solutions and make use of it to provide platform solutions in the areas of baseband, video, imaging, vision, AI, audio and connectivity.
 
With respect to certain large potential customers, we also compete with internal engineering teams, which may design programmable signal processing IP core products in-house. Companies such as Mediatek, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei and STMicroelectronics license our designs for some applications and use their own proprietary cores for other applications. These companies also may choose to license their proprietary signal processing IP cores to third parties and, as a result, become direct competitors.
 
Aside from the in-house research and development groups, we do not compete with any individual company across the range of our market offerings. Within particular market segments, however, we do face competition to a greater or lesser extent from other industry participants. For example, in the following specific areas we compete with the companies indicated:
 

● | in the digital embedded imaging and vision market –Arm Limited, Synopsys, Cadence and Videantis, as well as GPU IP providers such as Arm Limited, Imagination Technologies and Verisilicon; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in audio and voice applications market – Arm Limited, Cadence, Synopsys and Verisilicon.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proprietary Rights
 
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection of our technology. We also seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property and trade secrets by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code and other intellectual property. Due to rapid technological change, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments and enhancements to existing products are more important than specific legal protections of our technology in establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
 
We have an active program to protect our proprietary technology through the filing of patents. Our patents relate to our signal processing IP cores and application-specific platform technologies. As of December 31, 2020, we hold 59 patents in the United States, five patents in Canada, 88 patents in the EME (Europe and Middle East) region and 10 patents in Asia Pacific (APAC) region, totaling 162 patents, with expiration dates between 2021 and 2038. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have two patent applications pending in the United States, two pending patent applications in Canada, six pending patent applications in the EME region and five pending patent applications in the APAC region, totaling 15 pending patent applications.
 
We actively pursue foreign patent protection in countries where we feel it is prudent to do so. Our policy is to apply for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved technology. The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, there are no assurances that any patent application filed by us will result in a patent being issued, or that our issued patents, and any patents that may be issued in the future, will afford us adequate protection against competitors with similar technology; nor can we be assured that patents issued to us will not be infringed or that others will not design around our technology. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We can provide no assurance that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved or will not be challenged by third parties, that any issued patents will effectively protect our technology, or that patents held by third parties will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business.
 
    11 

  

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Questions of infringement in the semiconductor field involve highly technical and subjective analyses. In addition, patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies (so-called patent “trolls”), which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against companies, such as us, for monetary gain. Because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology, the assertion of our own patents by way of counter-claim may be ineffective. Litigation may in the future be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to prevail in any such litigation, or be able to devote the financial resources required to bring such litigation to a successful conclusion.
 
In any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property, our licensees also could become the targets of litigation. We are generally bound to indemnify licensees under the terms of our license agreements. Although our indemnification obligations are generally subject to a maximum amount, these obligations could nevertheless result in substantial expenses. In addition to the time and expense required for us to indemnify our licensees, a licensee’s development, marketing and sale of products embodying our solutions could be severely disrupted or shut down as a result of litigation.
 
We also rely on trademark, copyright and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property. We have registered trademark in the United States for our name CEVA and the related CEVA logo, and currently market our signal processing cores and other technology offerings under this trademark.
