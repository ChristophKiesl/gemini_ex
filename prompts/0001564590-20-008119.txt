Item 1. Business
Overview 
 We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing transformative medicines to treat patients with serious and rare diseases. Our large and advancing pipeline of medicines in late-stage development and medicines on the market allows us to capitalize on our strengths in supporting 
patients, healthcare professionals and caregivers in treating rare and serious diseases.  To optimize the value of our medicines to treat larger patient populations, we add to our own capabilities the strengths of partners to provide additional expertise, resources and commercial capabilities. We believe our strong relationship with our majority shareholder, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, should allow us to continue to expand our pipeline. 
 We have a robust portfolio of antisense medicines on the market and in development covering multiple targets and diseases that we have licensed from Ionis. We are highly focused on commercializing our approved therapies, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. TEGSEDI is indicated to treat adults with the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, and has been approved and launched in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U. and Canada as well as approved in Brazil. WAYLIVRA is indicated as an adjunct to diet to treat adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, for whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. WAYLIVRA has been approved and launched in the E.U.
 We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel medicines with the potential to treat multiple diseases. In addition to TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, our pipeline includes two medicines in Phase 3 clinical trials, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx which is partnered with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We also have two additional medicines that have each completed a Phase 2 study, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, which is partnered with Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. All of our medicines are based on Ionis’ antisense technology platform.  Our medicines in development use Ionis' advanced LIgand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these medicines in particular tissues.
 We are continuing to optimize our current commercial infrastructure for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and plan to use this infrastructure for the other medicines in our pipeline. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address serious and rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases allows us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, we created Akcea Connect, a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients, their caregivers and their families in the U.S. Internationally, we are introducing Akcea Connect in each of the countries where we launch with the highest level of patient and physician support allowed by local regulations. Express Scripts’ Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo is our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Accredo because of their experience with the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and approximately 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass™ in the U.S. and Canada, a free-of-charge, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people suspected to have hATTR amyloidosis. This program is intended to empower patients and their caregivers by providing accurate genetic information, so they can make informed decisions about their healthcare. 
 As we build Akcea, we continue to execute our strategy to provide our medicines to a significant global patient population in an efficient and timely manner. Depending on the geographic region, the number of patients impacted by the diseases we are treating and the regulatory environment of the local countries, we may choose to build out the commercial infrastructure ourselves, or to partner with another company for commercial sales and distribution. For instance, in August 2018, we entered into a licensing agreement with PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC Therapeutics, to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. Our decision to partner with PTC Therapeutics to accelerate commercial access for patients in Latin America reflects our commitment to bringing TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA to patients as rapidly as possible. PTC Therapeutics has an established rare disease team in Latin America that has experience in patient identification, in physician and patient education and support programs and in efficiently obtaining market access. PTC Therapeutics’ patient focused approach for rare diseases aligns with our approach, making them an experienced partner for this region. In October 2019, PTC Therapeutics received approval for TEGSEDI in Brazil.
 PTC Therapeutics anticipates approval in Brazil for WAYLIVRA this year.

To maximize the commercial potential of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we have a strategic collaboration with Novartis. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis is now responsible for all development and commercialization activities for this medicine, subject to our potential participation in co-commercialization. Novartis initiated the Lp(a) HORIZON study, a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with established cardiovascular disease, or CVD, and elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Lp(a) HORIZON is a global CVD outcomes study in which Novartis plans to enroll more than 7,500 patients. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver this potential therapy to the large population of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to elevated Lp(a). As part of our collaboration with Novartis, we have the potential to earn up to $900 million in upfront, license and milestone payments. In February 2017, we received $75.0 million in an upfront payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. We also earned a $150.0 million license fee upon Novartis’ exercise of its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in February 2019, of which we paid $75.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. The $75.0 million sublicense fee due to Ionis was settled by issuing 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis. We are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis and milestone payments of up to $675 million if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to exclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which we may negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying us increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.

Our collaboration with Novartis also included rights to AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In December 2019, Novartis made a strategic portfolio decision not to exercise its option and terminated its rights to AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and, consequently, we have retained the rights to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In January 2020, we reported positive Phase 2 top line results from this program for the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia. That study showed substantial triglyceride reduction, with 90% of patients achieving normal triglyceride levels at the highest dose level,
 and an attractive safety and tolerability profile with patients staying on treatment for up to 12 months. We and Ionis plan to initiate a Phase 3 program in FCS for this medicine in 2020 and we are evaluating additional rare and common diseases that are associated with high triglyceride levels
. AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx also has the potential to favorably impact numerous other risk factors independently associated with CVD.
 
In October 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Pfizer, or the Pfizer Collaboration, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, in which we granted Pfizer exclusive rights to develop and commercialize AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx worldwide. As part of the Pfizer Collaboration, we have the right to participate in commercialization activities with Pfizer in the U.S. and certain additional markets. We believe Pfizer’s expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes it well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, and to deliver it to the potentially large population of patients in need of additional therapies for these life-threatening diseases. Pfizer is responsible for all development and regulatory activities and costs beyond those associated with the Phase 2 study for which we recently announced positive top line results. As part of our collaboration, we received a license fee of $250.0 million in November 2019. We issued 6,873,344 shares of our common stock in December 2019 to Ionis as payment of a $125.0 million sublicense fee related to this license fee. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx from Pfizer and up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments if and when Pfizer meets the development, regulatory and commercialization milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
Our Strategy
 We believe we are on our way to becoming a premier global biopharmaceutical company offering treatments for previously inadequately treated serious and rare diseases. The critical components of our business strategy to achieve this goal include the following:

• | Successfully commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. We are currently commercializing TEGSEDI in the U.S., E.U. and Canada, and WAYLIVRA in the E.U. We have built commercial organizations in those regions and continue to determine the optimal method to provide access to our medicines beyond the regions in which we have a physical presence through expansion of our own footprint and partnerships with companies with regional strength. Our goal is to embrace strategies that allow our medicines to be made available to patients in need as broadly as possible. We are providing high touch patient and healthcare provider support through Akcea Connect. This team of dedicated nurse case managers provide reimbursement assistance, injection training and support for routine platelet monitoring, which we

believe enables strong integration with treating physicians and should facilitate patient uptake and compliance. We also have partnered with PTC Therapeutics to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain countries in the Caribbean. We believe our collaboration with PTC Therapeutics is the best way to provide these medicines to patients quickly in these markets. We also believe PTC Therapeutics shares the same patient focus that we do and will be able to provide the same patient services as appropriate in Latin American and certain Caribbean countries. We will continue to assess expanding and optimizing our own global footprint as well as additional strategic partnerships as we continue to commercialize both medicines.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance multiple novel clinical-stage medicines to commercialization and further grow our pipeline. We seek to maximize near-term and long-term commercial opportunities through development paths in both rare and broader patient populations. Our pipeline of antisense medicines currently contains four clinical-stage novel therapies, for each of which we have completed a Phase 2 study, that we plan to develop and commercialize by ourselves or in conjunction with a partner for multiple indications. To attain our goal of being a premier rare and serious disease company, we also plan to actively replenish our pipeline as our current medicines advance through development. For example, we will have the opportunity to potentially license antisense medicines that Ionis advances to treat rare cardiometabolic and rare inherited metabolic diseases under our right of first negotiation that Ionis granted us. Ionis also recently committed to potentially licensing additional medicines from its pipeline to us, and we are currently in discussions with Ionis regarding potentially in-licensing a product that complements our rare disease expertise. In addition to antisense technology, we are open to other technologies and products that could benefit from our commercial and development expertise in rare diseases and we are actively evaluating third party products that we believe could be attractive additions to our serious and rare disease business.

• | Create value through strategic collaborations, to drive medicines to their fullest potential. We believe that some of our medicines could address diseases with very large patient populations, who are managed by both large numbers and diverse specialties of treating physicians. In these patient populations, large, costly, late-stage clinical development programs, as well as large sales forces, are required to achieve sufficiently broad reach across the many relevant stakeholder groups and to maximize a medicine's commercial potential. As a result, in some cases, the expertise and resources of a large partner organization with global scale adding to our skills and expertise may be the optimal approach for maximizing the potential of medicines in these large indications. As an example, we have a strategic collaboration with Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. As of February 2019, upon Novartis’ exercise of its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Novartis is responsible for all future clinical development and commercial activities and costs of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis has initiated a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. The patient population that is the focus of the study - patients with cardiovascular disease due to high Lp(a) - is potentially very large. Additionally, in October 2019, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Pfizer for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx which also has the potential treat very large populations of patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We believe Novartis and Pfizer bring significant resources and expertise that can accelerate our ability to develop, commercialize and deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have certain cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. We may expand our collaborations with existing or establish new collaborations with additional pharmaceutical partners with global scale to maximize the potential of our exclusively licensed medicines in both rare and broad indications in certain markets.

MARKETED THERAPIES
 TEGSEDI
 TEGSEDI is designed to reduce the production of transthyretin, or TTR, protein. TEGSEDI is now approved in the U.S., E.U., Canada and Brazil. 
 On October 5, 2018, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for TEGSEDI for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. On October 3, 2018, TEGSEDI was approved by Health Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. On July 11, 2018, TEGSEDI received marketing authorization, or MA, approval from the European Commission, or EC, for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. TEGSEDI was also approved by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, ANVISA, for the treatment of stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR, to delay disease progression and improve quality of life. It is being marketed in Brazil by PTC Therapeutics. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. TEGSEDI is commercially available in over ten countries, and we continue to work toward the ultimate goal of making it available to patients globally. TEGSEDI is a medicine that Ionis discovered and developed using Ionis’ proprietary antisense technology platform.

Disease Background 
 hATTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive and life-threatening disease caused by the abnormal formation of the TTR protein and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including in peripheral nerves, the heart and intestinal tract. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these organs often leads to intractable peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy, as well as other disease manifestations. hATTR amyloidosis causes significant morbidity and progressive decline in quality of life, severely impacting activities of daily living. The disease often progresses rapidly and can lead to premature death. The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis. 
WAYLIVRA
 WAYLIVRA is designed to address the serious and unmet medical needs of the underserved FCS patient community. WAYLIVRA was granted conditional marketing authorization approval in the E.U. from the EC on May 3, 2019. WAYLIVRA is indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.  WAYLIVRA is a medicine that Ionis discovered and is being co-developed by Ionis and Akcea. WAYLIVRA uses Ionis’ proprietary antisense technology platform. 
 We are focused on the 
commercial launch for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. WAYLIVRA was launched in Germany in August 2019 and we plan to launch in additional countries in the E.U.  in 2020. We are leveraging and optimizing our existing commercial infrastructure in Europe to market WAYLIVRA. In the U.S., on May 10, 2018, the FDA’s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to support approval of WAYLIVRA for the treatment of people with FCS. On August 27, 2018, we and Ionis announced that we received a Complete Response Letter from the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products of the FDA regarding the New Drug Application for WAYLIVRA. The FDA did not cite any new concerns beyond those described in the Advisory Committee briefing book, in which the main areas of focus were the dosing schedule and management of thrombocytopenia, a deficiency of platelets in the blood. In November 2018, we received a Notice of Noncompliance withdrawal letter, or NON-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA. We and Ionis are engaged in finding a path forward for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and in Canada. 
 FCS is a serious and rare disease caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, and characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and a risk of acute pancreatitis. Further, the lives of patients with this disease are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our Phase 3 clinical study, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. The final study results from the Phase 3 APPROACH study were published in the August 8th, 2019 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the WAYLIVRA program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. The FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted orphan drug designation to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FCS.
 In August 2019, we announced topline results from the BROADEN study in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. People with FPL have abnormal subcutaneous fat distribution causing increased incidence of potentially life-threatening pancreatitis, diabetes, extreme insulin resistance and increased liver fat. BROADEN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 300 mg of WAYLIVRA administered by a subcutaneous injection in patients with FPL. In the study, WAYLIVRA met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in triglyceride levels. WAYLIVRA also met a key secondary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in liver fat. The most common adverse events observed in WAYLIVRA-treated patients were mild or moderate in severity and included injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and reductions in platelet levels. We are continuing to evaluate the data from this study and are assessing next steps.

PIPELINE
 

All products were discovered by Ionis and either developed by Ionis or co-developed by Ionis and Akcea. 
 LICA Pipeline
 The other medicines in our pipeline - AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx - utilize Ionis' LICA technology. Ionis’ LICA technology conjugates specific chemical structures or molecules to antisense medicines to increase the efficiency of medicine uptake in a particular tissue. We believe the enhancements from LICA technology have the potential to allow for less frequent administration and significantly lower doses and lower volumes, providing greater patient convenience. Data from a number of Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 studies of the LICA technology have shown that doses up to 30-fold lower than non-LICA medicines resulting in consistent target reductions and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Our current pipeline includes medicines with the potential to treat patients with ATTR and a wide range of lipid disorders associated with cardiometabolic disease that other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies, have not been able to adequately address. 
 Our clinical pipeline contains novel medicines with the potential to treat inadequately addressed serious and rare disorders, as well as disorders affecting large patient populations. 
 AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (also known as TQJ230)
 Novartis is developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a), protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Apo(a) is a form of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, that is very atherogenic (promoting the formation of plaques in the arteries) and very thrombogenic (promoting the formation of blood clots). In September 2018, we reported positive results from the Phase 2 dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) greater than 60 mg/dL, and established CVD. 
 In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis has initiated the Lp(a) HORIZON study, a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, also known as TQJ230, in patients with established CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver this potential therapy to patients at risk of CVD due to elevated levels of Lp(a). If AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is approved, Novartis will be responsible for worldwide commercialization, and we believe that Novartis’ expertise, resources and commercial capability will support broad global reach for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
 Novartis’ decision to exercise its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx followed positive results from a Phase 2 study in patients with established CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). The Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and to determine the appropriate dosing for a planned Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study.  The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 study included 286 patients with established CVD and high Lp(a) levels (baseline mean of approximately 100mg/dL 250 nmol/L - more than three times the upper limit of normal). The trial had five cohorts: 
 8


20 mg (every 4 weeks), 40 mg (every 4 weeks), 60 mg (every 4 weeks), 20 mg (every 2 weeks), and 20 mg (every week). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at the primary analysis time point (6 months) compared to placebo. The secondary efficacy endpoints were mean percent change in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a), and the number of patients reaching pre-specified thresholds of Lp(a) reduction of <125 nmol/L (<50 mg/dL) or <75 nmol/L (<30 mg/dL). Patients were treated with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or placebo for at least six months, with some patients treated as long as up to one year. The study met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed at 6 months. Results from the study show statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels:
 
 
Lp(a) | Pooled placebo (n=47) | 20 mg every 4 weeks (n=48) | 40 mg every 4 weeks (n=48) | 20 mg every 2 weeks (n=48) | 60 mg every 4 weeks (n=47) | 20 mg weekly (n=48)
-------------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------
LSMean % change in Lp(a) | -6 | -35 P=0.0032 | -56 P<0.0001 | -58 P<0.0001 | -72 P<0.0001 | -80 P<0.0001 


* | LSMean: Least squares mean (which is intended to provide a more accurate estimate of the population average, as compared to the simple arithmetic mean, by controlling for a potential imbalance in population characteristics between treatments).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 98% of patients in the 20mg weekly cohort and approximately 81% of patients in the 60mg every 4 week cohort achieved clinically significant reductions in Lp(a) levels bringing them below the recommended threshold of risk for CVD events (<50 mg/dL).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was associated with decreases in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Most adverse events were mild. The most frequent adverse events were injection site reactions, or ISRs. ISRs occurred in 26% of patients and were mostly mild. One patient discontinued due to an ISR.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no safety concerns related to platelet counts, liver function or renal function.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No patient in the study experienced a confirmed platelet count below 100,000/mm3. The incidence of platelet levels below normal (140,000/mm3) was comparable between the active (10.5%) and placebo (14.9%) groups.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Approximately 90% of patients completed treatment and the rate of discontinuation was comparable between the active (12.1%) and placebo (14.9%) groups.
 Disease Background
 Despite the management of LDL-C with statins and other therapies, the incidence of CVD continues to rise dramatically. Lipid disorders are a cause of this continuing rise. Hyperlipoproteinemia(a), defined as levels of Lp(a) above 30mg/dL, which is present in approximately 20% of the general population, is believed to cause CVD.
 Currently, there is no effective medicine to specifically and robustly lower elevated levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. Statins do not have significant effects on Lp(a) levels. Further, we believe the modest reduction (approximately 25%) of Lp(a) by a new class of medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors is unlikely to materially reduce the risk of cardiovascular events related to hyperlipoproteinemia(a). PCSK9 inhibitors inactivate a protein in the plasma that regulates the number of LDL receptors on the liver cell surface, thereby capturing and removing additional LDL particles from the blood. The only currently known effective way to significantly reduce plasma Lp(a) is to physically remove the particles from blood through a process called apheresis. In this process, the patient's blood is filtered through a machine where the LDL-C and Lp(a) particles are removed and the blood is returned to the patient's body. Since 2010, apheresis has been an approved therapy in Germany to treat patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), but it is expensive, time consuming and only performed by a small number of centers worldwide. Lp(a) apheresis has been shown to lower the rate of cardiovascular events, providing support that lowering Lp(a) can provide therapeutic benefit.
 A number of expert groups, including the National Institutes for Health, European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association, and publications have stated that Lp(a) is an independent cause of cardiovascular risk. The authors of three such publications evaluated data from over 180,000 participants and used statistical and genetic approaches to evaluate the correlation between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. The specific techniques the authors used were epidemiological/meta-analyses, Mendelian randomization and genome wide associations. In each technique used, the authors demonstrated a clear relationship between elevated levels of Lp(a) and increased cardiovascular risk.

The graphics below further illustrate these correlations:
 

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 Elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and lowering Lp(a) may reduce the risk. We estimate the eligible population, patients with elevated levels of Lp(a) and prior CVD, to be greater than 8 
million people globally. We believe that positive results from a large cardiovascular outcome study will be required to support marketing authorization for the treatment of these patients. Novartis licensed AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and is conducting, at its expense, such a study pursuant to our strategic collaboration and, if approved, will commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for these patients. As part of the collaboration, we may co-commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in selected markets, on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
 AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx
 Pfizer is developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In October 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Pfizer for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. We believe Pfizer’s expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes it well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. Pfizer is responsible for all development and regulatory activities and all costs beyond those associated with the Phase 2 study, which recently reported positive top line results in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. 
 
As indicated above, in January 2020, we reported positive topline results from the Phase 2 study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in 105 patients with hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. The study met the primary endpoint of significant triglyceride lowering and multiple secondary endpoints with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The objective of the dose-ranging Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The study was multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. Participants were administered AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx or placebo via subcutaneous injection for six months. Weekly and monthly dosing was explored in three cohorts with doses ranging from 40 mg to 80 mg of total monthly dose. Observations from the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx study included:
 
 
• | Statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dose-dependent reductions in ANGPTL3, apoC-III, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C), non-HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to placebo
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No reductions in liver fat or hemoglobin A1C compared to placebo
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The most common adverse event was ISRs, which were mostly mild
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in platelets were similar between placebo and treated groups
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We and Pfizer are discussing the development path for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and Pfizer will determine the strategies for development of this program. Given that we did not see reductions in liver fat or hemoglobin A1c, Pfizer may not pursue development of indications with these endpoints. If AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx is approved, Pfizer will be responsible for worldwide commercialization, and we believe that Pfizer’s expertise, resources and commercial capability will support broad global reach for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. As part of the collaboration, we have the right to participate in certain commercialization activities with Pfizer in the U.S. and certain additional markets on predefined terms and based on meeting predefined criteria.

AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx
 
We and Ionis are co-developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by WAYLIVRA, for the rare and common diseases that are associated with elevated triglyceride levels, and we also believe this medicine has the potential to favorably impact numerous other risk factors independently associated with CVD. We believe that the enhancements offered by Ionis' LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses, lower volumes, less frequent administration and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. 
 
We recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 2 study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. The objective of the Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different doses and dosing frequencies of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study included 114 patients with hypertriglyceridemia who are at risk for or have established CVD. Participants were administered AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx or placebo via subcutaneous injection for at least six months with some patients being treated for as long as up to a year. Weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly dosing was explored in four cohorts with doses ranging from 10 mg to 50 mg total monthly dose. Observations from the AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx study included:
  
• | Statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At the highest once monthly dose, more than 90% of patients achieved serum triglycerides ≤ 150 mg/dL compared to less than 5% of patients in the placebo group; mean triglyceride levels of patients at baseline was 285 mg/dL.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant reductions in multiple secondary endpoints independently associated with cardiovascular risk were observed including apoC-III, VLDL-C, and remnant cholesterol compared to baseline.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Statistically significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C, were observed at all dose levels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were comparable between active and placebo groups. The most common adverse events were ISRs. ISRs were mostly mild, infrequent and primarily occurred in the weekly dose group. In the highest monthly dose group, the occurrence of ISRs was similar to the placebo group.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no safety signals, including those related to platelet counts, liver function or renal function.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 85% of patients completed treatment and the rate of treatment discontinuation was comparable between the active and placebo groups.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With these data, we and Ionis plan to initiate a Phase 3 program in FCS for this medicine in 2020 and we are evaluating development in additional rare and common diseases that are associated with high triglyceride levels. AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx also has the potential to favorably impact numerous other risk factors independently associated with CVD.
 
Disease Background and Commercial Opportunity
 
FCS is an under-recognized disease caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, and characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia (>880mg/dL) and a risk of acute pancreatitis. Because of limited LPL function, people with FCS cannot break down chylomicrons, lipoprotein particles that are 90% triglycerides. FCS, which is estimated to affect 3,000 to 5,000 patients worldwide, can lead to many health issues including chronic pain, fatigue, a milky appearance of retinal veins and arteries, neurological symptoms such as depression and memory loss, swelling of the liver and spleen, and fatty deposits in the skin. FCS is a serious and rare disease with no other approved therapies.

AKCEA-TTR-LRx
 We are co-developing AKCEA-TTR-LRx with Ionis to treat the broad population of patients with both hereditary and wild-type forms of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis.  Based on its profile, we believe AKCEA-TTR-LRx treatment can significantly reduce levels of the TTR protein, which we believe will translate to efficacy in terms of both clinical benefit and quality of life improvements with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. As with other LICA medicines, we believe we can achieve this positive efficacy, safety and tolerability profile with low doses and with the potential for monthly dosing. We and Ionis initiated clinical development of AKCEA-TTR-LRx in December 2018 and presented positive Phase 1 data results in September 2019. Data from this study showed a >90% knockdown of TTR following administration in healthy volunteers, and a positive safety and tolerability profile. We and Ionis recently initiated a Phase 3 program which consists of two studies of AKCEA-TTR-LRx. The CARDIO-TTRansform study is in patients with both wild type and hereditary forms of TTR-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathy. The NEURO-TTRansform study is in patients with polyneuropathy driven by hATTR amyloidosis.
 Disease Background 
 Transthyretin-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, is a progressive, irreversible, and debilitating disease. ATTR-CM is the result of TTR misfolding into clusters called amyloid deposits. These amyloid deposits build up in the cardiac muscle, causing debilitating heart damage and resulting in progressive heart failure—this damage can be disabling, and life-threatening. Amyloid deposits can also cause the heart wall to stiffen, resulting in progressing heart damage. Wild-type ATTR-CM, or wtATTR-CM, develops sporadically, meaning there is no genetic TTR mutation passed on through families. Symptoms for wtATTR-CM, which may initially be mild, typically emerge after age 65.
 hATTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive and life-threatening disease caused by the abnormal formation of the TTR protein and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including in peripheral nerves, the heart and intestinal tract. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these organs often leads to intractable peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy, as well as other disease manifestations. hATTR amyloidosis causes significant morbidity and progressive decline in quality of life, severely impacting activities of daily living. The disease often progresses rapidly and can lead to premature death. The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis. 
 AKCEA-TTR-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 The introduction of new medicines for the ATTR amyloidosis community should increase awareness and diagnosis while we develop AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We believe there are approximately 250,000 people diagnosed with ATTR amyloidosis. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 people diagnosed with wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy. There are currently around 50,000 hATTR amyloidosis patients worldwide. We believe the number of people with predominant cardiomyopathy symptoms is significantly underdiagnosed. We believe this is especially true in the African American population in which approximately 3% carry the V122I mutation, one of the most dominant mutations causing ATTR. The epidemiology of wild-type TTR amyloidosis is not well characterized, but we believe the number of patients diagnosed is rapidly increasing.  
Technology Overview
 Antisense Technology
 Ionis discovered each of the medicines in our pipeline using its innovative antisense technology platform. Antisense technology is based on the use of synthetic nucleic acid sequences, which are primarily used to interrupt the production of a specified protein by targeting the specific corresponding messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encodes that protein. In this way, antisense medicines can be used to reduce the level of proteins that cause, or contribute to, the progression of various diseases. Because there are virtually no undruggable mRNA targets, we believe antisense technology may have broader potential than small molecule- and antibody-based technologies that target proteins. Furthermore, antisense technology has the potential to target a growing number of disease-related genes more directly and efficiently than other protein-directed modalities. We believe this technology represents an important advance in treating diseases.
 12


The production of a protein starts with a process called transcription, where the instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA, into mRNA. The cell's protein production process is called translation, and antisense medicines can be designed to interrupt this process by causing the destruction of the targeted mRNA and therefore preventing the production of a protein of interest. The graphic below further illustrates the impact of antisense medicines on the production of proteins via this mechanism of action:
 

Ionis has made significant improvements in its antisense medicine technology in recent years, most notably the creation of the LICA technology. 
 The unique properties of our antisense medicines provide several potential advantages over traditional drug discovery technologies. These advantages include:
  
• | Precise specificity. Our antisense medicines are created using Ionis' advanced screening processes to bind specifically to the mRNAs they were designed to target, which minimizes or eliminates the possibility of our medicines binding to unintended genetic targets and causing unwanted side effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable dosing properties. We believe our medicines have predictable safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties based on Ionis' research and development experience. Further, our medicines have a relatively long half-life of two to four weeks, which enables second generation medicines such as WAYLIVRA to be dosed once weekly and other medicines in our pipeline, which incorporate Ionis' LICA technology, to potentially be dosed once monthly or less frequently. Upon dosing, our medicines distribute well throughout the body, eliminating the need for special formulations or delivery vehicles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct intervention in the disease process at the genetic level by targeting RNA: Antisense technology represents a direct route from gene to medicine. The explosion in genomic information and RNA biology has led to the discovery of many new disease-causing proteins and RNAs and has created new opportunities that are uniquely accessible to antisense technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to combine with other medicines: Because antisense medicines do not interact with the enzymes that metabolize or break down other medicines, physicians can use our medicines in combination with other medicines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Good medicine properties: Antisense medicines distribute well throughout the body without the need for special formulations or vehicles. They also have a relatively long half-life in the range of two to four weeks, which means patients and/or healthcare providers can dose our medicines weekly, monthly or even less frequently depending on the medicine and target tissue.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms. There are virtually no "undruggable" targets with antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient discovery and early development. Because of the efficiency of antisense technology, drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Relationship with Ionis
 Ionis formed Akcea as a wholly-owned subsidiary to complete development of and commercialize Ionis’ medicines to treat lipid disorders. We began business operations in January 2015. We licensed our cardiometabolic franchise from Ionis at the beginning of 2015. Prior to licensing these medicines, Ionis’ employees performed all of the development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for these medicines either themselves or through third-party providers. As such, Ionis incurred all of the expenses associated with these activities and reported them in its consolidated financial statements. We licensed TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx from Ionis in April 2018. Prior to then, Ionis had been advancing these medicines in development and incurring the expenses for those activities. Under our license agreements with Ionis, Ionis continued and is continuing to conduct certain development, regulatory and manufacturing activities for our medicines and we reimburse Ionis for these services. Also, under these license agreements, we are required to pay Ionis sublicense fees based on amounts we receive under license and collaboration agreements with others. In the past, Ionis has accepted certain payments owed by us in the form of Akcea common stock, rather than cash, which was determined based on 
 13


mutual agreement at the then fair market value of Akcea’s common shares. For example, as a result of the $250.0 million upfront license fee that we received in November 2019 from Pfizer as a result of the license agreement with Pfizer, we settled our $125.0 million obligation to Ionis in Akcea common stock. Ionis also accepted $75.0 million in Akcea common stock as payment for our obligation resulting from the $150.0 million license fee that we received from Novartis in February 2019 as a result of Novartis exercising their option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. However, Ionis may not choose to accept stock for future payments we owe Ionis. As of December 31, 2019, Ionis owned approximately 76 percent of our outstanding stock. As a result, we are controlled by Ionis and are a “controlled company” under the marketplace rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq.
 Exclusive Rights to Our Development Pipeline and Intellectual Property; Right of First Negotiation
 Ionis is a leading company researching and developing antisense medicines. Under our agreements with Ionis, we have rights to Ionis' proprietary technologies for use with our medicines. Specifically, we obtained an exclusive license from Ionis to globally commercialize our pipeline of medicines, including TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. Ionis also agreed that it would not work on its own or with other parties to develop or commercialize antisense medicines that target the same gene targets as the medicines we are developing and commercializing. We also have access to future improvements Ionis may make to its antisense technology platform, such as improved manufacturing technologies.
 In addition, Ionis has granted us a right of first negotiation with respect to Ionis development candidates that are designed to treat a rare cardiometabolic disease or a rare inherited metabolic disease. 
 Separately, Ionis also recently committed to potentially out-licensing additional medicines from its wholly owned pipeline to us, and we are currently in discussions with Ionis to potentially in-license a product that complements our rare disease expertise. We believe that our strong relationship with Ionis will continue to be a strategic advantage for Akcea, especially as Ionis’ pipeline continues to grow and expand into new rare disease areas for which Akcea could be a potential commercialization partner.
 Our Strategic Collaboration with Novartis
 In January 2017, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In February 2019, Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Novartis initiated a Phase 3 study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). Novartis is now responsible for all future development and commercialization activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Novartis and milestone payments if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to exclusively license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we and Novartis established a more definitive framework under which we may negotiate the co-commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx between the two companies in selected markets. Included in this framework is an option by which Novartis could solely commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in exchange for Novartis paying us increased commercial milestone payments based on sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We will share any milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
 
In December 2019, Novartis made a strategic portfolio decision not to exercise its option and to terminate its rights to AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and, consequently, we now retain the rights to AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. In January 2020, we reported positive Phase 2 top line results from this program in the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia who are at risk for, or have established, CVD. We and Ionis plan to initiate a Phase 3 program in FCS for this medicine in 2020 and we are evaluating development in additional rare and common diseases that are associated with high triglyceride levels. AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx also has the potential to favorably impact numerous other risk factors independently associated with CVD.
 Under our Novartis agreement, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment in February 2017, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid Ionis a $15.0 million sublicense fee, and Novartis purchased $100.0 million of Ionis' common stock at a premium. We also received a $150.0 million license fee when Novartis exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in February 2019, for which we issued 2,837,373 shares of our common stock to Ionis in March 2019, as payment for a $75.0 million sublicense fee. In addition to the upfront payment and license fee we are eligible to receive up to $675.0 million in milestone payments from Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $360.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, and Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will share any milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
14


If Novartis stops developing or commercializing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and we subsequently commercialize the medicine on our own or with another party, we are required to negotiate in good faith and mutually agree with Novartis the terms of a royalty payable to Novartis on the returned medicine.
 The agreement with Novartis will continue until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. In addition, the agreement as a whole or with respect to any medicine under the agreement may terminate early under the following situations:
  
• | Novartis may terminate the agreement as a whole or with respect to any medicine at any time by providing written notice to us;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement with respect to any medicine by providing written notice to the other party in good faith that we or Novartis have determined that the continued development or commercialization of the medicine presents safety concerns that pose an unacceptable risk or threat of harm in humans or would violate any applicable law, ethical principles or principles of scientific integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement for a medicine by providing written notice to the other party upon the other party's uncured failure to perform a material obligation related to the medicine under the agreement, or the entire agreement if the other party becomes insolvent; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may terminate the agreement if Novartis disputes or assists a third party to dispute the validity of any of our or Ionis' patents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under certain circumstances, the agreement with Novartis provides a mechanism to ensure that patients who were being treated with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx prior to such termination or who desire access to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx can continue to have access to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx while the regulatory and commercial responsibilities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx are transitioned from Novartis to us. Additionally, in January 2017, we and Ionis entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, or SPA, with Novartis. Under the SPA, in July 2017, Novartis purchased $50.0 million of our common stock in a separate private placement concurrent with the completion of our IPO at a price per share equal to the IPO price.
 Our Strategic Collaboration with Pfizer
 In October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer, which has a potential aggregate transaction value of up to $1.6 billion, plus royalties, which we would generally be required to share equally with Ionis. The calculation of potential aggregate transaction value assumes that Pfizer successfully develops and achieves regulatory approval for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in multiple indications in the U.S., E.U. and Japan, and that Pfizer achieves pre-specified sales targets with respect to AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. In addition to the upfront payment of $250.0 million that we received in November 2019, we are eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments, including up to $205.0 million for the achievement of development milestones, up to $250.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $850.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, and Pfizer will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will share any milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis. 
 The agreement with Pfizer will continue until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in all countries worldwide. In addition, the agreement may terminate early under the following situations:
  
• | Pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience by providing written notice to us; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to the first commercial sale of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, either we or Pfizer may terminate the Agreement on written notice to the other party if the other party is in material breach of its obligations thereunder and has not cured such breach within 30 days after notice in the case of a payment breach or 90 days after notice in the case of any other breach.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the agreement with Pfizer is terminated, we and Pfizer will negotiate in good faith terms governing transitional arrangements to ensure continuity of supply of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to patients.
 

Competition
 The commercialization of new medicines is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies and ultimately generic pharmaceutical companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, more convenient to use, or less costly than any that we are commercializing, or may obtain regulatory or reimbursement approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being 
 15


concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.
 TEGSEDI faces competition from medicines such as ONPATTRO, marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy, VYNDAQEL ® and VYNDAMAX™, both marketed by Pfizer, available in the U.S. for patients with both hereditary and wild type ATTR cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, and available in the E.U. for stage 1 hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. VYNDAQEL was also recently approved by the EC for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with ATTR-CM. ONPATTRO, which is an RNAi therapy made by Alnylam, is currently approved in the U.S., E.U and either approved or seeking approval in other geographies. The product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, requiring periodic blood and urine monitoring, and TEGSEDI also has a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program. Although ONPATTRO requires intravenous administration and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning or REMS. Beyond these medicines that are either marketed or under regulatory review, there are also additional medicines in clinical development. Alnylam is developing next generation RNAi medicine, vutrisiran, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy and wtATTR-CM. Alnylam is conducting additional clinical work for ONPATTRO and it is possible that Pfizer could do additional clinical work with VYNDAMAX and/or VYNDAQEL. Eidos is developing AG10 for patients with ATTR with cardiomyopathy and is currently enrolling a Phase 3 study. 
 With respect to WAYLIVRA to treat patients with FCS, NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals’ Gemcabene is being studied in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. NeuroBo announced in June 2018 that Gemcabene met its Phase 2b primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant lowering of triglycerides in severe hypertriglyceridemia. In August 2018, however, the FDA requested that NeuroBo produce data from a sub-chronic toxicology study to lift the partial clinical hold that was issued in 2004.  NeuroBo has announced that they will be submitting the request to lift the partial hold in the first half of 2020.
 Amryt Pharma’s Myalept, or metreleptin, is in a Phase 2 trial for FPL patients who also have NASH. Metreleptin is currently approved for use in the U.S. and E.U. in generalized lipodystrophy, or GL patients. Metreleptin does not affect apoC-III levels. ApoC-III levels have been shown to be elevated in FPL patients and directly correlated to triglyceride levels. In addition, many patients with FCS and FPL use diet, niacin, fish oils and/or fibrates to reduce their elevated triglycerides. Niacin, fish oils and fibrates are generally not effective in patients with FCS. The ultra-low-fat diet that patients with FCS and FPL are required to maintain is extremely burdensome to patients and their families. Based on our WAYLIVRA clinical experience, including in individuals with FCS, we believe that WAYLIVRA will work equally well as a single agent or in combination with other triglyceride-lowering medicines or approaches.
 With respect to WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, has presented Phase 1/2a clinical data of ARO-APOC3, an RNAi-based drug targeting apoC-III for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and FCS.  The key points presented included safety and tolerability. Arrowhead plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 study in 2020.  To our knowledge, there are currently no other direct competitors for lowering apoC-III in clinical development.
 With respect to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are not aware of any other medicines currently in clinical development specifically for the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and associated cardiovascular disease. Arrowhead and Amgen have a Phase 1 program ongoing for AMG890, formerly referred to as ARO-LPA, which uses an RNAi medicine conjugated with a GalNAc for the same target as AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. Under its strategic collaboration agreement with Alnylam, Ionis received an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to Alnylam's chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against apo(a), which means that Alnylam agreed not to use the exclusively licensed technology to develop or commercialize an oligonucleotide against apo(a).
 AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx may compete with Evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to ANGPTL3 that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing. Evinacumab is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH and Regeneron expects to file a New Drug Application, or NDA, in 2020. Evinacumab is also in Phase 2 development for severe forms of hypercholesterolemia and sever hypertriglyceridemia. Arrowhead also has an ongoing clinical program with an ANGPTL3 inhibitor, ARO-ANG3 which is currently in Phase 1 in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Arrowhead has said it plans to initiate Phase 3 for this program this year. 
 Intellectual Property
 We have in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our other medicines in development and, more generally, the development and commercialization of 
 16


oligonucleotide therapeutics. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our proprietary position to further protect our medicines.
 We obtained our rights to the patents covering TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA and our other medicines in development and our rights in Ionis' proprietary technology platform and know-how under our development, commercialization and license agreements with Ionis. We seek to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications by filing and prosecuting existing patent rights and filing additional patent applications.
 We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each medicine in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. The patent exclusivity period for a medicine will prevent generic medicines from entering the market during this period. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors, including initial patent term or, the natural term, and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 TTR, TEGSEDI and AKCEA-TTR-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' TTR patent estate to develop and commercialize TEGSEDI and the LICA follow-on medicine, AKCEA-TTR-LRx.  
 The TTR patent estate includes granted U.S. patents covering the TEGSEDI compound, composition, and uses (e.g. US 8,101,743; US 8,697,860; US 9,061,044; and US 9,399,774) that together provide a natural patent term to 2031. We have applied for patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review.  The issued claims protect TEGSEDI from generic competition in the U.S. until at least 2031.  Similar patents covering TEGSEDI are granted in several foreign jurisdictions including Europe and Japan.
 The TTR patent estate also includes granted and pending claims covering AKCEA-TTR-LRx worldwide. Granted claims in Europe cover the sequence of AKCEA-TTR-LRx and its use in treating transthyretin amyloidosis with natural patent term to 2031 (EP2563920). Claims covering the specific chemical composition of AKCEA-TTR-LRx and use in treating transthyretin amyloidosis are pending and have a natural patent term to 2034. Such patents may qualify for patent term extensions that may be obtained based on development and regulatory timeframes.
 ApoC-III, WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apoC-III patent estate to develop and commercialize WAYLIVRA and the LICA follow-on medicine, AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. The apoC-III patent estate includes patent claims in the U.S. drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to the mRNA of human apoC-III, including compounds designed to the region targeted by WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx (US 7,598,227) with a natural patent term of 2023. Similar claims covering compounds complementary to any site on human apoC-III have been granted in Australia.
 The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of WAYLIVRA in the U.S. (US 7,750,141), Australia and Europe (EP1622597). The issued claims in the U.S. should protect WAYLIVRA from generic competition in the U.S. until at least 2023. In addition, depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory review, this patent may be eligible for patent term restoration to recapture a portion of the term lost during such review. We are also pursuing additional patent applications directed to methods of using WAYLIVRA and other apoC-III compounds for treating various disorders, including FCS in jurisdictions worldwide. Claims drawn to methods of using apoC-III specific inhibitors, and specifically compounds designed to target the same sequence as WAYLIVRA and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, for treating FCS have issued in the U.S. (US 9,593,333) and have a natural term to 2034. Such patents may qualify for patent term extension based on development and regulatory timeframes.
 The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific chemical composition of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the U.S. (US 9,163,239). The claims should protect AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from generic competition until at least 2034. We are pursuing additional patent coverage for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 Apo(a) and AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apo(a) patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. The apo(a) patent estate includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in the U.S. (US 9,181,550). The issued claims directed to the composition should protect AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from generic competition in the U.S. until at least 2034. Such patents may qualify for patent term extension based on development and regulatory

timeframes. We are also pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect the AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx composition and additional dosing and methods of use in jurisdictions worldwide.
 ANGPTL3 and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Intellectual Property
 We have an exclusive license under Ionis' ANGPTL3 patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The ANGPTL3 patent estate includes issued patent claims drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to ANGPTL3 RNA for inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 (US 8,653,047). The ANGPTL3 patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in the U.S. (US 9,382,540). The issued claims directed to the chemical composition should protect AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx from generic competition until at least 2035. Such patents may qualify for patent term extension based on development and regulatory timeframes. We are pursuing additional patent claims designed to protect the sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to the protections afforded by patents and other regulatory protections, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets may be useful to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or which we elect not to patent. Trade secrets may also be useful for processes or improvements for which patents are difficult to enforce. We also protect our medicines and the proprietary technology platform through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Manufacturing
 Ionis has internal capabilities to manufacture medicines. Ionis has dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since Ionis can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide medicines, Ionis found that the same techniques used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide medicine could help improve the manufacturing processes for many other oligonucleotide medicines. With Ionis’ expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we and Ionis believe we can develop new processes to scale up manufacturing of our LICA medicines at commercially competitive prices. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up its manufacturing capabilities, Ionis has greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide medicines. For example, Ionis has significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing capacity to make the medicines. Through both Ionis’ internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors we and Ionis may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions. In connection with Novartis’ exercise of its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Novartis is responsible for the long-term supply for the licensed medicine. In addition, under our license agreement with Pfizer for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, Pfizer is responsible for the long-term supply for the licensed medicine.
 
TEGSEDI
 For TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce custom raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished goods. Our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise and current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, experience. We believe our current network of CMO partners are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as reduce risks. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in supply from our current CMO partners.
 CMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMO partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 WAYLIVRA
 Ionis has supplied us with API to complete our ongoing activities for WAYLIVRA, including commercial launch in the E.U. and potential commercial launch in the U.S. if approved. We believe the API and drug product are adequate for at least the first two years of WAYLIVRA’s commercial launch. We plan to leverage our relationships with CMOs to procure our own long-term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices.
 18


LICA Pipeline
 We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity, through Ionis, to meet our current development needs, including the ongoing studies for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and AKCEA-TTR-LRx. We believe that we have, or will be able to develop or acquire, sufficient supply capacity to meet our anticipated future needs. Ionis has supplied the API and the finished drug product for the clinical studies for each of the medicines in our pipeline through the completion of the on-going studies. Ionis also has agreed to supply and has supplied the API and the finished drug product for our medicines that we are developing ourselves. We and Ionis have long-standing and strong relationships with third-party vendors who can supply us with both API and finished drug product and are currently supplying API and finished drug product to other of Ionis' partners. Ionis also has long-standing and strong relationships with the vendors who supply the key raw materials to Ionis to make our medicines and to a major oligonucleotide CMO. We also believe that with anticipated benefits from increases in scale and improvements in chemistry, through Ionis or third parties, we will be able to manufacture our antisense medicines at commercially reasonable prices.
 To date, Ionis has manufactured itself or through a CMO, only limited supplies of LICA for their own and our own nonclinical and clinical studies for LICA-conjugated medicines. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. We believe Ionis’ expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides will enable the development of new processes to scale up manufacturing of these LICA conjugated medicines at commercially competitive prices.
 Government Regulation and Approval
 United States—FDA Process
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs. To obtain regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries, and subsequently comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we will need to spend substantial time and financial resources.
Approval Process
 The FDA must approve any new unapproved drug or certain changes to a previously approved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the U.S. If a company does not comply with applicable U.S. requirements, it may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, Warning or Untitled Letters, clinical holds, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The steps we must complete before we can market a drug include:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies start. The sponsor must update the IND annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of the study by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study begins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA's satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the drug application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, or regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 It generally takes companies many years to satisfy the FDA approval requirements, but this varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a drug's chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The company submits the results of the preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the drug's chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after submitting the initial IND.
 19


The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before a company can begin clinical testing in humans in the U.S. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND sponsor may begin the proposed clinical study. However, the FDA may, within the 30-day time period, raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical studies and place the clinical study on a clinical hold. In such a case, the company and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the company begins the clinical study. Accordingly, the submission of an IND may or may not be sufficient for the FDA to permit the sponsor to start a clinical study. The company must also make a separate submission to an existing IND for each successive clinical study conducted during drug development.
 Clinical Studies
 Clinical studies involve administering the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The company must conduct clinical studies:

• | in compliance with federal regulations;
--+----------------------------------------


• | in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical study sponsors, administrators and monitors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the safety monitoring parameters and the effectiveness criteria.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The company must submit each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical study at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the sponsor is not conducting the clinical study in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical study patients. The sponsor must also submit the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical studies to an IRB for approval. An IRB may halt the clinical study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Companies generally divide the clinical investigation of a drug into three or four phases.
  
• | Phase 1. The company evaluates the drug in healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies typically evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The company administers the drug to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The company administers the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the company's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While companies usually conduct these phases sequentially, they are sometimes overlapped or combined. A combined phase trial, such as a Phase 1/2 or a Phase 2/3 trial, is one that combines elements of objectives from two ordinarily sequential phases of development. For example, in a Phase 1/2 trial, the objectives may include both dose-finding and initial efficacy. In a Phase 2/3 trial, dosing regimen or population selection objectives are combined with confirmation of the safety and efficacy of the administration schedule in the intended population.
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to evaluate a drug's efficacy and safety to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations in which there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may oversee some clinical studies. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and the competitive climate.
 20


Submission of an NDA
 After we complete the required clinical testing, we can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, which must approve the NDA before we can start marketing the drug in the United States. An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing authorization, the data we submit must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug to the FDA's satisfaction.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA typically increases these fees annually. 
 Once the FDA accepts the filing on the agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 The FDA's Decision on an NDA
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application and the agency has determined that it will not approve the application in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Also, the government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw drug approvals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards or identifies problems following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing new NDAs. As with new NDAs, the FDA often significantly extends the review process with requests for additional information or clarification.
 21


Expedited review and accelerated approval programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its drug candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA's review and approval of NDAs. For example, the FDA may grant Fast Track Designation to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if the application meets relevant criteria. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical study(ies) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA grants priority review where there is evidence that the proposed drug would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If the criteria for priority review are not met, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The FDA generally requires post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing authorization to verify the drug's clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug can, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
 Post-approval Requirements
 The FDA regulates drugs that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals and has specific requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, drug sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. After approval, the FDA must provide review and approval for most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed drugs, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. There are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and depending on the significance of the change, it may require prior FDA approval before we can implement it. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs and we expect to continue to rely in the future on third parties for the production of such quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the drug from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial actions that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 22


The FDA may withdraw approval if a company does not comply with regulatory requirements and maintain standards or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. If a company or the FDA discovers previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes or the company's failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may require revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; impose post-marketing studies or other clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA refusing to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspending or revoking drug license approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. We could be subject to significant liability if we violated these laws and regulations.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug has orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which the FDA has granted an orphan designation.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Patent term can also be extended based on the amount of time the patented drug spends in regulatory review for drug approval. The length of time between drug launch and patent expiration is significantly less than the full 20-year patent term because companies often obtain the patents relating to a drug early in development and the development path for regulatory approval is long. In the U.S., The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called patent term restoration, for a patent on a drug governed by the FDCA. The length of patent term restoration is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term restoration can be a maximum of 5 years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of drug approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug in that jurisdiction.
 23


Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order to approve an ANDA, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug…"
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic drug is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider an "AB" therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of an "AB" rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application, and are not bioavailability or bioequivalence studies. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors must list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference drug in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the FDA will not approve the ANDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired.
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 24


Disclosure of Clinical Study Information
 Sponsors of clinical studies of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical study information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical study is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical studies after completion. Disclosure of the results of these studies can be delayed until the new drug or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Healthcare Reform
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;

 Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to or proposals to amend certain aspects of PPACA. We expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to it in the future.
 In addition, other health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since PPACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

European Union—EMA Process
 In the E.U., drugs follow a similar demanding process as that we described above for the U.S., and the ICH Common Technical Document is the basis for applications. Prior to submitting a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, it is necessary to gain approval of a detailed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the European Medicines Agency's Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. After gaining PIP approval, E.U. regulatory authorities can authorize the drug using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized Procedure
 Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the EC issues a single marketing authorization valid across the E.U., as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that: are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and are officially designated orphan drugs. For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. WAYLIVRA has been granted a Promising Innovative Medicine, or PIM, Designation by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for the treatment of people with FCS. A PIM Designation is an early indication that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, or EAMS, in the UK, intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition, with the potential to address an unmet medical need.
National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one E.U. country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any E.U. country and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one E.U. Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other E.U. countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Manufacturing Practices
 Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of drugs prior to approving a drug. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Once we or our partners commercialize drugs, we will be required to comply with cGMP and drug-specific regulations enforced by the EC, the EMA and the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States following drug approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a drug. If, as a result of these inspections, the regulatory agencies determine that our or our partners' equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of drug approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our drug from the market.
Data and Market Exclusivity
 Similar to the U.S., there is a process to authorize generic versions of innovative drugs in the E.U. Generic competitors can submit abridged applications to authorize generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator's data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug, among other things. New drugs in the E.U. can receive eight years of data exclusivity coupled with two years of market exclusivity, and a potential one-year extension, if the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates "significant clinical benefit" in comparison with existing therapies. This system is usually referred to as "8+2." Abridged applications cannot rely on an innovator's data until after expiry of the eight-year date exclusivity term, meaning that a competitor can file an application for a generic drug, but the drug cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.
 26


Other International Markets—Drug Approval Process
 In some international markets (such as China or Japan), although data generated in U.S. or E.U. studies may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, regulators may require additional clinical studies conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any medicine for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and in other countries, sales of any medicine for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer's decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a drug to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the drug after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its drugs at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drugs, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our drugs.
 In the European community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those drugs to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any medicine for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the U.S. and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more medicines for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Sales and Marketing
 Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.
 In the U.S. sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and abuse," including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called "responsible corporate officer" doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
 Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the E.U. and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our medicines, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity, it can have adverse implications for us.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the U.S., can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
