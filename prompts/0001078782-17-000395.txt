ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Summary

Sigma is a software company that has developed quality assurance software known as PrintRite3D®, which Sigma believes solves the major problems that have prevented large-scale metal part production using 3D printers...real-time computer-aided inspection (CAI). GE Aviation, for example, has stated that it plans to commit $3.5 billion by 2020 to, among other things, build a metal 3D production facility for its Leap engine and other engines to produce the applicable 3D printed parts. However, without companies like GE Aviation effectively being able to check each part for shape, density, strength and consistency real-time during the manufacturing process, we believe that such companies will not be able to address the major problems currently preventing large-scale metal 3D production. We believe that our software, which is positioned inside the 3D metal printer, solves these problems by assuring each part is being made to the specifications of the computer file as it is being made. We enable 3D prototyping to become 3D manufacturing. Instead of performing quality assurance (QA) post production, our PrintRite3D® software could fundamentally redefine conventional QA by embedding quality assurance and process control into the manufacturing process in real time. We have filed patent applications directed to our In-Process Quality Assurance (IPQA®) procedure for advanced manufacturing. In addition, we anticipate that our core PrintRite3D® software will enable our customers to combine their advanced manufacturing technologies with our 3D manufacturing QA to achieve both cost savings and stronger parts. Vertical markets that we believe would benefit from our technology and software include aerospace, defense, bio-medical, power generation, and oil & gas industries. We provide our software products to customers in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS).
About 3D Printing

3D printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing (AM) is changing the world by going directly from computer graphics to real parts. 3D printing has been applied to the manufacture of plastic parts for several years. 3D manufacturing of metal parts involves directing a laser or other energy source at a layer of powdered metal and melting it. These layers become melted together from the bottom up. Revenues attributable to 3D manufacturing for metal products were $88.1 million in 2015 (Wohlers Report 2016, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing State of the Industry  Annual Worldwide Progress Report).

The application of 3D printing to high-tolerance, precision manufactured metal parts has only recently emerged. 3D printing of metal parts today represents only a minor percentage of all 3D manufacturing. However, we believe the greatest future growth for 3D printing appears to be in metal parts given the interest and investment being made by Fortune 100 companies, Federal government laboratories and agencies as well as university-based institutions. Emphasis from these high-end manufacturers and technology leaders is strongly focused on quality and precision manufacturing for high-tolerance parts. We believe the on-going success of 3D printing for metal parts will be highly dependent upon the quality assurance procedure used such as our PrintRite3D® methodology.

About Quality Assurance in 3D Printing

Current methods for providing quality are cost prohibitive because approximately 25% of parts produced by 3D printing need to be destroyed in the post-production quality control process. Additional costs are incurred by using non-traditional x-ray scanning technology on these parts. We offer our clients the ability to use real-time sensors to track each layer, and our software continuously analyzes the part so that when it is finished we know if it is production quality. We believe our PrintRite3D® software could reduce inspection costs by a factor of 10 and development time for new parts by 50% or more.

By using PrintRite3D® software, a high-precision manufacturer would have the ability to offer its customers, on an exclusive basis, product guarantees and assurances that its product was produced in compliance with stringent quality requirements. Initial orders have been received from GE Aviation, Honeywell Aerospace, Aeroject Rocketdyne, Woodward, Siemens and Pratt & Whitney.

We believe there is potential for our PrintRite3D® software to be incorporated into a majority of 3D metal printing devices made by companies like Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), Additive Industries, Concept Lasers, Trumpf Lasers, Renishaw, Sentrol, Farsoon and others.

Sigmas Cloud-Based IIoT Solutions

The process of making a 3D printed part could start with our customers loading a CAD model of the part into the Cloud shown in A in Figure 1. Next, CAE/CAM instructions are sent to the 3D printer (see B, as shown in Figure 1). Metal powder in the machine is then deposited onto the build platform where a laser beam or other energy focused onto the build platform melts each successive layer of powder in 20-50 micron increments. Our CAI sensors (see C in Figure 1) detect, record, analyze and compare the part as it is being made layer-by-layer against the CAD specifications and physical reference points for quality assurance during the manufacturing. Our software certifies the shape, strength, and internal density of each part, which eliminates the need to: (1) destroy a large percentage of the parts during process validation and in post-production quality assurance; and (2) retain all of the metal as opposed to cutting pieces and wasting metal. 

Our PrintRite3D® CAI web-based software (see D in Figure 1) is being designed to reside in the Cloud (see A in Figure 1) of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We enable manufacturing engineers to assure the part quality layer-by-layer, provide for manufacturing statistical process control and harvest, aggregate, and analyze Big Data from the manufacturing real-time data collected from our PrintRite3D® SENSORPAK (see C in Figure 1), as well as post-process manufacturing data collected by our customers (see E in Figure 1).

Our specialized sensor suite (see C in Figure 1), known as PrintRite3D® SENSORPAK, is an IIoT-compliant edge computing device. It contains the modular hardware and software necessary to connect to cyber-physical objects (see B in Figure 1) living on the manufacturing floor. It allows for bi-directional information flow between the manufacturing floor and the Cloud (see A in Figure 1). It starts a million-fold data reduction that finishes with our PrintRite3D® CAI software, which provides customers with product guarantees and assurances that parts were produced in compliance with stringent quality standards. It can collect, analyze, aggregate, filter, and then further communicate data from the manufacturing floor to the Cloud (see A in Figure 1) and enable links to other areas (see F in Figure 1) of the IIoT.

We generate revenues through PrintRite3D® hardware and sensor sales and CAI software licensing of our PrintRite3D® technology to customers that seek to improve their manufacturing production processes, and through ongoing annual software upgrades and maintenance fees. Additionally, we generate revenues from our contract manufacturing activities in metal AM. By running a contract AM services operation, we are able to understand the current needs of our customers and where they are going with their next-generation product development efforts. Contract AM further allows us a means for continuing/self-funding our IPQA®-enabled R&D and product development activities for PrintRite3D® CAI software. We provide our AM contract manufacturing services to customers in the form of Quality as a Service (QaaS). Starting with our PrintRite3D® cloud-based SaaS model, customers will contract with us for CAE, CAM and CAI services to generate and establish a digital quality record (DQR) for AM built parts. Each DQR is cloud-based and allows for archiving and storage of quality data, access to our big data ANALYTICS software App for continuous quality monitoring and improvement, and automatic industry benchmarking while maintaining firewalls between company-specific data.

In late 2015, we launched two programs − an Early Adopter Program (“EAP”) and an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) Partner Program − designed to broaden our market presence and speed adoption of our PrintRite3D® technology. The EAP was designed to attract end user customers who have an existing, installed base of 3D metal printers and to offer them incentivized pricing in return for feedback on initial and beta releases of our PrintRite3D® software Apps. Our OEM Partner Program was specifically designed for AM machine manufacturers seeking to embed our PrintRite3D® quality assurance software Apps directly into their machines for customers purchasing a turnkey solution for their new AM machine purchases.

We possess the resident expertise to provide manufacturing materials and process (M&P) engineering services and support to companies using our PrintRite3D® software Apps for metal AM. Accordingly, in addition to our primary business focus, we intend to generate revenues by providing such manufacturing engineering services and support to businesses licensing our PrintRite3D® software Apps.

Additionally, our President and Chief Executive Officer has worked at or with the Edison Welding Institute, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories (including the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory) over the last 32 years. Due to his work with the DOE, our President and Chief Executive Officer has developed extensive relationships with the DOE and its network of national laboratories. Accordingly, we expect to leverage these relationships in connection with licensing and developing technologies created at such national laboratories for commercialization in the private sector.

Early-Stage Technology Commercialization and Market Positioning

Since our inception in 2010, we have made progress in bringing early-stage disruptive technology from scientific concept and curiosity to practical reality, as described below.

PrintRite3D® Quality Assurance Software for Computer-Aided Inspection of Metal Additive Manufacturing. 

We believe that AM will significantly impact the manufacturing landscape. AM results in very efficient metal utilization for parts made on-demand, and utilizes a wide variety of rapid prototyping methods. As a result of AM, parts can go straight from computer-aided designs (CAD) and 3D computer models to actual, physical parts through the use of computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) steps. However, there are severe challenges in connection with 3D printing of metal parts. Current manufacturing processes are not capable of making every part right the first time. Also, process consistency and repeatability require further development for metal parts and this is a typical case for emerging technologies. Although many industry experts have lamented that 3D Printing for metal parts is limited in current applications, we are developing our IPQA®-enabled technology into a hardware and software suite of products for CAI of AM known as PrintRite3D®, which we expect will address some these shortcomings and enable mass production for metals AM technology to be realized sooner than would otherwise be possible given its current state of maturity. PrintRite3D® comprises a suite of CAI software apps that address the three fundamental problems facing metal AM today, namely: assuring the metal integrity or quality of the product; assuring the as-built geometry of the product; and, increasing the productivity or speed of the AM process.

Contract Manufacturing for Metal Additive Manufacturing. 

According to the Wohlers 2016 Annual Report, industry growth in the service provider segment in 2015 was an estimated $2.8 billion, an increase of 33% from $2.105 billion in 2014. This market segment grew by 38.9% in 2014, 26.3% in 2013, and 36.4% in 2012. End users are still in the early stages of adding metal AM systems to supply production parts to aerospace and defense OEMs, such as GE Aviation (GEA), Honeywell Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Siemens Turbomachinery. We believe that most AM machines produced through 2016 are still not well suited for production applications. They have limited feedback measurement and control sensors to guarantee part quality real time. Some of the latest machines available, such as EOSs M290 machine, are beginning to be sold with limited advanced measurement system capability.

We believe that this service provider market segment represents an opportunity for us to capture significant portions of the demand for metal production parts. Accordingly, we acquired our first EOS M290 metal printing machine in 2014. Using the M280 as its base, the M290 adds improved energy efficiencies, faster build times, and slightly larger build platform capabilities. Through our EOS M290 machine, our customers will gain the benefits of many years of M280-proven applications while accessing the latest in DMLS® technology, as well as receiving parts certifiably produced using our state-of-the-art PrintRite3D® quality assurance software Apps. We provide our AM contract manufacturing services to customers in the form of Quality as a Service. 

A detailed description of our technologies and business follows.

PrintRite3D® Quality Assurance Software for Additive Manufacturing

The Market

An area of increasing interest in the manufacturing world is AM or 3DP. AM is a method of producing functional parts directly from computer design or CAD files without any tooling or other processing.

The sale of AM products and services is expected to exceed $8.8 billion worldwide in 2017. The AM industry is expected to grow to about $15.8 billion in 2019. In 2021, the AM industry is forecasted to grow to about $26.5 billion, all according to the Wohlers 2016 Annual Report.

Metal parts are a rapidly growing segment of this overall market space as AM or 3D printing moves from just making models to making actual, fully functional parts. Large end users such as Honeywell Aerospace, GEA and Boeing Defense view AM as an enabling process for many components. A recent report in a series by Deloitte University Press on additive manufacturing published in Fall 2015 titled, 3D Opportunity For Quality Assurance and Parts Qualification, states that, [o]ne of the most important barriers is the qualification of AM-produced parts. So crucial is this issue, in fact, that many characterize quality assurance (QA) as the single biggest hurdle to widespread adoption of AM technology, particularly for metal. We believe that OEM end user companies as well as first-tier suppliers cannot achieve their long-term AM production goals without advanced quality assurance and control technologies for metal AM parts because current quality control methods are not sufficient to reliably allow cost-effective manufacturing of safety- and performance-critical metal parts. We believe that our PrintRite3D® CAI technology would directly address this important barrier for metal parts and allow such AM applications to move forward. In response to this need, we have experienced an increase in our installed base of PrintRite3D® systems and we are beginning to provide material & process engineering services and support for our PrintRite3D® software licenses for our installed base at GEA, Honeywell Aerospace, Spartacus3D, Additive Industries, Aerojet Rocketdyne, 3D Material Technologies, LLC, Woodward, Siemens, Pratt & Whitney, and the Edison Welding Institute (EWI).

We have ongoing contracts that include a Phase 3 project with Honeywell Aerospace funded by the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) on the application of our PrintRite3D® technology to performance-critical AM metal parts for aerospace. This project is vitally important because it provided an early opportunity to demonstrate how our IPQA®-enabled PrintRite3D® software Apps will reduce our customers reliance on unnecessary post process inspection, ultimately reducing costs and improving quality for AM of highly critical aerospace metal components. Also, we were a participant on a GEA led team of companies and universities, which was awarded a research contract by the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII or America Makes) titled, In-Process Quality Assurance for Laser Powder Bed Production of Aerospace Components. The contract has the stated objective of maturing our In Process Quality Assurance (IPQA®) technology for aerospace applications by leveraging a development approach incorporating multiple AM OEM machines, multiple superalloys, and multiple product intent aerospace components. In support of this effort, we were awarded related contracts from the subcontractor Aerojet Rocketdyne to install one of our PrintRite3D® systems and software Apps on a Concept Laser M2 metal AM machine at Aerojet Rocketdynes Canoga Park, California facility, as well as a contract from Honeywell Aerospace to make initial test specimens for reliability and repeatability testing using our EOS M290 printer. We were also part of a large research team, led by the Edison Welding Institute that was awarded a grant funded by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) to ensure that quality parts are produced and certified for use in products made by a variety of industries and their supply chains. The emphasis was on providing tools needed for additive manufacturing applications to progress from prototype to serial production. This program was successfully completed in Fall 2015. We are currently a subcontractor to Honeywell Aerospace who was awarded a program in 2015 by America Makes which is designed to address Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) issues. In support of this program, we will use our EOS M290 printer to build canonical shapes and mechanical test specimens for evaluation by Honeywell Aerospace. 

Technology and Competitive Advantage

The evolution of AM from prototyping to volume manufacturing in production runs is occurring in, and led by, aerospace while also appearing in niche products such as medical appliances and replacement parts of diverse applications, including unavailable parts required by still deployed but aging technologies. A major problem for 3D metal products production-run manufacturing today is that traditional quality systems rely heavily on after-manufacture inspection procedures that lack strong statistical reliability in small lot manufacturing. Post-production non-destructive test instruments from ultrasound to CT Scans are either not effective or not cost efficient on many complex part configurations that take advantage of 3D capability, and in the case of CT scans, are prohibitively expensive for production cost efficiency. The most important feature of our PrintRite3D® is that it develops actionable quality and process control data of manufacturing information in real-time and, when no flaws are detected, can provide manufacturers and their end-users with a part-by-part quality certification backed up by a file of supporting data.

Our PrintRite3D® suite, as described below, is composed of hardware, software, data analytics, and proprietary algorithms. The hardware is an array of photodiodes, non-contact pyrometer, and a data processing unit that can be either sold with an AM manufacturing machine unit by an OEM manufacturer or retrofitted on customers sites.

·
 PrintRite3D® SENSORPAK  the auxiliary sensor and hardware kit that sits on every AM machine to collect the data to drive the software.
 ·
 PrintRite3D® INSPECT  software which verifies quality layer by layer.
 ·
 PrintRite3D® CONTOUR  software which assures the as-built geometry.

The following software modules are currently in development:

·
 PrintRite3D® ANALYTICS  software that harvests, aggregates, and analyzes big data from in-process manufacturing data and post-process manufacturing data. 
 ·
 PrintRite3D® THERMAL  software which predicts the residual stress and distortion in the part.

The proprietary software and its embedded algorithms process the very substantial quantity of layer by layer data gathered and then informs operators of the Quality Compliance status of each part in a build. We have been active in patent protecting our in-depth data analysis and quality algorithms to link our analysis to root cause metallurgy for determining the granular quantification of the part conformance to metallurgical requirements such as tensile strength. Concurrent with assessing the internal quality features of all parts in a build, PrintRite3D® deploys its CONTOUR module that measures each parts adherence to the configuration specification of both internal channels and external form. OEM machine manufacturers as well as control system manufacturers may use the Sigma data stream to direct machine performance adjustments.

We have developed a tool that enables companies using Additive Manufacturing equipment for metal parts to move from prototyping on into production runs by assuring quality in a uniquely reliable and cost effective fashion. Not only does PrintRite3D® enable a single AM machine to operate at high quality yields, by measuring the product of the manufacturing equipment rather than just the equipment settings, it also is a reliable method to assure and document uniform quality assurance of a single parts specification being manufactured by factories utilizing a number of different AM machines.

We believe that the broad domain coverage of our PrintRite3D® patents and metallurgical know-how make the licensing of our product suite to be the best means by which Additive Manufacturing OEM equipment manufacturers can offer in-process-quality-monitoring that certifies and documents the quality of all parts that pass continuous inspection. PrintRite3D® provides 3D metal manufacturing equipment makers with a patent protected data configuration of information that the manufacturers may use to adjust controls of their equipment in response to real-time quality information by, for example, precisely adjusting laser power to sustain manufacturing to design and specification.

Our IPQA®-enabled PrintRite3D® software Apps appear well suited to meet the needs of metal AM at this critical juncture in its development. Our technology will allow metal AM to be used during manufacturing of safety-critical or performance-critical metal parts, such as used in aerospace, defense and biomedical. Currently, these applications are difficult because the part quality cannot be completely guaranteed using todays conventional nondestructive inspection technologies, because using inspection after manufacturing is difficult, costly and does not find all defects of concern. Therefore, we believe that PrintRite3D® could be an enabler for metal AM to realize its full potential. We have unique and patent protected offerings in this field. Furthermore, as a greater number of these AM applications could be cloud-based, the PrintRite3D® technology is fully compatible with highly networked, cloud- or web-based implementation  subject to the data and intellectual property restrictions which may be imposed by some companies for competitive reasons.

Our proprietary PrintRite3D® software Apps have been demonstrated and tested at many manufacturing sites around the world. We believe these demonstrations have served to validate the underlying technology of PrintRite3D® INSPECT and SENSORPAK software and hardware modules, respectively. In addition, we have developed relationships with experienced aerospace companies in North America that have assisted in the validation of the underlying technology for our PrintRite3D® software App known as CONTOUR.

We continue to work with General Electric under our Joint Technology Development Agreement (JTDA), dated April 10, 2013, to demonstrate and implement our in-process inspection technologies for additive manufactured jet engine components. We are continuing to work with Honeywell Aerospace on the separate development of our PrintRite3D® CONTOUR software App for metal-based AM under our Trial Evaluation Agreement with Honeywell Aerospace, which sets forth the parties intent to use Honeywells Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center as a beta test site for our PrintRite3D® CONTOUR software module. In further support of this effort, in 2015 Honeywell Aerospace installed its second PrintRite3D® system on one of its Concept Laser M2 machines at their Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

We have expanded our market presence and associated installed base of PrintRite3D® systems through our EAP and our OEM Partner Program to include European companies in France, Germany and The Netherlands. These European partners installations are key to our long term strategy to broaden its installed base through our EAP as well as gain market presence though embedded OEM offerings of our PrintRite3D® technology. Our PrintRite3D® product commercialization efforts reflect the strategic nature of our selective alliance partnerships.

We believe PrintRite3D® is uniquely positioned to grow into this market as its technology is platform independent and deployable with all currently known metal AM manufacturing units.
 
10

Business Model

Our current commercialization strategy for PrintRite3D® products is: 

·
 Enter into early adopter license agreements with high potential future AM equipment manufacturers and complex part AM manufacturing service bureaus; 
 ·
 Enter into OEM license agreements for PrintRite3D® to be manufactured directly into the printers of major AM equipment manufacturers; 
 ·
 Provide manufacturing engineering consulting services to third parties that have needs in developing quality assurance tactical methods for manufacturing; and 
 ·
 Build and run a contract manufacturing division for metal AM commencing with our EOS M290 state-of-the art metal printer.

PrintRite3D® is designed to run on different machine platforms which allow us to maximize our product offering to the entire AM metal market. The target markets include OEMs both on the AM software side as well as OEM machine producers and end users. 

We believe another much needed area for AM metal parts manufacturing is in software Apps for reducing design and development cycle times, saving the end customer time and money. In support of that, in 2016, we entered into a Technology Development Agreement with 3DSIM, LLC of Park City, Utah, to pursue commercial metal AM software opportunities for rapid qualification and part certification. These software Apps could form the underpinnings and backbone of a conceptual software App known as THERMAL. We expect in the future to attempt to develop and offer a PrintRite3D® suite of Apps which would be specifically developed to improve part designs and reduce traditional trial and error design approaches for features such as distortion control.

To summarize, we have formed an operating division focused on real-time, advanced quality assurance solutions for additive manufacturing thereby increasing the value of the AM part. Although in the past our revenues have been generated mainly through engineering consulting services we provided to third parties, We have generated revenues from December 2013 through December 2016 through sales and licensing of our PrintRite3D® systems and software.

Contract Manufacturing for Metal Additive Manufacturing

The Market

According to the Wohlers 2016 Report, in 2015 the Additive Manufacturing industrys primary and secondary worldwide revenues were $7.024 billion, up 22% from 2014. Wohlers forecasts that AMs primary revenues alone will top $8.8 billion in 2017. Our initial target market within this burgeoning marketplace is the production of metal parts. According to figures for 2015, revenues attributable to metals for AM are estimated to be over 17% of the total revenues in the AM markets.

As demand continues to increase for AM prototyping services, contract AM service bureau providers that can deliver low-rate initial production capacity, and as commercial companies in highly-regulated industries begin to gain regulatory acceptance for AM designed parts, we believe there is a burgeoning need for contract manufacturing services to produce these much need metal AM parts. The existing service bureau for AM parts has become much smaller today as a result of merger and acquisition activities since 2012, and we believe what remains is small, fragmented and less capable than the first generation of service bureau providers.

Also launched in 2015, Arete-Sigma is a joint venture targeting contract AM manufacturing as it anchors the Companys entry into day-to-day AM manufacturing. The Company is pursuing business opportunities away from the joint venture utilizing its EOS M290 printer or like machines.

Technology and Competitive Advantage

We currently have an AM 3D metal printing facility that employs state-of-the-art technology from the leading provider of metal AM systems, Electro-Optical Systems. While our current printing capacity is limited, we believe that a unique selling point or competitive advantage is our PrintRite3D® technology. Our EOS M290 printer is outfitted with our latest PrintRite3D®-enabled technology allowing us to provide customers with the necessary objective evidence of compliance to design intent, or QaaS data package, to ensure they can meet compliance with their design intent and ultimately end-user performance requirements for their highly-critical and demanding components. Our Quality as a Service starts with our PrintRite3D® cloud-based SaaS model. Customers will contract with Sigma to generate and establish a digital quality record for AM built parts based on Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) principles. Each DQR is cloud-based and allows for archiving and storage of quality data, access to our big data ANALYTICS software App for continuous quality monitoring and improvement, and automatic industry benchmarking while maintaining firewalls between company-specific data. Our QaaS service benefits our customers by providing independent quality assurance and increased process intelligence and access to our latest big data sophisticated and proprietary ANALYTICS software Apps for trending and additional manufacturing intelligence. 
Business Model

We envision a business model comprising revenues from contract, metal AM manufacturing sales for prototyping services as well as QaaS sales for low-rate initial production parts requiring our PrintRite3D® digital quality records. These DQRs can be used by our customers for: 

·
 Internal use at their captive AM facility to make parts; 
 ·
 Incorporated as a quality requirement to their vendor base supplying AM parts; or 
 ·
 Contract back to us to supply AM parts. 

This model allows us to realize revenues through further PrintRite3D® software sales and licensing or revenues from contract AM manufacturing services. The target markets would be end users requiring high-end metal parts such as in the aerospace, bio-medical, power generation, and automotive markets. 

To summarize, we have formed an operating division focused QaaS which is based on its contract additive manufacturing capability and its AM facility keeps us on the cutting edge of 3D metal additive manufacturing as we work with the market to develop state of the moment solutions and to characterize new materials and newly born DFAM parts. The operations are at an early stage, limited, and revenues are reflective of its early stage. 

Recent Developments (in reverse chronological order)

On March 29, 2017, we announced that we entered into a long term non-exclusive commercial agreement with Additive Industries B.V. of The Netherlands. As part of the multi-year agreement, anticipated to be worth several million dollars over the next few years, Additive Industries will join our previously-announced OEM Partner Program  embedding and reselling our PrintRite3D® software within our AM equipment.

In an effort to bring enhanced solutions for additive manufacturing (AM) to the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector and capitalize on growth in demand for 3D printed metal components within the A&D industry, we recently entered into a strategic alliance with Morf3D, a California-based company that specializes in additive engineering and manufacturing with metals and that provides advisory services in additive manufacturing strategy and technology adoption road-mapping. By leveraging our PrintRite3D® quality assurance software, we believe that Morf3D will be able to provide a means for its customers to increase AM production rates while ensuring consistent part quality, thereby better meeting the high quality demands of its aerospace customers. We also plan to work together with Morf3D to manufacture certain 3D printed parts. Morph3D has informed us that it is a party to development contracts with aircraft, space, medical and automotive customers, and that it expects to commence serial production contracts in 2017. We believe that by working together with Morf3D, we will be in a position to design, manufacture, and assure the quality of AM components across a number of important aerospace applications, which could lead to the generation of a meaningful amount of additional revenue for our company beginning in 2017.
 
12

On March 27, 2017, we completed funding a loan in the principal amount of $500,000 to Morf3D pursuant to a Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated March 27, 2017 delivered by Morf3D to us. The loan bears interest at the rate of 7% per annum, is due and payable in full on March 27, 2018, is secured by certain assets of Morf3D, and is convertible at our option into 10% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Morf3D unless Morf3D exercises its right under specified circumstances to repay all principal and accrued interest on the loan. The purpose of the loan is to provide working capital to Morf3D to, among other things, lease an EOS M 400 system for Morf3D for Morf3D to expand production for contracts related to AM of high-precision aerospace & defense components, in furtherance of our strategic alliance and in contemplation of a possible acquisition of or merger with Morf3D.

On February 21, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,410,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The underwriter exercised the over-allotment option covering additional warrants to purchase up to 211,500 additional shares of common stock. Gross proceeds to us from the offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $5.8 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. 

On January 26, 2017, we announced that we signed a commercial agreement with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., for our PrintRite3D® software along with participation by Pratt & Whitney in our Early Adopter Program. 

On January 19, 2017, we announced that we entered into a long term non-exclusive commercial agreement with a leading European provider of cutting-edge products for additive manufacturing to join our previously-announced OEM Partner Program. Under the multi-year agreement  anticipated to be worth up to $6 million over its duration  this undisclosed OEM will embed and resell Sigmas PrintRite3D® software within its AM equipment. 

On December 21, 2016, we announced that we received a contract from Honeywell Aerospace as part of a previously-announced award with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) for Open Manufacturing (OM) Phase III; Phase I and II were completed in 2014 and earlier in 2016, respectively. The DARPA OM programs goal is to develop an Integrated Computational Material Engineering (ICME) framework to accurately predict the properties of metal components produced using additive manufacturing (AM). Phase III work began in January 2017 and is expected to run through mid-2018, with a total award value to us of approximately $0.4 million.

Separately, we received an order from Aerojet Rocketdyne under the previously-announced America Makes additive manufacturing research project with GE Aviation. The program, funded by the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII), uses our proprietary In-Process Quality Assurance (IPQA®) software for advanced AM monitoring. This is the second PrintRite3D® system being deployed under America Makes, the first being with GE Aviation. 

On January 27, 2016, we announced that we entered into a technology development agreement with 3DSIM, LLC to pursue commercial metal AM software opportunities for rapid qualification and part certification. 3DSIM, based in Park City, Utah, is a provider of simulation software for metal AM processes.

Competition

We believe our technologies will be beneficial to several industries, including aerospace, defense, oil and gas, bio-medical, and power generation. However, developments by others may render our current and proposed technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Additionally, our competitive position may be materially affected by our ability to develop or successfully commercialize certain technologies that we have identified for commercialization. Other general external factors may also impact the ability of our products to meet expectations or effectively compete, including pricing pressures.

We anticipate some of our principal competitors in the United States will include AM End Users, such as GE Aviation, Honeywell Aerospace, Rolls-Royce PLC, Pratt & Whitney; AM OEM equipment manufacturers, such as EOS, Concept Lasers, 3D Systems, Renishaw, Arcam and SLM; third party solution providers like Stratonics Inc., and Vibrant Corporation that specialize in designing and manufacturing quality control monitoring devices used in industrial applications. Most of these competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more sales, marketing and financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. In addition, acquisitions of, or investments in, competing companies by large corporations could increase such competitors research, financial, manufacturing and other resources.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expenses relate to our engineering activities, which consist of the development of our PrintRite3D® quality assurance technologies for specific customers and for the industry in general. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $92,992 and $330,554, of research and development costs, respectively.
Intellectual Property

We regard our patents, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property law, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions with employees, partners, and others to protect the technology and other proprietary rights, information and know-how that comprise the core of our business. The below chart summarizes our issued patents. We are currently prosecuting ten foreign and U.S. patent applications related to our IPQA® technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal parts.

Government Regulation

Any contracts that we enter into with governmental agencies will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are aimed at preventing the inadvertent disclosure of munitions related data or the export of technical knowledge to foreign countries. The work we do with governmental units may also be subject to laws respecting the confidentiality of any classified or national security information we receive during the course of our activities under any government contract.

Additionally, with respect to our work with government agencies, our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoDs Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). These agencies review a contractors performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and information systems.
