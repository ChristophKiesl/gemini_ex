Item 1. Business.
Overview
Medallia, Inc. was founded in 2001 to help the world’s largest companies understand and improve customer experiences at scale. In doing so, we created a new category of enterprise software, experience management. 
Our SaaS platform, the Medallia Experience Cloud, is built on modern technology and open architecture, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze massive amounts of data. We capture experience data from the expanding signal fields emitted by customers and employees on their daily journeys so that our customers can understand and manage omni-channel experiences. We utilize our proprietary in-memory analytics, dynamic organizational hierarchy management, and AI technology to analyze the structured and unstructured data at great scale with enterprise grade security and privacy deriving themes and predictive insights that drive action in live time. Using our technology, enterprises reduce churn, turn detractors into promoters and buyers, and create in-the-moment cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, providing high returns on investment.
Our platform captures and analyzes over 6.0 billion experiences annually and has performed 8 trillion calculations in a single day to drive business decisions. Our products have high adoption rates and are used extensively from the front line to the C-Suite; over half of our customers have more than 1,000 employees using our platform. Our platform is deeply embedded in an enterprise’s tech stack, with enterprises integrating Medallia with an average of 25 other business applications. We believe this is significantly higher adoption than other experience management solutions available in the market.
We offer our platform through a SaaS business model. We use a “land and expand” model, whereby once customers have deployed our platform they often increase the number of end-users through expansion to additional business units and geographies, and they also purchase more modules. We focus our selling efforts on both business leaders who are often making a strategic purchase of our platform with the potential for broad use throughout their enterprises, as well as functional leaders purchasing for their teams. We price our subscriptions based on the functionality and capacity needs of our customers. Subscription periods for our customers generally range from one to three years and we customarily invoice customers in advance in annual installments. 
Our Products
Our SaaS platform was purpose-built for customer experience, the largest segment of experience management and the most critical segment for enterprises to manage and master in order to drive transformational business impact. Our platform captures a myriad of signals, uses analytics and artificial intelligence allowing our customers to separate the noise and identify key themes that impact their business. Through our dynamic organizational hierarchies, we route these insights to the right individuals to take action, so that our customers can improve customer experience throughout their organizations in live time.
Signal Capture
In addition to native feedback collection capabilities, we offer numerous products for enterprises to capture signals in various channels and across the customer journey, some of which include:
Medallia Conversations. Enables customers, employees and enterprises to engage customers and employees on popular messaging platforms (i.e. SMS, text and WeChat) as experiences are unfolding. It provides in-the-moment feedback and creates compelling and adaptive interactions that go beyond traditional survey-based feedback collection. 
Medallia Crowdicity. Helps companies use real-time ideation and collaboration to surface, develop and evaluate potential improvements to customer and employee experiences.

Medallia Digital. Optimizes engagement across all digital channels, such as web and mobile applications, internet of things (IoT) platforms, and Alexa. Medallia Digital is designed to help deliver the right experiences across numerous digital channels through integrations into our customers’ digital technology stacks, combining experience and behavioral data enabling them to understand the “why” behind the “what.”
Medallia Employee Ideas. Enables employees to provide feedback regarding their experiences that impact both customers and employees.
Medallia LivingLens. Captures video signals and transforms them to speech, emotion and sentiment, providing insight into customers and employees feelings, wants and needs.
Medallia Social. Captures feedback and promotes ratings and reviews across social networks and websites to manage social reputation, access competitor reviews and enables enterprises to monitor these channels and take action. 
Medallia Zingle. Offers frictionless transactions in real-time. Customers can request products and services in-the-moment as they experience a trip, a stay or a purchase. Zingle is mobile-enabled and accessible anywhere at any time. 
Analytics, Insights and Artificial Intelligence 
Our SaaS platform uses artificial intelligence to analyze all signals captured by customers to drive actions in live time.
Medallia Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics. Uses machine learning to create statistical algorithms to uncover real-time insights, predict future customer outcomes and prescribe actions.
Medallia Theme Explorer/Text Analytics. Medallia Athena Text Analytics uses Natural Language Processing and deep learning to analyze billions of touch points and unstructured text to uncover insights, trends, themes and actions without the need for manual tagging, providing high accuracy and precision across multiple verticals and languages. Theme Explorer automates theme detection, clustering and generation from data sets, AI and deep learning-based technologies.
Journey Analytics. Medallia CX Journeys uncovers the actual paths customers take with their business - including where they break down - providing actionable intelligence to create better experiences for their customers.
CX360. Creates a rich outside-in experience profile for all identified customers providing a 360-degree timeline view of their experiences. Provides deeper insights into customer engagement, model attrition risk, and identify opportunities for development.
Operationalize Customer Experience Reporting and Actions
Our SaaS platform is used broadly across the enterprise to provide personalized insights on customer experience to the right people within the organization to take action.
Medallia Applications. With powerful role-based dashboards, live time insights, alerts and built-in workflow capabilities, these applications connect enterprises to customer and employee signals, allowing everyone from the front line to the C-suite to take targeted actions and improve experiences in live time.
Medallia Mobile. Puts the power of Medallia in the palm of every employee, particularly important for employees on the go. With high adoption, our mobile app empowers frontline employees and managers to facilitate swift and direct action.

Medallia Voices. Tailored for executives to view the direct feedback of customers and employees and take immediate action to drive cultural change. 
Org Sync. Proprietary technology used in our hierarchy management ensures that every employee gets an accurate view of the data tailored to their role and relevant to the customer interactions for their area of responsibility.
We have built a platform that provides a single view of the customer experience and we view employee feedback as an important component. Our employee experience (EX) suite expands the universe of opportunities to capture signals on the employee experience, as well as understand the impact on the customer experience. 
Traditional employee engagement solutions often miss out on ways to collect feedback in the course of an employee’s daily life. Capturing feedback and signals on an ongoing basis in the tools and systems employees are using in their work, yields highly actionable live-time data that can improve employee engagement immediately.
Our robust EX suite is designed to address the demanding requirements of human resource professionals, such as minimum sample sizes and anonymity thresholds, data security and privacy, accessibility, live time dashboards, advanced workflows and integration with human capital management (HCM) and Learning Management Systems. Our EX Suite understands and contextualizes experiences across the entire employee journey and uses employee feedback to identify opportunities and drive action to improve both the employee and customer experience. Our platform also allows customers to engage employees in sharing their ideas and observations about process, tool, and customer experience (CX) improvements right in the context of existing customer experience workflows. This feedback is a rich source of data for employee experience improvement ideas for all parts of the business. Our studies have repeatedly shown that when employees have the opportunity to provide ideas and see their ideas acted on, it leads to higher employee retention and engagement.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our massive ad growing market opportunity by executing on the following growth strategy:
Extend our technological leadership product. We have a strong history of innovation and offer a comprehensive platform that addresses customer and employee experiences for enterprises of all sizes across multiple industries. We intend to continue to invest in new products and features while extending our platform to bring the power of experience management to a broader range of enterprises, industries, geographies and use cases.
Drive cross selling and upselling. We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. The mission-critical nature of our platform and enterprise wide applicability and engagement drives additional upsell and cross sell within enterprises. Our twelve modules provide substantial cross sell opportunity as on average three modules are used by our customers today. 
Drive sales to new customers. As we extend our technology leadership, we also plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow the number of customers. We continue to expand our sales force to pursue large and mid-sized enterprises. In addition, we intend to continue to deepen our opportunity within existing verticals and expand to other verticals.

Broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem. Our partner ecosystem accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform extends our geographic coverage and provides additional implementation resources. We believe our relationship with Integrated Software vendors such as Adobe, Salesforce, ServiceNow and Workday provide our customers with the broadest ecosystem of enterprise systems that integrate and interact to provide excellent customer experiences. We intend to augment and deepen our relationships with our go-to-market partners as well as global and regional services partners.
Continue international expansion. We intend to continue making investments in building our global sales and marketing, service delivery and customer support capabilities to grow our business outside of the United States while delivering the highest quality service to our customers around the world.
Competition 
We pioneered and lead the experience management market and believe that we provide the only comprehensive offering for experience management. We built a platform that addresses the complex experience management needs of enterprise-scale organizations and continue to expand those capabilities to new verticals and enterprises of all sizes. There are other companies that actively compete with us in particular segments of the experience management market. In addition, other established technology companies not currently focused on experience management may expand their services to compete with us. As a result, the competitive landscape is fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect significant competition to continue, both from current competitors as well as new entrants into the market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. 
Our competitors fall into the following categories: 
•in-house solutions or custom-development efforts; 
•survey tools, such as Qualtrics (acquired by SAP) and SurveyMonkey; 
•contact center technology companies, such as Nice and Verint Systems; and 
•full-service consulting firms, such as MaritzCX and Towers Watson. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•breadth of platform capabilities, features, quality, functionality, scalability and design
•scope of signal collection and use of AI to analyze product behavior;
•ability for customers to generate insights and easily act;
•security, privacy and compliance capabilities;
•business impact, including speed and scale of ROI;
•thought leadership, market vision and pace of product innovation;
•strength of artificial intelligence and deep learning capabilities and predictive analytics;
•size and relevance of dataset;
•third party integrations and accessibility across software applications, operating systems and platforms;
•size and sophistication of customer base across verticals and geographies;
•user adoption and engagement;
•quality of user experience, particularly in complex, changing and high-volume environments;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•ease of implementation and flexible deployment options.
Table of Contents

We believe we compete favorably across these factors. However, we realize that many of our current and potential competitors have competitive advantages over us, including:
•greater name and brand recognition;
•deeper product development expertise;
•greater market penetration;
•larger and more established customer bases and relationships;
•larger sales forces and more established partner networks;
•larger marketing budgets; and
•access to significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources.
These large players could move quickly to grow their competitive solutions, either through organic development or acquisitions. At the same time, we believe smaller competitors will continue to develop new solutions that could prove more effective than those offered by us, especially in specific market segments and narrow use cases. In order to continue to lead the experience management market, we will focus on expanding our platform capabilities, investing in our sales and marketing, professional services and partner capabilities, and delivering transformative business impact. 
Our Customers
We measure and track the number of customers because our ability to attract new customers, grow our customer base and retain existing customers helps drive our success and is an important contributor to our revenue growth. We have successfully demonstrated a history of growing our customer base. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of customers with active subscription agreements that run through the current or future period. In situations where a customer has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer.
Our Employees
As of January 31, 2020, we had a total of 1,579 full-time employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Sales and Marketing 
As a leader in the experience management market, we invest substantially in our sales and marketing efforts. Our go-to-market approach is driven by the strength and innovation of our platform, as well as customer demand. We have purpose-built our platform to be equally effective for specific use cases and for holistic, enterprise-wide adoption of experience management. Enterprises often grow their usage of our platform from their initial use cases to numerous business units and expand to use additional products. Our platform has natural network effects that drive expansion across teams and departments. 
Our marketing efforts are focused on promoting our brand, generating awareness of our platform, supporting our community of customers and creating sales leads. The breadth of our platform allows us to market our products throughout an enterprise, and our marketing efforts seek to engage managers at every level. Our marketing initiatives include our city tours and our participation in industry and partner conferences, digital marketing, search engine optimization, case studies and customer testimonials. 
Our sales and marketing expenses were $180.7 million, $138.7 million and $110.0 million for the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For information about our sales and marketing expenses see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Sales and Marketing Expenses" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Partners 
We have a partner ecosystem that helps us market, deliver and extend our platform. We intend to grow this ecosystem to bring the benefits of our platform to more customers around the world. Our partner relationships include:
•Systems integrators and implementation partners. We have an emerging global network of systems integrators and implementation partners that help deliver our platform to various customers around the world. These include global system integrators as well as more specialized geographic and functional providers. 
•Software and technology partners. We work with leading platforms, such as Sales Force, Adobe, Service Now and Workday, to expand our opportunities, extend the benefits of our platform and take advantage of innovations in complementary technologies.

We also partner with a range of leading technology companies to extend the use cases of our platform. These include social networks, ratings and review sites, communication platforms and web analytics providers, among others.
•Consulting partners. We collaborate with a range of consulting partners to help drive outcomes for our customers. These include global management consulting firms that act as strategic advisors to senior executives in corporate, functional and process matters related to experience management. In addition, we work with a broad range of specialized consulting partners that focus on specific domains within experience management.
Research and Development
We have a research and development culture that rapidly and consistently delivers high-quality enhancements to the functionality, performance and usability of our platform. Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for design, development, testing and delivery of our platform and products. We focus our efforts on developing core technologies, as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our platform. 
We have a global workforce with research and development hubs in California, Argentina, Virginia and Israel. We hire skilled engineers, data scientists and other talent from a variety of industries with expertise in developing mission-critical applications for global enterprises. 
As a company, we invest substantial resources in research and development. We have a well-defined technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to our platform that we believe will enhance our ability to generate revenue by broadening the appeal of our platform to potential new customers as well as introducing new opportunities for existing customers. We are also investing to enhance machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence, as well as additional predictive analytics and optimization tools, to address the most complex challenges in the experience management market.
Our research and development expenses were $96.0 million, $86.3 million and $86.4 million for the years ended in January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For information about our research and development expenses see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Research and Development Expenses" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Matters 
We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and internationally, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages (and related traffic data where applicable), intellectual property, human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, import and export controls, immigration laws, federal securities laws and tax

regulations, all of which are continuously evolving and developing. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied to SaaS businesses, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, often are unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
In addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, spam, data storage, data protection, data collection, content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information and private data, and other matters that may be applicable to our business. More countries are enacting and enforcing laws related to the appropriateness of content and enforcing those and other laws by blocking access to services that are found to be out of compliance. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves, as an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and as our solutions are used in a greater number of countries and by additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.” 
Data Privacy and Security 
We prioritize the trust of customers and place a strong emphasis on data privacy and security. Our security program is designed and implemented, throughout our company and our platform, to address the security and compliance requirements of our customers. 
Our information systems and technical infrastructure are hosted within ISO27001, SSAE18 or SOC 2 accredited data centers and we have obtained third-party verification of our security programs across a number of industry standards, including SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001 and ISAE 3000. Service Organization Controls (SOC), are standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal control environments implemented within an organization. We have also achieved FedRAMP Ready status Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board to deliver services to U.S. federal government agencies. 
We have a dedicated team of professionals that focus on application, network and system security, as well as security compliance, training and education and incident response. We build security into our Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) at every stage of our development process. We maintain a documented vulnerability management program that includes periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on servers, workstations, network equipment and applications, and subsequent remediation of vulnerabilities. We also conduct regular internal and external penetration tests and remediate according to severity for any results found.
We encrypt customer data in transit using secure transport layer security cryptographic protocols and encrypt data at rest as well. We use multi-factor authentication and other security controls in order to control access to our resources containing personal data or other confidential information. We offer solutions that meet the accessibility standards of WCAG 2.0 AA and Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as applicable. 
We design our platform, solutions and policies to facilitate compliance with evolving privacy and data security laws and regulations. We post on our website our privacy policy, and we maintain certain other policies and practices relating to data security and concerning our processing, use and disclosure of personal information. We participate in and have certified our compliance with the European Union (EU)-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks with respect to personal data that we collect.
Our commitments under the Privacy Shield Frameworks are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, our publication of our privacy policy and other statements regarding privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if they are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations, 
Table of Contents

including model contract provisions approved by the European Commission relating to any category of personal data and business associate agreements that impose certain obligations and restrictions upon us relating to our handling of protected health information regulated by HIPAA. The privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as their interpretation, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change over time. For example, in 2016 the EU adopted the GDPR, a new regulation governing data privacy, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR contains stringent requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue. Additionally, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Further, in June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, which resulted in the United Kingdom existing the European Union on January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period covering certain matters that will end on December 31, 2020. Brexit could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. A Data Protection Act that substantially implements GDPR has been enacted in the United Kingdom. It remains unclear, however, how United Kingdom (U.K.) data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated. More generally, the various privacy and data security legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our applications or platform. We may need to take additional measures to comply with the changes in our legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data. 
Intellectual Property 
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform and solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
As of January 31, 2020, we had ten issued patents and 21 pending or provisional patent applications. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and solution names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as medallia.com, and similar variations. 
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in California in July 2000. We incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medallia, Inc. in Delaware in December 2009. In October 2010, we merged our California and Delaware corporations and the surviving entity was Medallia, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 575 Market Street, Suite 1850, San Francisco, California 94105, and our telephone number is (650) 321-3000.
