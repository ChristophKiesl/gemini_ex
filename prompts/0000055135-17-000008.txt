ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History and Development of Business
Founded by William R. Kelly in 1946, Kelly Services® has developed innovative workforce solutions for customers in a variety of industries throughout our 70-year history. Our range of solutions has grown steadily over the years to match the changing needs of our customers and to reflect the changing nature of our work.
We have evolved from a United States-based company concentrating primarily on traditional office staffing into a global workforce solutions leader offering a full breadth of specialty services. While ranking as one of the world’s largest scientific staffing providers, we also place professional and technical employees at all levels in engineering, IT, law, healthcare and finance. These specialty services complement our expertise in office services, education, contact center, light industrial and electronic assembly staffing. As the human capital arena has become more complex, we have also developed a talent supply chain management approach to help many of the world’s largest companies plan for and manage their workforce. Innovative solutions supporting this approach span outsourcing, consulting, recruitment, career transition and vendor management services.
Geographic Breadth of Services
Headquartered in Troy, Michigan, Kelly provides workforce solutions to a diversified group of customers in three regions: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). Our customer base spans a variety of industries and includes 95 of the Fortune 100™ companies.
In 2016, we assigned nearly 500,000 temporary employees to a variety of customers around the globe.

Business Objectives
Kelly’s philosophy is rooted in our conviction that our business can and does make a difference on a daily basis — for our customers, in the lives of our employees, in the local communities we serve and in our industry. Our vision is “to provide the world’s best workforce solutions.” We aspire to be a strategic business partner to our customers and strive to assist them in operating more efficient and profitable organizations. Our solutions are customized to benefit any scope or scale customers require. 
As the use of contingent labor, consultants and independent contractors becomes more prevalent and critical to the ongoing success of our customer base, our core competencies are refined to help them realize their respective business objectives. Kelly offers a comprehensive array of outsourcing and consulting services, as well as world-class staffing on a temporary, temporary-to-hire and direct placement basis. Kelly will continue to deliver the strategic expertise our customers need to transform their workforce challenges into opportunities.

Business Operations
Service Marks
We own numerous service marks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Union Community Trademark Office and numerous individual country trademark offices.
Seasonality
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of our customers’ businesses. Demand for staffing services historically has been lower during the first quarter, and typically increases during the remainder of the year.
Working Capital
Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. 
Customers
We are not dependent on any single customer or a limited segment of customers. In 2016, an estimated 51% of total Company revenue was attributed to 100 large customers. Our largest single customer accounted for approximately five percent of total revenue in 2016.
Government Contracts
Although we conduct business under various federal, state, and local government contracts, no single one accounts for more than three percent of total Company revenue in 2016. 
Competition
The worldwide temporary staffing industry is competitive and highly fragmented. In the United States, approximately 100 competitors operate nationally, and approximately 10,000 smaller companies compete in varying degrees at local levels. Additionally, several similar staffing companies compete globally. In 2016, our largest competitors were Adecco S.A., Randstad Holding N.V., ManpowerGroup Inc., Allegis Group and Recruit Holdings. 
Key factors that influence our success are quality of service, price and breadth of service. 
Quality of service is highly dependent on the availability of qualified, competent talent, and our ability to recruit, screen, train, retain and manage a pool of employees who match the skills required by particular customers. During an economic downturn, we must balance competitive pricing pressures with the need to retain a qualified workforce. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense, particularly for office clerical and light industrial personnel, and pricing pressure from customers and competitors continues to be significant. 
Breadth of service, or ability to manage staffing suppliers, has become more critical as customers seek a single supplier to manage all their staffing needs. Kelly’s talent supply chain management approach seeks to address this requirement for our larger customers, enabling us to deliver talent wherever and whenever they need it around the world.
Environmental Concerns
Because we are involved in a service business, federal, state or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not materially impact us. 
Employees
We employ approximately 1,100 people at our corporate headquarters in Troy, Michigan, and approximately 6,400 staff members in our U.S. and international network of branch offices. In 2016, we assigned nearly 500,000 temporary employees to a variety of customers around the globe.
While services may be provided inside the facilities of customers, we remain the employer of record for our temporary employees. We retain responsibility for employee assignments, the employer’s share of all applicable payroll taxes and the administration of the employee’s share of these taxes.
