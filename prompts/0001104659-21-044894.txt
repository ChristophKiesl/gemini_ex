Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on November 9, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a Business Combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents. As described further below, we currently intend to combine with Group Nine Media, Inc. (“Group Nine Media”), a digital media company and the parent company of our Sponsor, concurrent with the completion of our Business Combination. We will not, however, complete Business Combination with only Group Nine Media.
 
On November 9, 2020, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B common stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 or approximately $0.003 per share. On November 19, 2020, we effectuated a 0.8-for-1 reverse split of the Founder Shares, resulting in an aggregate outstanding amount of 5,750,000 Founder Shares. Our Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 100,000 of its Founder Shares to the Company’s independent directors (together with our Sponsor, the “Initial Stockholders”).
 
On January 20, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the “Units”) of the Company, including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock” and, together with the Class B common stock, the “common stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share of Class A common stock. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds to us of $230,000,000. Simultaneously with the IPO Closing Date, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 2,840,000 Warrants to our Sponsor (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, generating gross proceeds to us of $4,260,000. The Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the public Warrants sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants may be physical (cash) or net share (cashless) settled and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The sale of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
 
On the IPO Closing Date, $230,000,000 of the gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were deposited in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trustee”). Of the $4,260,000 held outside of the Trust Account, $2,760,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, $458,681 was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor and advances from our Sponsor and the balance was available to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. Funds held in the Trust Account have been invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred and eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any shares of Class A common stock properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of such shares of Class A common stock if we do not complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the IPO Closing Date and (iii) the redemption of 100% of the shares of Class A common stock if we are unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the IPO Closing Date (subject to applicable law).

On March 8, 2021, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and Warrants included in the Units on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “GNAC” and “GNACW,” respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the National Capital Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “GNACU.”
 
Although we may pursue a target business in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry, sector or geographic region, we initially intend to focus our search on target businesses in the digital media and adjacent industries, including the social media, e-commerce, events, and digital publishing and marketing sectors. We currently intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business in the digital media and/or adjacent industries, as well as on the reputation, significant experience and relationships of our management team to complete a Business Combination. The business executives that comprise our management team are recognized leaders in the digital media industry and have experience in acquiring and operating prominent companies in this domain. In addition, our management team, through long-standing industry relationships, has global access to the operating, venture capital and financial sponsor communities, providing a key portal into a pipeline of potential target acquisition opportunities.

Mr. Sugar is also an early investor in Afterpay, Everlane, Fast, Optimizely, and Roadster, among other companies.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We plan to pursue business combination opportunities with companies operating in the digital media and adjacent industries including, but not limited to, the social media, e-commerce, events, and digital publishing and marketing sectors.
 
We believe the digital media industry continues to benefit from broad consumer trends, including trends relating to:
 

• | Audience: Consumer time spent continues to shift from TV to mobile and social media;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advertising: U.S. digital advertising spend continues to grow at a much faster rate than TV advertising;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platforms: Social and streaming platforms are increasingly valuing and paying for premium content;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Traditional Media: Traditional players are shifting their focus to direct-to-consumer monetization, leaving digital content and advertising opportunities more open for native players; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-commerce: Digital media continues to influence larger swaths of digital purchasing, which has been meaningfully accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the digital media sector is ripe for consolidation, as digital media companies need a scaled platform with efficient portfolio infrastructure to compete in the ecosystem and return value to shareholders in the long-term. Digital media companies that complement organic growth with a robust roll up strategy can generate the audience reach and scale necessary to grow reliable and diversified revenue streams, while simultaneously capitalizing on synergy opportunities to expand margins and profitability. Under the expertise of a centralized management team, such a digital media platform could become the foundation to routinely plug in additional businesses and revenue streams, all the while efficiently expanding margin profiles through operational improvements.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our objective is to create a scalable digital media platform with the infrastructure to continuously support and grow bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions for financial return. We intend to create this platform through the consummation of our Business Combination, targeting businesses with meaningful financial scale and immediately identifiable cost synergies. We then intend to further enhance stockholder value by identifying and completing additional acquisitions, implementing operational improvements, and expanding the targets’ product offerings and geographic footprints.
 
We believe many businesses in the digital media, social media, e-commerce, and events sectors could benefit from access to the public markets, but have thus far been unable to access these markets due to a number of factors, including standalone lack of scale and perceived digital media market volatility. We expect to utilize our management team’s experience in operating and leading successful digital media and e-commerce companies and significant relationships in these sectors to achieve our objective. Our selection process will leverage our management team’s deep and trusted contacts in the digital media and adjacent sectors globally, which we believe will provide us with access to attractive business combination opportunities in these sectors.

As one of the only digital media-focused Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, we believe that we are in a unique position to capitalize on the expected industry consolidation. Our management team has developed a proven roll up thesis through their professional tenure and successful track record of integrating and growing acquired brands and realizing synergies with the Group Nine Media digital platform. In a sector that we believe has value opportunities, one with many sub-scale players looking for larger platforms to join, we intend to build a diverse digital media platform through which to serve as an appealing home for premium brands and intellectual property (“IP”) under a centralized management team. We believe this centralization will allow for the sharing of best practices across brands, while we believe the asset portfolio diversification will provide each individual brand the freedom to operate and grow their categories of expertise. Furthermore, we expect that the implementation of our roll up strategy will provide considerable upside potential through increased advertising revenue from combined go-to market strategies, centralized capabilities for revenue diversification, financial security through additional scale, as well as cost savings from centralized go-to-market and back-office functions.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We intend to identify companies that have compelling growth potential and a combination of the characteristics listed below. We will use these guidelines to evaluate acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria.

· | We intend to focus on businesses that operate category-leading digital media and adjacent sector brands, where we can leverage our management team’s experience as acquirers, operators, and investors and extensive network of industry leaders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to prioritize businesses that exhibit attractive financial metrics, including demonstrated revenue scale and growth and a clear path to profitability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to focus on businesses with which we would have the ability to efficiently unlock revenue synergies, synergies of scale, and/or operational synergies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to focus on businesses that have significant embedded or underexploited expansion opportunities, have been underinvested in by current owners, or where a strategic relationship or business combination with Group Nine Media and additional acquisitions could unlock significant potential synergies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to focus on businesses that own established, trusted, multi-platform IP and have proven success in monetizing IP across multiple channels, including but not limited to linear programming, product licensing, affiliate, and events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to focus on businesses that have identifiable and implementable opportunities for value creation through acquisitions, capital investment in organic growth strategies, or generation of greater operating efficiencies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to focus on businesses that can benefit from a public listing and access to the public capital markets and will be able to effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our Business Combination, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.

Our Business Combination Process and Possible Combination with Group Nine Media
 
Concurrently with our Business Combination, we currently intend to combine with Group Nine Media. The resulting combined company would inherit our NASDAQ listing and its common stock and warrants would be publicly traded. We believe the combination of Group Nine Media and another target business in the digital media and adjacent industries, including the social media, e-commerce, events, and digital publishing and marketing sectors under the Group Nine Media umbrella will allow the resulting combined company to leverage Group Nine Media’s existing licenses, experienced management team and geographic footprint and offer significant synergy and long-term value creation opportunities for our investors and serve as a platform for further growth.
 
We have not entered into any letter of intent or definitive agreement with Group Nine Media, nor have we agreed to valuation or other key terms and conditions with respect to such a possible combination transaction. As a result, even though we intend to combine with Group Nine Media concurrently with the completion of our Business Combination, we cannot provide any assurance that such a merger with Group Nine Media will occur at all, or, if it does, we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or terms thereof. We will not, however, complete a Business Combination with only Group Nine Media. In addition, we will likely not consummate a combination with Group Nine Media if the target business with respect to our Business Combination is not within the digital media and adjacent industries. If we pursue a combination with Group Nine Media concurrently with our Business Combination, a committee of our disinterested directors will negotiate the terms and conditions of such combination (including the valuation of Group Nine Media) on our behalf. Such committee of disinterested directors would also obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the proposed combination with Group Nine Media is fair to our company and our stockholders from a financial point of view. Our public stockholders have the same voting and redemption rights with respect to any combination with Group Nine Media as are applicable to our Business Combination and described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, if we combine with Group Nine Media concurrently with our Business Combination, our Sponsor intends to forfeit all the Founder Shares held by it in connection with the consummation of such business combination.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business for our Business Combination, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. Similar to our approach with respect to a potential combination with Group Nine Media, in the event we seek to complete our Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, we, or a committee of disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member or FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our Business Combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Members of our management team and certain of our directors directly or indirectly own Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following our Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to our Business Combination.
 
In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she honors these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and may determine to only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our Business Combination, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided to any such officers and directors. We do not have any plan for any waiver of the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors post-business combination.

Further, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Business Combination
 
NASDAQ listing rules require that our Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Business Combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We anticipate structuring our Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business or businesses in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target business and us in the Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our Business Combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. Subject to the foregoing, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations, or with Group Nine Media alone. If we combine with Group Nine Media concurrently with our Business Combination, we will not include the fair market value of Group Nine Media for purposes of satisfying the 80% of net assets test.
 
In connection with our Public Offering, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Business Combination.

Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Our executive offices are located at 568 Broadway, Floor 10, New York, NY 10012 and our telephone number is (646) 786-1980. Our website address is www.gnacinc.com.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants initially in the amount of $220,110,000 assuming no redemptions and payment of Code Advisors LLC’s deferred initial underwriting commission upon consummation of the business combination and after payment of $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

Effecting our Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our Business Combination. We may seek to complete our Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Business Combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had not selected any business combination target and we had not, nor has anyone on our behalf, had any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Business Combination using the proceeds of such offerings rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account.
 
In the case of Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Sources of Target Business
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. We may engage the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our Sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated Business Combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of Business Combination candidate.
 
8


We are not prohibited from pursuing Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or their respective affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or their respective affiliates, we, or a committee of disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our Business Combination is fair to our company and our stockholders from a financial point of view. In addition, if we combine with Group Nine Media concurrently with our Business Combination, we will obtain a fairness opinion with respect to such merger. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Business Combination
 
NASDAQ listing rules require that our Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Business Combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. Our Board will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Business Combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. Even though our Board will rely on generally accepted standards, our Board will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the Board in evaluating the fair market value of the target business or businesses. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from another entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Business Combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. If we combine with Group Nine Media concurrently with our Business Combination, we will not include the fair market value of Group Nine Media for purposes of satisfying the 80% of net assets test.
 
In any case, we will only complete Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Business Combination.
 
To the extent we effect our Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
9


In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding Business Combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Business Combination and any merger with Group Nine Media, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.
 
Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Business Combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors or officers will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Business Combination.
 
Following our Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 
10



Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our Business Combination if, for example:
 

· | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ listing rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

· | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of public shares such persons may purchase. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our Business Combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which will require insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
11


In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our Business Combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our Business Combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions prior to completion of our Business Combination.
 
The purpose of such purchases could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of our Business Combination or (2) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Business Combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares unless such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted except to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

Redemption Rights For Public Stockholders Upon Completion of a Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. As the Public Offering did not close until January 20, 2021, the Trust Account was not funded as of December 31, 2020. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Business Combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Business Combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our Business Combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, upon consummation of a Business Combination and after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Business Combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such Business Combination, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
13



· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NASDAQ listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Business Combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our Business Combination. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our Business Combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Business Combination and after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our Business Combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (defined below), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Business Combination.
 
14


Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve our Business Combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the Business Combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their Business Combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against the proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional redemption rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Business Combination.
 
15


If our Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination until 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or during any Extension Period.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering to complete our Business Combination. If we have not completed our Business Combination within such 24-month period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Business Combination within the prescribed time period.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or during any Extension Period. However, if our Sponsor, officers and directors acquire public shares in or after our Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our Business Combination within the allotted 24-month time period.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (a) in the case of our Business Combination, upon consummation of such Business Combination and after payment of the deferred underwriting commission or (b) in the case of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, upon such amendment (in each case so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is being exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above) we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes we may request the Trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
16


If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—If third parties (including Code Advisors LLC in respect of its deferred initial underwriting commissions) bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. The underwriters of our Public Offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.
 
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our Public Offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor, which is a newly formed entity, has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Given that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those indemnification obligations. Furthermore, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.” None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
17


In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our disinterested directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our disinterested directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our disinterested directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the disinterested directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the disinterested directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—If third parties (including Code Advisors LLC in respect of its deferred initial underwriting commissions) bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to the proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants (after payment of offering expenses), with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or during any Extension Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or during any Extension Period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
18


Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. The underwriters of our Public Offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay our taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our Board and us to claims of punitive damages.”
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our Business Combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Public stockholders who do not exercise their redemption rights in connection with such an amendment to our certificate of incorporation would still have redemption rights in connection with any other applicable amendment to our certificate of incorporation and a subsequent business combination to the extent they are then public stockholders. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Business Combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with our Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. Holders of Warrants will not have any rights of proceeds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Warrants.
 
19


Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Public Offering which apply to us until the consummation of our Business Combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

· | prior to the consummation of our Business Combination, we shall either: (1) seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, without voting, and, if they do vote, independent of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable); or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we will consummate our Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Business Combination and after payment of the deferred underwriting commission, and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination at a duly held stockholders meeting;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if our Business Combination is not consummated within 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prior to our Business Combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the Trust Account or (2) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any Business Combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of at least 65% of our outstanding common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Business Combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our Business Combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions, as well as affiliates of Group Nine Media. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating Business Combination.
 
20


Conflicts of Interest
 
Certain of our directors and officers and affiliates of Group Nine Media and our Sponsor have duties to various entities. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities in the same industries and sectors as we may target for our Business Combination. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities.
 
In addition, investment ideas generated within our Sponsor and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for both us and for current or future entities managed by our directors, officers or affiliates of our Sponsor and may be directed to such entity rather than to us. As employees of Group Nine Media or its affiliates, certain members of the management team are and in the future will be involved in the formation of and offerings by these companies as well as the identification, acquisition and management of investments by such companies. The letter agreements entered into with our officers will not restrict them from undertaking any such activities. Our CEO and Chairman Ben Lerer is also President and a director of Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp., another blank check company. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors may in the future, participate in the formation of, become an officer or director of, invest in, or otherwise become associated with any other blank check company prior to completion of our Business Combination.
 
Additionally, we may pursue a combination with a target in which Group Nine Media’s affiliates may have direct or indirect exposure or that is an operating company directly or indirectly held by a Group Nine Media affiliate. Conflicts may arise from Group Nine Media’s sponsorship of our company and its provision of services both to us and to its affiliates, including the conflict that Group Nine Media and its affiliates may receive material economic benefits as a result of a business combination with a target in which a Group Nine Media affiliate has a direct or indirect investment. In performing services for other affiliates, Group Nine Media may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us.
 
Our key personnel, who are affiliated with Group Nine Media, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating potential business combinations if Group Nine Media or its affiliates have direct or indirect exposure to the target of such potential business combination and may realize material economic benefits in connection with the corporation’s completion of a business combination with such target. In additional, such personnel may have a conflict of interest with conducting diligence on Group Nine Media and evaluating Group Nine Media as a potential acquisition.
 
As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between our officers’ fiduciary and contractual obligations to these companies, including Group Nine Media and its affiliates, and our officers’ obligations to us. None of the members of our management team who are also employed by Group Nine Media, our Sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Our management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or employees of Group Nine Media, our Sponsor or their affiliates in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future investment vehicles of our Sponsor or its affiliates, including other blank-check companies, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities, including Group Nine Media or its affiliates, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Additionally, our CEO and Chairman Ben Lerer is also President and a director of Lerer Hippeau Acquisition Corp., another blank check company. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties to us under Delaware law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Business Combination.
 
21


Indemnity
 
Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Given that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those indemnification obligations. Furthermore, we have not asked our Sponsor, which is a newly formed entity, to reserve for such obligations. We believe the likelihood of our Sponsor having to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.”
Employees
 
We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our Units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
22


We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
