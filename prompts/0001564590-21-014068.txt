Item 1. Business
Overview
 J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. (also referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) owns and operates through its subsidiaries complementary upscale dining restaurants including: J. Alexander’s, Redlands Grill, Overland Park Grill, Merus Grill and Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill (“Stoney River”). For 30 years, J. Alexander’s guests have enjoyed a contemporary American menu, polished service and an attractive ambiance. In February 2013, our team brought our quality and professionalism to the steakhouse category with the addition of the Stoney River concept. Stoney River provides “white tablecloth” service and food quality in a casual atmosphere at a competitive price. Our Redlands Grill concept offers guests a different version of our contemporary American menu and a distinct architectural design and feel. In 2018, we successfully converted one of our previous J. Alexander’s locations in Kansas to the Overland Park Grill which continues to offer a contemporary American menu.  In 2019, we opened Merus Grill in Houston, Texas, with a menu that features a wide selection of American classics including prime rib of beef, steaks, fresh seafood, premium sandwiches and entrée salads served in a uniquely designed environment that also includes original artwork.  During 2020, in response to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, the Company implemented a robust carry-out program which continues to offer its classic menu items as well as new offerings of “Family Packs” and other specialty items that lend themselves to off‑premise consumption.
 For additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading “Risks Related to COVID-19, Health Epidemics and Food Safety” as well as “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the heading “Recent Developments and Trends Impacting our Business.”
 By offering a collection of restaurants and utilizing unique non-standardized architecture and specialized menus, we believe we are positioned to continue to grow our overall restaurant business in an efficient manner in urban and affluent suburban areas. We want each of our restaurants to be perceived by our guests as a locally managed, stand-alone dining experience. This differentiation permits us to successfully operate multiple restaurants in the same geographic market and avoid being perceived as a “chain.” If this strategy continues to prove successful, we may expand beyond our current existing concepts in the future.
 While each restaurant concept operates under a unique trade name, each of our restaurants is identified as a “J. Alexander’s Holdings Restaurant.” As of January 3, 2021, we operated a total of 46 locations across 16 states.
 We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year calendar ending on the Sunday closest to December 31, and each quarter typically consists of 13 weeks.  For purposes of this Annual Report, references to 2020 generally refer to our fiscal year 2020, which ended on January 3, 2021 and includes results for 53 weeks of operations.  Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 each included 52 weeks of operations.
 The locations currently operating or that have operated under the names Redlands Grill, Overland Park Grill, Lyndhurst Grill (which closed in fiscal 2020) and Merus Grill have been included with the J. Alexander’s locations in the disclosures of key operating metrics such as average weekly sales, average weekly same store sales, average check and other applicable disclosures, and are collectively referred to herein as “J. Alexander’s / Grill” restaurants.
 During the second quarter of 2020, the Company made the decision not to reopen the Lyndhurst Grill location in Cleveland, Ohio, after a review of its projected and historical financial performance. This location was required to be closed in mid-March 2020 due to COVID-19 related traffic limitations unique to that specific restaurant and remained closed.  The Company completed the sale of the remaining long-lived assets at this location, including the land and building, during the third quarter of 2020.
 History and Corporate Structure
 The first J. Alexander’s restaurant opened in 1991 in Nashville, Tennessee. From 1991 to 2012, J. Alexander’s restaurants were owned and operated by J. Alexander’s Corporation (“JAC”), the predecessor to, our subsidiary, J. Alexander’s, LLC. As of March 17, 2021, we operated 19 J. Alexander’s restaurants located in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. 
 Stoney River was founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1996.  From 2000 until 2012, Stoney River was owned and operated by O’Charley’s, Inc., a multi-concept restaurant company that was acquired in April 2012 by affiliates of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”).  In September 2012, JAC was acquired by then Fidelity National Financial Ventures, LLC (“FNFV,” and now conducting business independently as Cannae Holdings, Inc., or “Cannae”), a former wholly owned subsidiary of FNF, and in February 2013, 
 3


ownership of Stoney River Management Company, LLC and its subsidiaries and related restaurant assets were transferred to J. Alexander’s Holdings, LLC, then a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of FNFV and the principal holding company for the J. Alexander’s restaurant operations. As of March 17, 2021, we operated 13 Stoney River restaurants located in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina and Tennessee.
 Redlands Grill is a restaurant concept that we launched in the first quarter of 2015 and expanded through the conversion of 12 J. Alexander’s restaurants during the course of fiscal years 2015 and 2016. As of March 17, 2021, we operated 12 Redlands Grill restaurants located in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.  We plan to open our first ground‑up build of a Redlands Grill in San Antonio, Texas, at the end of March 2021.
 As noted above, the Company also operates an Overland Park Grill in Overland Park, Kansas and a Merus Grill in Houston, Texas as of March 17, 2021.
 J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Tennessee on August 15, 2014. Following certain internal restructuring transactions, J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. became the ultimate parent holding company for J. Alexander’s Holdings, LLC’s assets and operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the “Spin-off” distribution (the “Spin-off”) by FNF of all shares of the Company’s common stock owned by FNF to all holders of FNF’s FNFV Group common stock, as it was known at the time of the Spin-off.
 Restaurant Positioning Strategy 
 Our business plan has evolved over time to include a collection of restaurants dedicated to providing guests with what we believe to be the highest quality of food, levels of professional service and a comfortable ambiance in each of the markets being served. Although we operate distinct concepts, we identify all our restaurants as a “J. Alexander’s Holdings Restaurant.” We believe our restaurant branding strategy enhances our ability to expand feature menu offerings available to guests on a seasonal or rotational basis and facilitate expansion into certain markets which may already have one of our restaurants. We also believe that having multiple concepts will allow us to expand in markets that might not otherwise have been considered viable for expansion opportunities. Additionally, by further developing our carry-out program in each of our restaurant locations with the same attention to detail taken in our dining rooms, we believe we can both increase frequency of usage by our existing loyal guests and reach a wider array of guests who may prefer this level of service when selecting their dining options.
 In the upscale segment of the restaurant industry, we believe a “chain” classification is generally perceived negatively. We determined that in order to compete with upscale independent restaurants we would need to offer the service, food quality and building design standards that more resemble an independently owned restaurant than a national chain restaurant group. We differentiate ourselves from chain restaurants by ensuring that no two restaurants have the exact same menu, emphasizing feature items which are typically changed on a daily basis, and executing a 95 percent made-from-scratch menu. In addition, the architecture of each of our restaurants is designed to meet the needs of individual markets and create a unique dining experience at each location.
 In further execution of this strategy, we have transitioned 12 previous J. Alexander’s locations to a Redlands Grill and one location to Overland Park Grill, and we anticipate that we could transition additional locations to a Redlands Grill, a Merus Grill, or any of our other existing or newly established trademarked names in the future. The benefits of converting existing J. Alexander’s restaurants to a different concept name are twofold. In larger metropolitan areas and midsize markets, we can operate an additional restaurant, and, in other markets, conversions will reduce the number of J. Alexander’s national locations. This multiple concept strategy will allow us to expand the number of units we operate without directly competing with ourselves in major metropolitan markets and offer our consumers a differentiated look and feel while preserving the made-from-scratch and upscale service our guests have come to expect. 
 The objective of our strategy is to have less of a chain image and allow us to compete more effectively with independently owned upscale American-style dining restaurants. Determining the specific number of restaurants that should operate under the name J. Alexander’s, Redlands Grill, Stoney River or another concept name requires ongoing evaluation, which we expect to refine over time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) defines any restaurant with 20 or more locations as being a chain and requires such restaurants to post the caloric content of each menu item. To the extent that this law grouped us with national fast food and casual dining restaurants, it affirmed our belief that being identified as a chain is inconsistent with our upscale concept.

Our Restaurants
 J. Alexander’s / Grill
 The first J. Alexander’s restaurant was opened in 1991 in Nashville, Tennessee. Since its inception, J. Alexander’s has been a quality-focused upscale dining restaurant offering a contemporary American menu in a lively environment with attentive, courteous and professional service. J. Alexander’s menu centers around made-from-scratch items with a focus on fresh ingredients providing guests a variety of high-quality menu options. We believe J. Alexander’s restaurants have a modest table to server ratio which, when coupled with our intensive training program and team approach to table service, allows our servers to provide better, more detail-oriented and attentive service. As of March 17, 2021, we had 19 J. Alexander’s locations in 11 states.
 The J. Alexander’s menu features prime rib of beef; hardwood-grilled steaks, seafood and chicken; pasta; salads; soups; and assorted sandwiches, appetizers and desserts. We place special emphasis on high quality and sustainable seafood and daily specials which enable us to efficiently take advantage of variances in food costs. We also incorporate local “farm-to-table” produce to provide menu variety to our guests. As a part of our commitment to quality, the majority of our soups, sauces, salsa, salad dressings and desserts are made daily from scratch; our steaks are cut in house; and our beef, chicken, seafood and select vegetable offerings are grilled over a genuine hardwood fire or, in selected locations, in a 1600-degree Montague® broiler. All of our steaks are U.S.D.A. choice beef (or higher) with a targeted aging of 21 to 38 days. We use only Certified Angus Beef ® for all strip steaks and chuck rolls.  We grind chuck fresh daily for our hand-pattied burgers. Our carry-out program allows us to provide guests with some of their favorite menu items as well as new family-style meals, such as lasagna, baby back ribs, seared salmon, whole carrot cake, bulk side items and cook-at-home hand-cut steaks with the same high-quality ingredients served in our dining rooms. The J. Alexander’s food menu is complemented by a comprehensive wine list that offers familiar varietals.
 Redlands Grill offers a broad contemporary American cuisine featuring expanded menu offerings on a seasonal or rotational basis. We anticipate that over time the Redlands Grill concept will have more sushi and contemporary products like in-restaurant prepared flatbreads compared to a J. Alexander’s Restaurant which will emphasize center of the plate proteins. Redlands Grill offers a brunch menu in locations that can support a brunch program. For example, the Redlands Grill on West End Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee features a high-quality sushi program, jumbo fried shrimp, shrimp louie entrée salad, French press coffee service and unique desserts such as a “”Powerful Stuff”, a triple-layered ice cream cake offering, and numerous other feature items not offered in all J. Alexander’s locations. On Sundays, Redlands Grill offers a wide selection of made-from-scratch brunch items including Belgian waffles, eggs benedict, huevos ranchero, quiche, omelets and lemon and ricotta hotcakes. The Redlands Grill on West End also has a more extensive wine program than a typical J. Alexander’s Restaurant, with an award-winning wine program that offers numerous wines by the glass and maintains over 140 bottles. Each restaurant is open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. Menu items are priced similarly to those at J. Alexander’s restaurants. As of March 17, 2021, we operated 12 Redlands Grill restaurants in eight states.
 The Company also operates an Overland Park Grill in Overland Park, Kansas, and a Merus Grill in Houston, Texas, as of March 17, 2021. Menus at these locations feature a wide selection of American classics including prime rib of beef, steaks, fresh seafood, premium sandwiches and entrée salads served in uniquely designed environments that also include original artwork.
 J. Alexander’s / Grill restaurants are open for lunch and dinner, seven days a week. The breadth of our menu offering helps generate significant traffic at both lunch and dinner.  Entrées range in price from approximately $14.00 to $41.00, while appetizers and entrée salads range from approximately $7.00 to $22.00. In 2020, lunch and dinner represented approximately 33% and 67% of sales, respectively. Alcohol was 16% of sales for the same period. Off-premise sales were approximately 18.1% of net sales in 2020. Our average unit volumes were approximately $4,340 in 2020 compared to $5,800 in 2019 reflecting the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020. Our highest volume restaurant exceeded $8,100 in 2020 annual sales. Our average weekly same store sales for 2020 were $83,200 compared to $113,800 in 2019 again reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on guest traffic and net sales in 2020. The average check for J. Alexander’s / Grill restaurants in 2020 was $33.23.
 Architecturally, J. Alexander’s / Grill restaurants employ contemporary designs and unique features contributing to a high-end, upscale environment. Each J. Alexander’s / Grill location incorporates natural materials such as stone and wood and, for much of our history, has been craftsman-style. Our J. Alexander’s / Grill restaurants include open floor plans and, in some cases, exposed structural steel, in each case giving the restaurants a contemporary feel. The architectural design varies from location to location depending on the space available, and several locations include unique attributes such as fire pits or patios. All locations feature original artwork, full bars and open kitchens. We believe this gives our restaurants a boutique, unchained feel which is an important facet of our design and site strategy. J. Alexander’s / Grill locations range in size from 6,900 to 9,000 square feet and can accommodate up to 220 guests, on average, at full capacity without the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions.

Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill
 Stoney River is an upscale steakhouse restaurant that seeks to provide the quality and service of fine dining steakhouses at a lower price point. Stoney River offers a high-quality steakhouse menu and a broad selection of non-steak entrées with an emphasis on featured items. We believe Stoney River restaurants have a modest table to server ratio in line with that of “white tablecloth” steakhouses. This, coupled with our intensive training program and team approach to table service, allows our servers to provide highly attentive service. As of March 17, 2021, we had 13 Stoney River restaurants in eight states.  
 Stoney River offers a high-quality steakhouse menu, but unlike menus of many of its more expensive competitors, the menu is not à la carte, and a side item is included with all filets and steaks. Stoney River’s menu features its popular Coffee-Cured Filet Mignon, as well as other U.S.D.A. choice (or higher) aged beef options. Particularly when compared to steakhouse competitors, Stoney River places special emphasis on a broad selection of steak alternatives including baby back ribs, ahi tuna, pasta, chicken, salmon and other popular non-steak dishes. Although beef accounts for a significant portion of our entrée sales, Stoney River also offers an extensive wine list, including high quality and unique selections. The quality of the beef and inclusion of a side item offers our guests a premium offering at a more reasonable price than many steakhouse competitors. Our carry-out program at Stoney River also offers guests access to classic menu items as well as unique Family Packs, such as our famous steak and biscuits, crispy bistro chicken, seared salmon, steak salad and “Grill at Home” steak Family Packs as well as individual hand-cut steaks in our Butchershop and whole loins of beef.
 Each restaurant is open for dinner seven days a week, and several are open for lunch or Sunday brunch. Entrées range in price from approximately $14.00 to $46.00, and appetizers and entrée salads range in price from approximately $9.00 to $22.00. Each location has a full bar, and alcohol and wine represented approximately 17% of sales in 2020. Off-premise sales accounted for 16.0% of net sales in 2020. Our average unit volumes were approximately $3,000 in 2020 compared to $4,200 in 2019 reflecting the impact of COVID-19 at our Stoney River locations. Our highest volume restaurant exceeded $4,500 in 2020 annual sales.  Our average weekly same store sales for 2020 were $57,200, and for 2019 were $79,800 again reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on guest traffic and net sales in 2020. During 2020, the average check for Stoney River was $42.05. Stoney River’s basic restaurant design is modeled after an elite and modern mountain lodge-style building. As we executed our recent remodeling program, we elevated the decor to a more updated contemporary feel. Stoney River locations range in size from 6,400 to 8,000 square feet and can accommodate up to 260 guests on average, including private dining spaces. Most locations offer private dining as an option, and private dining has historically accounted for approximately 6.0% of net sales prior to COVID-19 related impacts in 2020. Going forward, we anticipate that each new Stoney River location will operate as a lunch and dinner service restaurant.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 Over the 30-year operating history of our restaurants, we have developed and refined the following strengths: 
 Distinct Yet Complementary Concepts 
 Our restaurant concepts have more than 45 years of combined history, strong brand value and exceptional guest loyalty in their core markets. They blend what we believe are the best attributes of fine and casual dining: a focus on high quality food made with fresh ingredients in a scratch kitchen, exceptional service, diverse menus and individualized interior and exterior design unique to each community. Each restaurant has a distinct identity, and the differentiation in menu and restaurant design is substantial enough that they can successfully operate in the same markets or retail locations. 
 Over time, we anticipate that we will continue to grow with our multi-concept strategy. Each restaurant concept will have up to 19 restaurants competing in the upscale casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. All of our restaurants will take advantage of our professional service system, made-from-scratch high-quality menu items and our unique architectural designs supported by upscale ambiance. We believe that this strategy will increase our national footprint and overall competitive advantage. 
 Delivering a Superior Dining Experience with the Highest Quality Service at a Reasonable Price Point 
 Our restaurants provide a broad range of high-quality menu items that are intended to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, and which are served by a courteous, professional and well-trained wait-staff. We provide this high-end experience at a reasonable and attractive price point, which we believe helps us cultivate long-term, loyal and highly satisfied guests who place a premium on the price-value relationship that our restaurants offer. 
 Premium, Freshly Made Cuisine. All of our restaurants are committed to preparing high quality food from innovative menus. We are selective in our choice of ingredients and menu offerings, including the grades of beef and the freshness of seafood and vegetables we serve. Substantially all protein and vegetable offerings are delivered fresh to our restaurants and are not frozen in 
 6


transport or in storage prior to being served and are predominantly preservative and additive-free. We offer made-to-order items prepared from scratch, with approximately 95% of our items, including stocks, sauces and desserts, made in-house. Our food menu is complemented by comprehensive wine lists that offer familiar varietals. While each restaurant’s menu has its own distinctive profile, we strive to continuously innovate with new recipes and ingredients and local “farm-to-table” produce to provide specials and limited time featured items to keep the experience new and interesting for our guests. All of our new menu items are developed through a process designed to meet our high standards. An important component of the quality assurance system is the preparation of taste plates. Within each restaurant, menu items are taste-tested daily by a manager to ensure that only the highest quality, properly prepared food meeting or exceeding our specifications is served in each restaurant. A key position in each restaurant is the Quality Control coordinator (“QC”). This position is always staffed by a fully trained manager who inspects every plate of food before it is served to our guests. We believe that the QC inspection by a member of management is a significant and vital factor in maintaining consistent, high food quality. 
 Outstanding Service. We believe that prompt, courteous and efficient service delivered by a knowledgeable staff is an integral component of our restaurants. We enforce strict guidelines on professional appearance for servers as well as timeliness of service. To ensure that all staff are working together to achieve the highest guest satisfaction we employ a modest table to server ratio which, when coupled with team serving by a dedicated staff, we believe provides our guests exceptional service. 
 Inviting, Sophisticated and Safe Experience. We strive to create an immersive experience for our guests through both our outstanding food and beverage options as well as great attention to enhancing the experience of each of the five senses. Our restaurants use a variety of architectural designs and building finishes to provide guests with beautiful, upscale décor with contemporary and timeless finishes. We are proactive with our repair and maintenance program in all locations, in an attempt to ensure that no restaurant ever looks “highly trafficked” or dated and to reduce the need for periodic remodels to reimage a location to acceptable standards. We also curate a sophisticated background music playlist for each location, and we select our china and silverware to have the quality appearance and feel in the guests' hands that they have come to expect when dining with us. We also take great care to ensure that our guests and our employees feel safe and comfortable while dining or working in one of our restaurants especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made recent and ongoing investments to maintain our guests' health and safety in our restaurants including through the installation of pub and booth partitions and the establishment and expansion of outdoor dining facilities. We have also invested in technology to facilitate touchless menus and contactless payment options for our guests. Additionally, we have made investments in our team members by providing training on the use of personal protective equipment and proper sanitation protocols. We remain committed to continually enhancing the guest experience and maintaining a clean, safe and inviting atmosphere in each of our restaurants.
Attractive Unit Economics and Consistent Execution 
 We believe that we have a long-standing track record of consistently producing high average weekly sales and average unit sales volumes and have proven the viability of our restaurants in multiple markets and regions. Since we began operating Stoney River, we have been able to increase the average weekly sales at the Stoney River restaurants, with exception of the COVID-19 impact in 2020, even while implementing significant operational improvements and remodeling locations. We believe that additional remodels and potential expansions of locations in each of our concepts will contribute to increases in average weekly same store sales.
Strong Cultural Focus on Continuous Training 
 We believe that our stringent employee hiring standards, coupled with our extensive and continuous training programs for all employees, contribute to providing outstanding service to our guests at each of our restaurants. We prefer to promote our restaurant general managers and regional management from within the organization, and approximately 60% of those roles are currently filled by individuals promoted from within. We believe that this helps to ensure that our unique focus and culture of excellent service are thoroughly disseminated throughout our restaurants. We seek to hire management prospects from top culinary programs nationwide and to train them in our service levels and processes. It can take three to five years of experience in our system for a management trainee to be qualified for promotion to general manager in one of our locations. We also provide ongoing training opportunities for our back of the house and kitchen staff to ensure they maintain and improve their skills and learn how best to prepare our current and new menu items.
Sophisticated and Scalable Back Office and Operations 
 We have been in operation for 30 years and have a long history of operating high-volume restaurants. We employ a sophisticated menu development process that has successfully created replicable recipes with a focus on maximizing gross margin by highly efficient use of perishable food inventories to create unique and inviting recipes. Our recipes are developed to use premium ingredients sourced from long standing relationships with high quality vendors. Most of our protein purchases are negotiated directly 
 7


with our suppliers. We believe this not only reduces overall food costs but enables us to enforce strict standards on orders and adherence to the detailed instruction manual we provide to producers. Because we deal directly with producers, we are also able to take advantage of seasonal products and provide “farm-to-table” options that change with the seasons and ingredient availability through our unique “featured items” menu. Direct relationships with vendors also provide us cost and flexibility advantages that may not be available from third party distributors. We also have a shared services model for our back-office that centralizes certain functionality at our corporate headquarters and leverages advanced systems platforms. Services shared between our concepts include staff training, real estate development, purchasing, human resources, information technology and finance and accounting, further contributing to the complementary nature of our concepts. We believe that the teams and technology we have put in place to manage these functions, and other non-restaurant operations functions are capable of managing the number of restaurants in our current growth plan with limited additional hires.
 From high quality food vendors to technology and maintenance vendors, we believe that we have developed long-term relationships with a highly sophisticated team of vendors capable of effectively servicing our needs as we execute our growth plan. The quality and depth of both our vendor relationships and our shared services have resulted in a scalable platform with the bench strength to support our planned growth with limited adjustments.
 Experienced Management Team 
 We are led by a management team with significant experience in all aspects of restaurant operations. Our experienced team of industry veterans at the executive level has an average of approximately 25 years of restaurant experience, and our 46 general managers, as of January 3, 2021, have an average tenure of approximately 13 years with the Company.
Our Growth Strategies 
 Although the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business in 2020, we believe that a strong demand still exists for the products and services that we offer to our guests as evidenced by the sales levels that we experienced during periods of fiscal 2020 when government-mandated capacity restrictions were eased. We believe that once effective vaccines become widely available to the general public, consumer confidence strengthens and governmental capacity restrictions are alleviated, our restaurants will return to serving full dining rooms, while continuing to provide a robust carry-out service. We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business, strengthen our competitive position and enhance our restaurants through the implementation of the following strategies: 
Deliver Consistent Same Store Sales 
 We believe that we will be able to generate annual same store sales growth on a long-term, consistent basis by providing an attractive price/value proposition for our guests through excellent service in an upscale environment. We continually focus on delivering freshly prepared, contemporary American cuisine to our guests, with exceptional quality and service at a reasonable price point. Though the core menu at each restaurant is consistent and familiar to our guests, we regularly develop and deploy new menu items as well as limited-time featured food and drink offerings that are rotated on a weekly basis. As a result, we are able to adapt to changing consumer tastes and product availability and incorporate local offerings to reinforce our boutique restaurant feel. We continue to explore ways to increase the number of occasions and flexibility of dining options for our guests, including the addition of Sunday brunch at select restaurants, outdoor dining options and additional carry-out options both for celebrations and everyday use.  In addition, we operate a program of continuous investment in all of our locations to maintain our store images at the highest level, and target spending $75 to $100 per year in maintenance capital expenditures per restaurant.
Pursue Disciplined New Restaurant Growth in Target Markets in the Long-Term
 We believe each of our concepts has significant growth potential and that there are significant opportunities to grow our concepts on a nationwide basis in both existing and new markets where we believe we can generate attractive unit economics. 
 Although we slowed development during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe it to be in the Company’s best long-term interest to continue to evaluate potential future sites. We are constantly evaluating potential sites for new restaurant openings and currently have many locations in a variety of separate markets under various stages of review and development. We believe that having several sites under review at any one time is necessary in order to meet our development goals. In our experience, sites under analysis often will not result in a new restaurant location for any number of reasons, including the delay or cancelation of larger development projects on which a future restaurant may depend, the loss of potential site locations to competitors or our ultimate determination that a site under review is not appropriate for one of our restaurants. We believe that the number of available and potential sites under review by us, the anticipated costs of opening a new restaurant location and our expected capital resources will 
 8


support up to four new store openings annually beginning in 2022. However, our ability to open any particular number of restaurants in any calendar year is dependent upon many factors, risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19, beyond our control as discussed more fully elsewhere in this Annual Report under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.  The most recent restaurant opening was a Merus Grill restaurant in Houston, Texas, during November 2019.  In 2021, the Company expects to open a Redlands Grill in San Antonio, Texas, at the end of March and a J. Alexander’s restaurant in Madison, Alabama, early in the fourth quarter.
 We expect that the development of our Redlands Grill and other concepts will further accelerate growth by allowing us to expand into certain markets which currently have a J. Alexander’s and/or Stoney River restaurant and that might not otherwise have been considered viable for expansion opportunities.
 Improve Margins and Leverage Infrastructure 
 We believe that our corporate infrastructure and technology can support a restaurant base greater than our existing footprint.  We have made recent significant investments in updated technology platforms that will enable greater visibility into the real-time operations of each restaurant and are expected to result in efficiencies related to both food and beverage costs as well as labor. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive greater efficiencies in our supply chain and leverage our technology and existing support infrastructure to drive sales and enhance margins and we anticipate that, over time, general and administrative expenses will grow at a slower rate than our restaurant base and net sales.
Further Development of our Carry-out Program
 In response to the required dining room closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly shifted our service model to a carry-out only platform. Since our restaurants have been able to begin welcoming guests for dine-in service once again, we have continued to offer our guests ordering carry-out options to be picked up inside of our restaurants or via curbside service and in certain markets to be delivered by our online ordering platform provider. We believe that we have developed a robust and attractive carry-out program that allows us to serve our long-time guests on a more frequent basis as well as attract new guests who prefer the carry-out service model. Our carry-out model allows us to provide guests with some of their favorite menu items as well as offer new family-style meals (offering a complete meal for larger parties often including a salad, entrée, side items and dessert), and butcher shop sales of cook at home hand-cut steaks all with the same high-quality ingredients served in our dining rooms at an attractive price point. We also offer cocktails and bottles of wine for off-premise consumption where permitted by local law. We have increased our digital marketing and email campaigns to drive guest awareness of our carry-out program and invested in our online ordering platform and third-party relationships.
Restaurant Design and Site Selection Process 
 Site Selection 
 We have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process incorporating management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. We are continuously evaluating restaurants in both new and existing markets, and we will seek to expand in selected regions throughout the U.S. We identify and work with local brokers to conduct preliminary research regarding each potential market and location. The preliminary research includes an analysis of traffic patterns, parking, access, demographic characteristics, population density, level of affluence, consumer attitudes or preferences and current or expected co-retail and restaurant tenants. The brokers then present potential sites to our real estate department. If our financial criteria for the site are satisfied, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer visit the site, and once approved, our management negotiates the lease. 
 For each of our restaurants, our key site criterion is that the population within a five-mile radius has a high concentration of our targeted guests, which includes individuals in the upper income demographic of major metropolitan areas that dine out frequently. In addition, we target high concentrations of retail and upscale office developments to support our lunch business. We also prefer locations with high visibility and ample parking spaces.
 Restaurant Design 
 We do not have a standard prototype for each restaurant with respect to size, location or layout, which enables us to be flexible in our real estate selection process. This allows us to use a combination of new builds and conversions for our new locations. Our restaurants are generally free-standing structures using a variety of interior and exterior finishes and materials which have been developed to allow each location a unique design with a common look and feel within each concept. Each location has been designed to provide a high level of curb appeal as well as a comfortable dining experience. While our restaurants are individually designed to 
 9


create an unchained feel, all locations benefit from a focus on a contemporary and comfortable aesthetic that we believe compliments our food and creates a consistent dining experience across all of our concepts. This flexibility in design has allowed us to utilize a variety of locations and spaces, making the best use of the real estate available. 
 Many of our J. Alexander’s / Grill building designs utilize craftsman-style architecture, featuring natural materials such as stone, wood and weathered copper. Others reflect a blend of international and craftsman architecture featuring elements such as steel, concrete, stone and glass, subtly incorporated to give a contemporary feel. Several of our restaurants also feature a patio complemented by an exposed fire pit. J. Alexander’s / Grill locations typically contain approximately 6,900 to 9,000 square feet with seating for an average of approximately 220 guests. For J. Alexander’s / Grill locations, we estimate that a new build, excluding land, will typically require a total cash investment of $5,000 to $6,000 (excluding pre-opening costs and any tenant incentives). 
 Stoney River locations typically contain approximately 6,400 to 8,000 square feet with seating for an average of approximately 260 guests. Most of our Stoney River locations include private dining spaces that have historically contributed approximately 6.0% of sales to the Stoney River concept prior to fiscal 2020 when private dining sales were significantly limited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, the majority of our Stoney River locations operated as a dinner service only restaurant traditionally found within the steakhouse category of restaurants.  Over the past several years, we have added lunch and/or brunch service to selected locations.  Of the 13 Stoney River restaurants, seven and 10 locations are now serving lunch and brunch, respectively. Beginning with the new Stoney River restaurant in Troy, Michigan, which opened in October 2018, we anticipate that each new Stoney River location will operate as a lunch and dinner service restaurant. For Stoney River locations, we estimate that each new build, under the assumption noted above, will typically require a total cash investment of $5,000 to $6,000 (excluding pre-opening costs and any tenant incentives). 
 The flexibility of our concepts has enabled us to open restaurants in a wide variety of locations, including high-density residential areas, shopping malls, lifestyle centers and other high-traffic locations. On average, it takes us approximately 12 to 18 months from identification of the specific site to opening the doors for business. In order to maintain consistency of food and guest service as well as the unique atmosphere at our restaurants, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings. 
 Hiring and Training 
 We are highly focused on providing an unparalleled experience to our guests. Achieving this experience is intricately tied to careful hiring, thorough training and an apprenticeship for management trainees that provides intimate knowledge of every facet of our restaurants. We have implemented a sophisticated and stringent hiring and training program. Maintaining the uniqueness of our culture, with our focus on quality and training, starts with hiring. Excluding the needs of new restaurants and operating under normal conditions, we hire approximately 60 to 75 new management trainees annually. Including new locations, we believe this number is approximately 70 to 85 per year. We focus our recruiting efforts on approximately fifteen of the best culinary programs in the country where we believe our long-standing relationships with the schools enable us to identify and recruit the most promising students. These graduates typically spend three to five years in restaurant management before they are promoted to a department responsibility or a general manager role. During that time, they experience every job in the restaurant. Because of our focus on quality and training, we have traditionally found that some of our most successful managers have been hired from within. All restaurant management candidates, regardless of previous experience, are required to complete a 10-to-13-week training program at the beginning of their employment.
Suppliers
 To ensure that we maintain consistent pricing and quality throughout our restaurants, we use centralized contracts or pricing agreements with a network of third-party vendors, suppliers and distributors to provide selected items. We provide each vendor with a set of specifications to ensure that our food quality is maintained at the highest level. Where possible, we also take advantage of local farms or purveyors to provide in-season products to supplement our regular menu with recipes featuring high quality local or “farm-to-table” products. If commodity pricing increases significantly, we can work with our menu development team to create new and unique menu additions that can make the most efficient use of the products we have purchased or to improve the food margin of products on the menu.
 Beef is the largest percentage of our food costs, historically representing approximately 30% of total food and beverage costs. We purchase the majority of our beef directly from the producers, rather than through a distributor or third-party supplier. We believe that direct relationships with these vendors provide us cost and flexibility advantages that may not be available from third-party distributors. We have purchased beef from our current primary beef supplier for multiple consecutive years and anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. We do not hedge our beef purchases, and instead rely on our direct purchases and menu innovation to offset potential price increases. 
 10


While most of our current supply contracts are for no longer than one year, we have been purchasing from many of our suppliers for a number of years and believe that our relationships are strong, and their financial position secure. However, we believe that we do not rely on any single-source supplier that could not be replaced with one or more alternative suppliers without disruption. Should there be any disruption in our supply chain, we believe we have created a set of product specifications that can be met by a number of common restaurant suppliers. 
 Seasonality 
 Our net sales and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due in part to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season. In addition, certain of our restaurants, particularly those located in south Florida, typically experience an increase in guest traffic during the period between Thanksgiving and Easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year. Certain of our restaurants are located in areas subject to hurricanes and tropical storms, which typically occur during our third and fourth quarters, and which can negatively affect our net sales and operating results. Certain of our restaurants are located in areas subject to extreme winter weather conditions which typically occur during our fourth and first quarters and can also negatively affect our net sales and operating results. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
Intellectual Property and Trademarks 
 We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). We have registered the following marks with the PTO, among others: “J. Alexander’s Restaurant,” “Redlands Grill,” “Merus Grill,” “Black River Angus Beef,” “Black River Premium Beef,” “Legendary Steaks,” “Stoney River,” “Stoney River Legendary Steaks,” “Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill,” “Stoney River Legendary Filet,” “Seahorse” and “Birmingham Grill.” In addition, we have also registered the Internet domain names jalexanders.com, jalexandersholdings.com, redlandsgrill.com, overlandparkgrill.com, merusgrill.com and stoneyriver.com, among others, and have registered certain copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office, including copyrights with respect to the J. Alexander’s menu and the J. Alexander’s cocktail menu. 
 We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our concepts, and it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to such intellectual property. However, we cannot predict whether steps taken to protect such rights will be adequate. See “Risk Factors— Failure to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights could enable others to use names confusingly similar to the names and marks used by our restaurants, which could adversely affect the value of our concepts.” 
Marketing and Advertising
 We rely on our reputation, our loyal guest base and positive “word of mouth” advertising to maintain and grow our net sales and guest counts rather than focusing on traditional paid advertising through television, radio or print, or using significant discounting and couponing. We also rely on a social media and digital and email marketing strategy that provides us the opportunity to regularly engage with our guests and to reach a targeted new guest base in a cost-efficient manner. This strategy includes communications through Facebook®, Twitter®, Instagram®, YouTube®, and other social media platforms as well as direct email marketing to customers. See “Risk Factors – Any inability to actively and effectively utilize and manage social media could harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
 Locally-driven advertising is also evolving as another important aspect of our marketing strategy. We participate in local media events for critics and writers, including Yelp® events for their elite writers, as well as certain trade area promotional events, guest appearances on local television news restaurant segments, local lifestyle magazine ad buys, and local charitable events. We also make efforts to engage and build awareness with local event planners, hotel concierges and shuttle drivers, shopping center operators, chambers of commerce, neighborhood groups and others in the local communities in which we operate. For restaurants opening in new markets, we also issue press releases through local media channels to increase awareness ahead of the openings.
 Regulatory, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Environmental 
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution and protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances (“environmental laws”). These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance 
 11


and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third-parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors— Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
 Regulatory, Health and Safety 
 We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, public and occupational health and safety, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations, and we maintain all applicable permits and licenses required by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
 In addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we must comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally prohibit discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. The ADA became effective as to public accommodations and employment in 1992. 
 A significant amount of our net sales is attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Of the 16 states where we operate, most have dram-shop statutes or recognize a cause of action for damages relating to sales of alcoholic beverages to obviously intoxicated persons and/or minors. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. 
 In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions.  A significant number of our hourly restaurant staff members receive income from gratuities.  We participate voluntarily in a Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (“TRAC”) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. By complying with the educational and other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. Additionally, a significant number of our hourly employees who receive tips are paid at tipped minimum wage, which is significantly lower in most jurisdictions than full minimum wage rates.  Any increase in minimum wage rates will increase our labor costs. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we have been party to such matters in the past. See “Risk Factors—Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
 The PPACA, enacted in March 2010, requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations in the United States operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to guests, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Many of these requirements are inconsistent or are interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another. While our ability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, the effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time. See “Risk Factors— Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
 There is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the United States, where compliance with Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) management systems may now be required. HACCP refers to a management 
 12


system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP programs, and the United States government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011, granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. We anticipate that certain requirements may impact our industry. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to take actions that could be costly for us or otherwise harm our business. See “Risk Factors—Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Information Technology 
 All of our restaurants use computerized point-of-sale systems created by Micros Systems, which we believe are scalable to support our future growth plans. Our restaurants process credit cards using point-to-point encryption (“P2PE”) technology to ensure the highest level of credit card security protection for our guests.  The Company also uses EMV chip-card technology to provide an additional layer of credit card security.  We utilize a Windows-based accounting software package and a network that enables electronic communication throughout the Company. In addition, all of our restaurants utilize touch screen point-of-sale and electronic gift card systems, and also employ a theoretical food costing program, all of which were specifically designed for the restaurant industry. We use our management information systems to develop pricing strategies, identify food cost issues, monitor new product acceptance and evaluate restaurant-level productivity. The system also supplies sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. We use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly detailed profit and loss statements for each location with final reports following the end of each period. During 2020, the Company took measures to increase its off-premise sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, including investing in its online ordering platform with ChowNow®. The Company is also in the process of implementing a contactless payment solution and we anticipate that this initiative will be fully implemented in 2021. In 2019, we committed significant resources to the implementation of both a new restaurant back-office system that handles inventory and invoice management, theoretical food costing, product usage forecasting and other core restaurant-level processes, as well as a new human capital management solution that encompasses payroll processing, human resources and benefits management, recruiting and onboarding and other key talent management functions. We believe the investment in these technologies will allow management to have greater visibility into day-to-day operations, reduce compliance costs and risks, improve efficiency, reduce turnover and overtime labor and better leverage existing talent in managing the business on a long-term basis. We expect to continue to develop our management information systems to assist management in analyzing business issues and to improve efficiency. Federal and state regulation of privacy and security, particularly within the restaurant industry, may increase in scope or severity in the future. A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that our practices do not meet such laws or regulations could result in legal liability, adverse publicity, and require us to modify our practices and incur substantial costs and expenses. See “Risk Factors— Information technology system failures, including when transitioning to new systems, or breaches of our network security, including with respect to confidential information, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.”
Industry & Competition
 The restaurant industry has historically been fragmented and intensely competitive. We believe guests make their dining decisions based on a variety of factors such as menu offering, taste, quality and price of food offered, perceived value, service, atmosphere, location, overall dining experience and the ability to make a reservation. Although the industry has been severely and uniquely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that intense competition is likely to return to the industry over time.
 13


Depending on the specific concept, our restaurants compete with a number of restaurants within their markets, including both locally-owned, boutique, chef-driven restaurants and restaurants that are part of regional or national upscale dining concepts. We believe we have two primary types of competitors: 
  
• | Competitors with similar menus and operational characteristics; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitors that market to the same demographic using different menus and formats.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The number, size and strength of our competitors varies widely by region; however, we believe that we benefit from our goal of providing our guests with a combination of check average, food quality and intense levels of service that we believe to be unique in the markets in which we compete.
 In virtually all of our markets, we compete primarily against locally-owned boutique restaurants or locally-managed restaurant groups with similar menus and similar concept attributes at check averages that approximate ours. To a lesser extent, we compete with restaurant groups, both regional and national, that market to the same upscale restaurant guest and may have menus, formats and check averages that differ from ours. Del Frisco’s Grill, North Italia, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood and Seasons 52 are concepts that would fall within this second category, and would be considered competitors of our J. Alexander’s / Grill concepts. Stoney River generally competes with restaurants that are considered steakhouses or have a steakhouse format such as The Palm, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, STK, Morton’s The Steakhouse, Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House, and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of January 3, 2021, we employed approximately 3,200 persons, including 44 persons on the corporate staff. Of the employees in our restaurant locations, approximately 240 were employed in restaurant-level exempt management positions and the remainder were non-exempt hourly personnel. We were required to temporarily close our dining rooms in all locations for varying periods of time during 2020 in response to governmental mandates enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result we temporarily furloughed a portion of our hourly restaurant employees. As our dining rooms reopened we were able to bring back the majority of the furloughed hourly team members. During 2020, we implemented an Emergency Sick Leave Policy (“ESLP”) for our team members to provide two weeks of paid leave for those needing time off from work due to a COVID-19 illness or to cover a portion of the time that their restaurants were required to be closed for dining. In 2020, we incurred approximately $3,320 related to the ESLP and other sick or vacation leave and continuing benefits paid in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, despite the negative impact that COVID-19 has had on our business, we have not reduced salaries or hourly rates for our employees who either remained on staff or who have returned from temporary furlough.
 The health and safety of our guests and our employees continues to remain a top priority, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have focused on increasing safety measures during 2020 including the observance of social distancing protocols, employing the use of personal protective equipment, checking temperatures of employees daily, routinely sanitizing high-touch surface areas, and installing plexiglass and glass booth and pub dividers in our restaurants. We have also added work from home flexibility for our corporate office employees where appropriate. We continue to seek to align our policies and practices with guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control, and other relevant local, state and federal agencies.
 We currently are not party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good. Our human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, reward and retain a diverse base of the most talented employees in the industry. We believe that we offer competitive pay and benefits packages, including health and welfare and retirement benefits for eligible employees. Our restaurant management and the majority of our corporate staff are eligible to participate in annual cash-based performance bonus plans. Each of our incentive plans rewards individuals for achievement of restaurant-level and Company-wide business goals. For 2020, we paid restaurant management discretionary bonuses in recognition of their outstanding service during the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance our employees’ workplace experience as well as increase access to and awareness of benefits programs available to them. We also continuously evaluate our training programs for both our hourly team members and restaurant management and make adjustments as needed to ensure that our guests are provided with the highest quality food and service experience possible. Our new restaurant managers must successfully complete a 13-week comprehensive training program upon hire that covers all operational aspects of our business.
 We evaluate restaurant management turnover rates routinely. Our tenure at the restaurant General Manager level averages approximately 13 years, and the remainder of restaurant management averages approximately 5 years currently. Our corporate senior management team has an average tenure of over 20 years with the Company. Hiring, developing, and retaining employees is of critical 
 14


importance to the successful operations of our business, and we believe that our tenure and low turnover statistics are indicative of the quality of our programs and strength of our culture.
