Increase Market Share: We leverage our existing customer relationships to provide access points, sensors and other Industrial IoT RF products. We have made significant investments in developing new products that we can market and sell to our existing customer base using our same go-to-market strategy.  Many of our customers who purchase antennas for Industrial IoT applications also need other products we offer, such as sensors, interface cards and access points.  
 
Drive Operational and Financial Efficiency: We have a disciplined management team, and we will continuously improve processes and productivity including a focus on design for manufacturability.  
 
Markets and Market Opportunity
 
There are two key market drivers for our long-term growth: Industrial IoT and 5G. We believe that Industrial IoT has the greatest long-term potential for our antennas and ruggedized radio devices to support smart utilities and automation for manufacturing and commercial applications.  Industrial IoT will likely continue to be a growing market to address remote control and data analysis.  The critical link for many of these systems is the wireless connection between the device and the core system, which is where PCTEL seeks to adds value with our antennas, radio devices and sensors.  Enabling reliable and robust wireless connections is critical for wireless Industrial IoT.
 
5G is still in the early phases of deployment to address capacity in dense user areas.  It has better reliability, security, and lower latency than Wi-Fi. Future releases and the availability of new shared spectrum will likely drive further investment in 5G to support private networks and neutral host services in valuable mid-range spectrum.  Private networks provide a lower cost solution than cellular operators to support low latency applications for enterprises and remote operations for rural areas.  
 
Customers 
 
Our strategy is to leverage leading global OEMs and distributors to expand the reach of our products across multiple market segments and industries.  
 
Our antennas and Industrial IoT devices are sold to OEMs where they are designed into their customers’ solutions.  We also sell through distribution channels that promote and sell our products into specialized markets. We support our major stocking distributors, and we sell our antennas directly to customers where integration into larger systems is not required.
 
Our test & measurement equipment for the cellular market is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. Our test & measurement equipment for public safety markets is sold to distributors and other engineering service providers.   
 
We do not view customer concentration as a significant issue.  
 
Research and Development- Intellectual Property
 
Given that our mission is to solve complex RF problems for our customers, research and development is essential to our long-term success. We work closely with our customers, consultants, and market research organizations to monitor and predict changes in the wireless industry, including emerging industry standards. We continue to make substantial investments in engineering, talent, and research and development and we devote substantial resources to product development, innovation, and patent submissions.  
 
We have approximately 105 patents and over 60 patents pending in the U.S. and other countries worldwide.  The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes rather than for potential license revenue generation.
 Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of new products.  Our Global Marketing group is responsible for promotion and lead generation through optimizing our website, managing trade shows, social media, webinars and general marcom material generation.  Our sales function is managed under the Chief Sales Officer who has primary responsibility for revenue generation and oversight of the worldwide sales force.

Manufacturing
 
We have historically done final assembly of most of our antennas in-house at our facilities in Tianjin, China, and Bloomingdale, Illinois.  To optimize the cost structure of our antennas and reduce our fixed costs in China, over the past two years we transitioned most of the manufacturing activities from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. This transition was completed during the first quarter 2022.  The antennas related to the Smarteq acquisition are manufactured at contract manufacturers in Europe and Asia. We do final assembly of all our test & measurement products in-house at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland.
 
By transitioning some of our manufacturing to multiple contract manufacturers with a variety of expertise, we avoid becoming dependent on any specific contract manufacturer.  If any contract manufacturer is unable to provide timely or satisfactory services for us, our other contract manufacturers will be available, provided, however, that transitioning production to a different contract manufacturer could cause delays, disruption and additional costs that could negatively impact timely delivery of our products and our earnings therefrom.  We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers, but we do have open purchase orders with several of our suppliers.  
 
Human Capital
 Our employees are among our most valuable assets and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our global team. 
 We recognize that attracting, developing, and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. We offer employees competitive compensation and benefits, and resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diversity and expertise in our global businesses to fill key positions. We seek to hire people who share our values. We value technology and innovation and the achievement of customer-driven success.
