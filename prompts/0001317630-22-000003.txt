ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
ITC Holdings provides safe and reliable electric transmission service to connect consumers to more sustainable and cost-effective energy resources. ITC Holdings continues to make investments in a modernized grid to maintain reliability and accommodate future demands as our economy and lifestyles become increasingly dependent on electricity.
Our business consists primarily of the electric transmission operations of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Through our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, we own and operate high-voltage electric transmission systems in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula and portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma that transmit electricity from generating stations to local distribution facilities connected to our transmission systems.
Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ primary operating responsibilities include maintaining, improving and expanding their transmission systems to meet their customers’ ongoing needs, scheduling outages on system elements to allow for maintenance and construction, maintaining appropriate system voltages and monitoring flows over transmission lines and other facilities to ensure physical limits are not exceeded.
Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries earn revenues for the use of their electric transmission systems by their customers, which include investor-owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, power marketers and alternative energy suppliers. As independent transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to rate regulation only by the FERC, and our cost-based rates are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism” as well as in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
ITC Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ITC Investment Holdings. Fortis owns a majority indirect equity interest in ITC Investment Holdings, with GIC holding an indirect, passive, non-voting equity interest of 19.9%.
Development of Business
As we move toward a cleaner, sustainable and electrified economy, the power grid will need to be transformed and modernized. Technology deployment and innovation are occurring at an accelerated rate within our industry, so we are actively identifying and investing in infrastructure required to meet evolving system needs and energy policy objectives. Our long-term growth plan includes ongoing investments in our current regulated transmission systems and the identification of incremental strategic projects primarily located in and around our service territories. 
We expect to invest approximately $4.0 billion from 2022 through 2026 at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Included in this amount are capital expenditures to: (1) maintain and replace our current transmission infrastructure to enhance system reliability and accommodate load growth; (2) interconnect new renewable generation resources; (3) upgrade physical and technological grid security to protect critical infrastructure; and (4) expand access to electricity markets to reduce the overall cost of delivered energy to customers.
Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Investment and Operating Results Trends” for additional details about our long-term capital investments. Refer to the discussion of risks associated with our strategic investment opportunities in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Operations
As transmission-only companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries function as conduits, allowing for power from generators to be transmitted to local distribution systems either entirely through our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ own systems or in conjunction with neighboring transmission systems. Third parties then transmit power through these local distribution systems to end-use consumers. The transmission of electricity by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a central function to the provision of electricity to 
residential, commercial and industrial end-use consumers. The operations performed by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries fall into the following categories:
•asset planning;
•engineering;
•asset protection and performance;
•cyber security operations center; and
•real time operations.
Asset Planning
The Asset Planning group performs the role of detailing the required transmission infrastructure needed to support system changes and economic opportunities. System changes can arise from different points of origin including load growth, load shifts, or new points of interconnection; generation retirements or additions; operational needs; and system dynamic stability needs. Likewise, the Asset Planning group explores opportunities to better utilize the transmission system through economic planning by providing access, via transmission expansion projects, to lower cost energy. However, the core responsibility of the Asset Planning group is proactively anticipating the future demands placed upon the transmission system and developing corrective action plans for any deficiencies. Corrective action plans are developed to ensure compliance with NERC’s reliability standards. Additionally, the Asset Planning group seeks opportunities to further develop a resilient transmission system.
Transmission infrastructure plans are submitted as discrete projects into the MISO and SPP planning processes. As the regional planning authorities, MISO and SPP administer open and transparent processes through which the submitted projects are vetted. MISO and SPP produce transmission expansion plans, which include projects to be constructed by their members, including our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains.
Engineering
The Engineering group is composed of the Design, Capital Projects and Asset Management teams. The Engineering group works with outside contractors to perform various aspects of our design, construction and maintenance, but retains internal technical experts who have experience with respect to the key elements of the transmission system such as substations, lines, equipment and protective relaying systems.
Design — The Design team is responsible for the design of our transmission systems and setting the standards for equipment used on our systems.
Capital Projects — The Capital Projects team is responsible for project and construction management for capital projects, which includes the construction of new transmission infrastructure as well as asset renewal projects.
Asset Management — The Asset Management team performs the following activities:
•manages our vegetation management program;
•provides engineering technical support to the field;
•specifies, maintains and troubleshoots the protection and controls system that is used to protect and monitor our transmission infrastructure; and
•develops and tracks preventative maintenance to promote safe and reliable systems adhering to mandatory requirements of the NERC and the FERC.
By performing preventive maintenance on our assets, we can minimize the need for reactive maintenance, resulting in improved reliability and cost savings for our customers. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries contract with ULCS, which is a division of Asplundh Tree Expert Co., to perform the majority of their maintenance. The agreement with ULCS provides us with access to an experienced and scalable workforce with knowledge of our system at an established rate.
Asset Protection and Performance
The Asset Protection and Performance group is responsible for safety, human performance, security, and emergency preparedness and response. Given the inherent hazardous nature of the utilities industry, we proactively work to ensure that all personnel are free to perform in a safe and secure environment. Our focus is to not compromise the safety of our employees, contractors or the public in the course of providing the most reliable electricity transmission services. We maintain a safety program that includes proactive measures rooted in human performance tools to achieve that focus. Our emergency response plans ensure that we are prepared for a crisis and can maintain continuity of our business and service during said crisis. We operate a security command center from our headquarters facility in Michigan that monitors our most critical assets on a continuous basis. The security command center also gathers intelligence and works with our government and industry partners to prevent threats to our assets.
Cyber Security Operations Center
The Cyber Security Operations Center protects ITC’s reputation and brand by securing critical infrastructure, data, and computing systems from threat actors. We protect vital infrastructure by developing, refining, and continually delivering a comprehensive cyber security program while helping our stakeholders meet their business objectives. As the threat landscape becomes increasingly sophisticated and expansive, we continue to evolve our defensive strategy. We improve this strategy by deploying new technology, continuing education of our user community, and advancing our protections against ongoing cyber threats. We leverage threat intelligence and external industry practices for continuous improvement and refinement of our cyber security program.
Real Time Operations
System Operations — From our operations facilities in Michigan, transmission system operators continuously monitor the performance of the transmission systems of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, using software and communication systems to perform analysis to plan for contingencies and maintain security and reliability following any unplanned events on the system. Transmission system operators are also responsible for the switching and protective tagging function, taking equipment in and out of service to ensure capital construction projects and maintenance programs can be completed safely and reliably.
Local Balancing Authority Operator — Under the functional control of MISO, ITCTransmission and METC operate their electric transmission systems as a combined LBA area, known as MECS. From our operations facilities in Michigan, our employees perform the LBA functions as outlined in MISO’s Balancing Authority Agreement. These functions include actual interchange data administration and verification as well as MECS LBA area emergency procedure implementation and coordination. Besides ITCTransmission and METC, our other Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are not responsible for LBA functions for their respective assets.

ITC Interconnection acquired certain transmission assets from a merchant generating company and placed a 345kV transmission line in service. As a result, ITC Interconnection is a TO in PJM and is subject to rate regulation by the FERC. The revenues earned by ITC Interconnection are based on its facilities reimbursement agreement with the merchant generating company.
Regulatory Environment
Many regulators and public policy makers support the need for further investment in the transmission grid. The growth and changing mix of electricity generation, wholesale power sales and consumption combined with historically inadequate transmission investment have resulted in significant transmission constraints across the United States and increased stress on aging equipment. These problems will continue without increased investment in transmission infrastructure. Transmission system investments can also increase system reliability and reduce the frequency of power outages. Such investments can reduce transmission constraints and improve access to lower cost generation resources, resulting in a lower overall cost of delivered electricity for end-use consumers. The DOE has established the Office of Electricity that focuses on working with reliability experts from the power industry, state governments and their Canadian counterparts to improve grid reliability and increase investment in the country’s electric infrastructure.
The FERC requires TOs to comply with certain reliability standards and may take enforcement actions for violations, including the imposition of substantial fines. NERC is responsible for developing and enforcing these mandatory reliability standards. We continually assess our transmission systems against standards established by NERC, as well as the standards of applicable regional entities under NERC that have been delegated certain authority for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards. 
Finally, utility holding companies are subject to FERC regulations related to access to books and records in addition to the requirement of the FERC to review and approve mergers and consolidations involving utility assets and holding companies in certain circumstances.
Federal Regulation
As electric transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries charge rates that are regulated by the FERC. The FERC is an independent regulatory commission within the DOE that regulates the interstate transmission and certain wholesale sales of natural gas, the transmission of oil and oil products by pipeline and the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce. The FERC also administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and standards of conduct for the companies it regulates. 
Revenue Requirement Calculations and Cost Sharing for Projects with Regional Benefits
The cost-based Formula Rates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries include revenue requirement calculations for various types of projects. Network revenues continue to be the largest component of revenues recovered through our Formula Rates. However, regional cost sharing revenues have experienced long-term growth as a result of projects that have been identified as having regional benefits and are therefore eligible for regional cost recovery. Separate calculations of revenue requirement are performed for projects that have been approved for regional cost sharing.
We have projects that are eligible for regional cost sharing under the MISO tariff, such as certain network upgrade projects, and the MVPs. Additionally, certain projects at ITC Great Plains are eligible for recovery through a region-wide charge in the SPP tariff.
State Regulation
The regulatory agencies in the states where our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ assets are located do not have jurisdiction over our rates or terms and conditions of service. However, they typically have jurisdiction over siting of transmission facilities and related matters as described below. Additionally, we are subject to the 
regulatory oversight of various state environmental quality departments for compliance with any state environmental standards and regulations.

Sources of Revenue
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Significant Components of Results of Operations — Revenues” for a discussion of our principal sources of revenue.
Seasonality
The cost-based Formula Rates in effect for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, as discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism,” mitigate the seasonality of net income for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries accrue or defer revenues to the extent that the actual revenue requirement for the reporting period is higher or lower, respectively, than the amounts billed relating to that reporting period. For example, to the extent that amounts billed are less than our revenue requirement for a reporting period, a revenue accrual is recorded for the difference and the difference results in no net income impact.
Operating cash flows are seasonal at our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, in that cash received for revenues is typically higher in the summer months when peak load is higher.
Principal Customers
Our principal transmission service customers are DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L, which accounted for approximately 21.5%, 23.5% and 24.7%, respectively, of our consolidated billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. One or more of these customers together have consistently represented a significant percentage of our operating revenue. This portion of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the collection of 2019 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2021 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2021 operating revenues but will not be billed to our customers until 2023. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism” for a discussion on the difference between billed revenues and operating revenues. Our remaining revenues were generated from providing service to other entities such as alternative energy suppliers, power marketers and other wholesale customers that provide electricity to end-use consumers and from transaction-based capacity reservations. Nearly all of our revenues are from transmission customers in the United States. Although we may recognize allocated revenues from time to time from Canadian entities reserving transmission over the Ontario or Manitoba interface, these revenues have not been and are not expected to be material to us.
Billing
MISO and SPP are responsible for billing and collecting the majority of our transmission service revenues as well as independently administering the transmission tariff in their respective service territory. As the billing agents for our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains, MISO and SPP independently bill DTE Electric, Consumers Energy, IP&L and other customers on a monthly basis and collect fees for the use of our transmission systems. 
See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Credit Risk” for discussion of our credit policies.
Competition
Each of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries operates the primary transmission system in its respective service area and has limited competition for certain projects. Other entities with transmission development initiatives may compete with us by seeking approval to be named the party authorized to build new capital projects that we are also pursuing. Our subsidiaries may also compete with other entities on development opportunities for transmission investment in locations outside of our existing service areas. 
Human Capital Resources
ITC Holdings places significant emphasis on attracting, developing and retaining individuals who exemplify the values that are the cornerstone of our company. As of December 31, 2021, we had 705 employees, with low employee turnover and no significant change in the number of employees from the prior year. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we work with many outside firms to provide additional resources to support our business. We utilize human capital resources employed by these firms to assist with construction, maintenance, field operations and other corporate functions of our business. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers of contracted services.
Safety is of the utmost importance for our employees, and we consider safety to be a key priority for our company. Our safety policies, procedures and training practices have resulted in safety performance metrics that consistently rank us in the top decile among comparable electric utilities.
We believe that our compensation and benefit programs have been appropriately designed to attract and retain talent. Compensation for employees is made up of a combination of base salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentive pay structures. In addition, we offer a comprehensive package of additional benefits for all of our employees and various professional development opportunities through internal and external programs.
We strive to provide an inclusive and diverse environment for all of our employees. We believe that by recognizing and valuing our employees’ similarities, as well as their differences, we make our shared goals possible. In addition to our internal commitments to inclusion and diversity, we are continuing to enhance our supplier diversity program. This effort will further diversify our supplier base through the recruitment and growth of businesses owned by minorities, women and veterans.
