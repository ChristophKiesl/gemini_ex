Overview
 
Aegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen pipelines and other infrastructure around the world. For 50 years, we have played a pioneering role in finding transformational solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening and increased longevity of buildings, bridges and other structures. We are committed to keeping infrastructure working better, safer and longer for customers and communities around the world. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world’s infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.
 
Our Company premise is to use technology to extend the structural design life and maintain, if not improve, the performance of infrastructure, mostly pipelines and piping systems. We have proved this expertise can be applied in a variety of markets to protect pipelines in oil, gas, nuclear, power, utility, mining, industrial, wastewater and water applications and can be extended to the rehabilitation and maintenance of commercial structures and the provision of professional services in refineries. Many types of infrastructure must be protected from the corrosive and abrasive materials that pass through or near them. Our expertise in non-disruptive corrosion engineering and abrasion protection is wide-ranging. We have a long history of product development and intellectual property management. We manufacture many of the engineered solutions we offer to customers as well as the specialized equipment required to install them. In addition, decades of experience give us an advantage in understanding municipal, utility, energy, mining, industrial and commercial customers. Strong customer relationships and brand recognition allow us to support the expansion of existing and innovative technologies in our core end markets.
 
We originally incorporated in Delaware in 1980 to act as the exclusive United States licensee of the Insituform® cured-in-place pipe (“CIPP”) process, which Insituform’s founder invented in 1971. The Insituform® CIPP process served as the first trenchless technology for rehabilitating wastewater pipelines and has enabled municipalities and private industry to avoid the extraordinary expense, environmental impact and extreme disruption that can result from conventional dig-and-replace methods. We have maintained our leadership position in the CIPP market from manufacturing to technological innovations and market share for 50 years.
 
We embarked on a diversification strategy in 2009 to expand not only our geographic reach but also our product and service portfolio into the oil and gas markets. Through a series of strategic initiatives and acquisitions, we built up a broad portfolio of cost-effective solutions for rehabilitating and maintaining aging or deteriorating infrastructure, protecting new infrastructure from corrosion and other threats, and providing integrated professional services in engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and turnaround services for oil and natural gas companies, primarily in the midstream and downstream markets. Over the last six years, we have taken a number of actions to position our operations in markets with favorable scale and earnings profiles and reduce our footprint in markets where growth opportunities were limited, uneven, or better served by a different business model. Further, as announced in December 2020, our Board of Directors approved the divestiture of our Energy Services segment, which reflects an advancement of our strategy to preserve and grow, through innovation and new product offerings, our industry leadership in our core business of the rehabilitation of pipelines with a focus on the water and wastewater markets. The operating results of the former Energy Services segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, the relevant asset and liability balances of Energy Services are presented as held for sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
Pending Merger
 
On February 16, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Carter Intermediate, Inc. (“Parent”) and Carter Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of investment funds affiliated with New Mountain Capital, L.L.C., a leading growth-oriented investment firm headquartered in New York (together with Parent and Merger Sub, “New Mountain”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). If the Merger closes, our stockholders would receive $26.00 in cash for each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, they hold on the Merger closing date. If the Merger is completed, our common stock will be de-listed from the Nasdaq and de-registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and we will become a private company. The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “HSR Act”) and approval of our stockholders.

Our Segments
 
We have two operating segments that are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection. Our operating segments correspond to our management organizational structure. Each operating segment has leadership that reports to our chief executive officer, who is also the chief operating decision manager (“CODM”). The operating results and financial information reported by each segment are evaluated separately, regularly reviewed and used by the CODM to evaluate segment performance, allocate resources and determine management incentive compensation. In December 2020, our board of directors approved a plan to sell our Energy Services operating segment. As a result, the operating results of the former Energy Services segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Notes 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for further discussion.
 
Infrastructure Solutions – The majority of our work is performed in the municipal water and wastewater pipeline sector. While the pace of growth is primarily driven by government funding and spending, overall demand is strong due to required improvements to aging pipeline infrastructure in our core markets, which should result in a long-term stable growth opportunity for our market leading products, Insituform® CIPP, the Tyfo® system and Fusible PVC® pipe.
 
Corrosion Protection – Corrosion Protection is positioned to capture the benefits of oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure developments across North America and internationally, as producers and midstream pipeline companies transport their product from onshore and offshore oil and gas fields to regional demand centers. We provide solutions to customers to enhance the safety, environmental integrity, reliability and compliance of their pipelines in the global transmission and distribution network, especially in the oil and gas markets. The segment has a broad portfolio of technologies, products and services to protect, maintain, rehabilitate, assess and monitor pipelines from the effects of corrosion, including cathodic protection, interior pipe linings, interior and exterior pipe and weld coatings and inspection and repair capabilities, as well as an increasing offering of asset integrity management data storage and analytics capabilities related to these services.
Our Long-Term Strategy
 
Aegion primarily serves aging infrastructure markets, where the demand for maintenance and rehabilitation exceeds available funding and resources. That imbalance results in favorable long-term growth trends in our core markets. Our focus on rehabilitation also lessens our dependence on new construction activity, which reduces our risk in cyclical markets. We also see a growing global awareness of health, safety and environmental issues, which further reinforces the need for the environmentally sustainable solutions we provide. We are committed to being a valued partner to our customers, with a constant focus on expanding those relationships by solving complex infrastructure problems, enhancing our capabilities and improving execution while also developing or acquiring innovative technologies and comprehensive services. We are pursuing growth through three key strategic offerings:
Municipal Pipeline Rehabilitation – The fundamental driver in the global municipal pipeline rehabilitation market is the growing gap between the need and current spend. While we do not expect the spending gap to close any time soon, the increasing need for pipeline rehabilitation supports a long-term sustainable market for the technologies and services offered by our Infrastructure Solutions segment. A Bluefield research forecast estimates that in the U.S. alone, more than $230 billion of capital expenditures are forecasted over the next decade to address water and wastewater pipeline infrastructure, where the national average age of water and wastewater pipeline has climbed to 45 years. Rehabilitation of existing pipes is expected to be the fastest growing spend category, and with installation costs including labor and paving making up a significant percentage of overall capex, municipalities will continue to look for trenchless solutions in lieu of more expensive and socially disruptive dig-and-replace alternatives.
 
We are committed to maintaining our market leadership position in the trenchless rehabilitation of wastewater pipelines in North America using our CIPP technology, the largest contributor to Aegion’s consolidated revenues. We have a diverse portfolio of trenchless technologies to rehabilitate aging and damaged municipal pipelines. We are also focused on growing our presence in the rehabilitation of pressure pipelines (i.e., water pipelines). It is estimated that water loss at U.S. utilities averages 15% annually with some municipalities losing more than half of all water pumped and treated for distribution to customers. Our pressure pipe portfolio includes Fusible PVC®, InsituMain® CIPP, Tyfo® fiber-reinforced polymer (“FRP”) and Tite Liner® high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) systems. As part of our pressure pipe strategy, we have continued to invest in the development of a mechanical services reinstatement for pressure pipe lateral connections. We believe this new technology will allow Aegion to become a leading provider in the North American pressure pipe rehabilitation market and are focused on commercializing this offering more broadly to customers in 2021. While the majority of our CIPP liner installations use felt tube cured by steam or hot water, we have been focused in the last couple of years on expanding our capabilities to offer fiberglass reinforced tube and felt tube that uses an ultraviolet (UV) curing process, which gives us a broader offering to meet the ever changing needs of our customer base. We also are continuing to grow our third-party product sales, both domestically and internationally, which allows us to leverage our strong manufacturing footprint in the U.S. and Europe with a lower risk and higher margin operating model in certain geographies as a global technology provider. Our international strategy is to use a blend of third-party product sales as well as FRP contract installation operations in select markets.  
 
Pipeline Integrity and Corrosion Management – The oil and gas sector has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as decreased economic and travel activity has led to reduced global demand. However, recent Energy Information Industry data shows an increase in demand and limited increases in production as regions recover from COVID-19.  North America midstream operators will continue to evaluate new opportunities to expand existing networks, build greenfield pipelines and ensure existing infrastructure is operating as safely and efficiently as possible. Aegion is well positioned to serve our markets with a broad suite of offerings, providing pipeline protection through interior pipe linings, interior and exterior pipe weld coatings and insulation as well as best-in-class cathodic protection systems that inhibit exterior pipeline corrosion.
 
There are over one million miles of regulated pipelines in North America, which remain the safest and most cost-effective mode of oil and gas transmission. Within our Corrosion Protection segment, the design and installation of cathodic protection systems to help prevent pipeline corrosion have historically represented a large portion of the revenues and profits for the segment. We also provide inspection services to monitor these systems and detect early signs of corrosion. Our asset integrity digital data collection and analysis tool increases the efficiency and accuracy of pipeline corrosion assessment data we collect as well as upgrades how we share this valuable information with customers. This offering allows us to improve customer regulatory compliance by providing critical real-time monitoring and assessment of external corrosion threats to help guide decision making for pipeline operators as part of their asset integrity management programs.
 
The outlook in the Middle East for our products and services remains strong as well. Strong product acceptance for our industrial linings and coatings applications, along with our solid track record of operating safely in the region for more than a decade, positions us well to capture growth opportunities arising from this multi-year development pipeline.

Restructuring Activities
 
In 2017, our board of directors approved the Restructuring, a comprehensive global realignment and restructuring plan. As part of the Restructuring, we announced plans to: (i) divest our pipe coating and insulation businesses in Louisiana, The Bayou Companies, LLC and Bayou Wasco Insulation, LLC (collectively “Bayou”); (ii) exit all non-pipe related contract applications for the Tyfo® system in North America; (iii) right-size the cathodic protection services operation in Canada and the CIPP businesses in Australia and Denmark; and (iv) reduce corporate and other operating costs.
 
During 2018 and 2019, our board of directors approved additional actions with respect to the Restructuring, which included the decisions to: (i) divest the Australia and Denmark CIPP businesses; (ii) take actions to further optimize operations within North America, including measures to reduce consolidated operating costs; and (iii) divest or otherwise exit multiple additional international businesses, including: (a) our cathodic protection installation activities in the Middle East, including Corrpower International Limited, our cathodic protection materials manufacturing and production joint venture in Saudi Arabia; (b) United Pipeline de Mexico S.A. de C.V., our Tite Liner® joint venture in Mexico (“United Mexico”); (c) our Tite Liner® businesses in Brazil and Argentina; (d) Aegion South Africa Proprietary Limited, our Tite Liner® and CIPP joint venture in the Republic of South Africa; and (e) our CIPP contract installation operations in England, the Netherlands, Spain and Northern Ireland.
 
We completed the divestitures of Bayou and the Denmark CIPP business in 2018. We also completed the divestitures of the Netherlands CIPP business and Tite Liner® joint venture in Mexico in 2019, as well as the shutdown of activities for the CIPP business in England. We completed the divestitures of CIPP operations in Australia and Spain in early 2020. Remaining shutdown activities include our Corrosion Protection business in Argentina, which is expected to be completed in 2021. Additionally, the exit of our cathodic protection installation activities in the Middle East and our Tite Liner and CIPP joint venture in South Africa are substantially complete, though we expect minimal wind-down activities will extend through the first half of 2021 related to a small number of projects remaining in backlog and other wind-down activities. The sale of the Northern Ireland contracting operation was temporarily suspended, but management expects to recommence the sale process during the second half of 2021.
 
As part of efforts to optimize our cathodic protection operations in North America, management initiated plans during 2019 to further downsize operations in the U.S., including the closure of three branch offices and the exit of capital intensive drilling activities at four branch offices. These actions included a reduction of approximately 20% of the cathodic protection domestic workforce and an exit of drilling activities that contributed approximately 20% to our cathodic protection domestic revenues in 2019. We expect these actions to improve our cathodic protection cost structure in the U.S., eliminate unprofitable results in certain parts of the business and reduce consolidated annual expenses for the business overall. Also during 2019, we reduced corporate headcount and took other actions to reduce corporate costs.
 
Although not part of the original outlined restructuring plan, during 2020, management executed additional headcount reductions and office closings across the Company related to business slowdowns and to balance the effects of COVID-19. We also implemented further actions at our cathodic protection operations in North America to reduce our exposure to construction activities, including additional headcount reductions and office closures. Additionally, we dissolved our specialty turnaround services business, P2S ServTech, LLC (“P2S”), which is reported within discontinued operations.
 
See Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for a detailed discussion regarding strategic initiatives and restructuring efforts.

Technologies
 
Infrastructure Solutions
 
Our Insituform® CIPP process (including Insitupipe® and Insitutube®) for the rehabilitation of wastewater pipelines and other conduits utilizes a custom-manufactured tube, or liner, made of synthetic fiber. After the tube is saturated (impregnated) with a thermosetting resin mixture, it is installed in the host pipe by various processes. The resin is then cured, by heat (hot water or steam) or ultraviolet light, forming a new rigid pipe within a pipe.
 
Our iPlus® Infusion® pull-in CIPP is a trenchless method for the rehabilitation of small-diameter wastewater pipelines, whereby a felt liner is continuously impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin through a proprietary process, after which the liner is pulled into the host pipe, inflated with air and cured with steam or ultraviolet light.
 
Our iPlus® Composite CIPP is used for the trenchless rehabilitation of large-diameter wastewater pipelines, where the felt liner is reinforced with carbon or glass fiber, impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin, inverted into place and cured with hot water or steam.
 
Our InsituMain® CIPP system is a solution for pressure pipes, including water mains and force mains up to 96-inches in diameter. The system can negotiate bends and is pressure-rated up to 150 psi. The InsituMain® system has also been certified as complying with NSF/ANSI Standard 61.
 
Our Insituform® RPP™ process is a trenchless technology used for the rehabilitation of wastewater force mains and industrial pressure pipelines. The felt tube is reinforced with glass and impregnated with liquid, thermosetting resin, after which it is inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a structural, jointless pipe within the host pipe.
Our Insituform® PPL® process is a trenchless technology certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61 used for the rehabilitation of drinking water and industrial pressure pipelines. A glass-reinforced liner is impregnated with an epoxy or vinyl ester resin, inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a jointless pipe lining within the host pipe.
Our Thermopipe™ system is a non-disruptive pressure pipe rehabilitation system ideal for potable and non-potable water mains whereby a high tenacity polyester reinforced liner is winched into a host pipe from a reel and inflated with air, forming a close-fit, jointless, leak-free lining system able to independently carry the full system design pressure.  
 
    7 

  

Our iPlus® Glass UV system is a CIPP solution for small- to medium-diameter pipes utilizing a glass fiber tube that is impregnated with a resin sensitive to ultraviolet light. The tube is pulled into place in the host pipe, inflated by air and cured via an ultraviolet light source.
 
Our iPlus® Felt UV system is a CIPP solution for small- to medium-diameter pipes utilizing a 100% felt tube that is impregnated with a resin sensitive to ultraviolet light. The tube is pulled into place in the host pipe, inflated by air and cured via an ultraviolet light source.
 
Sliplining is a method used to push or pull a new pipeline into an old one. With segmented sliplining, short segments of pipe are joined to form the new pipe. For gravity wastewater rehabilitation, these short segments can often be joined in a manhole or access structure, eliminating the need for a large pulling pit.
 
Our iTap® is an internal service line reinstatement process that includes associated fittings, robotics and control systems for leak free connections in CIPP lined potable water mains.
 
Our Fusible PVC® technology contains proprietary polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) formulation that, when combined with its patented fusion process, results in a monolithic, fully-restrained, gasket-free, leak-free piping system. Fusible PVC® pipe products include Fusible C-900® and FPVC® pipes. Fusible C-900® pipes comply with the AWWA C900 standard and are certified to the NSF/ANSI Standard 61.
 
Our Tyfo® Fibrwrap® system is a series of high-strength, light-weight fiber reinforced polymers used to strengthen structures, including columns, walls, slabs, beams and large diameter pressure pipelines. Beyond general strengthening of pipelines and structures, the Tyfo® Fibrwrap® system also has applications in blast mitigation and seismic retrofits.
 
See “Patents and Proprietary Technologies” below for more information concerning certain of these technologies.
 
Corrosion Protection
 
Our Tite Liner® system is a method of lining new and existing pipe with a corrosion and abrasion resistant thermoplastic pipe.
 
Our Safetyliner® product is a grooved thermoplastic liner that is installed in an industrial pipeline using the Tite Liner® process. The Safetyliner® liner is normally used in natural gas or CO2 pipelines to allow the release of gas that permeates the thermoplastic liner. If gas is allowed to build in the annular space under normal operating conditions, the line can be susceptible to collapse upon sudden changes in operating pressures. The Safetyliner® liner also has been used in pipelines as a leak detection system and for dual containment in mine water pipelines.
 
Our rotational lining process or "rotolining" bonds a uniform, seamless polymer layer to the interior of virtually any metallic structure, regardless of shape and complexity. This result is achieved by placing granular resin inside the structure to be lined and all openings are covered. The structure is then heated while simultaneously being rotated about two axis. The resin melts and flows evening over the entire inner surface of the structure, bonding to the metal substrate. Once cooled, the result is a monolithic corrosion and chemical resistant lining that conforms to complex shapes and is virtually free of stresses.
 
Our WeldTite® family of products allows for the connection of individual lined pipe sections through the use of welding rather than the industry standard of bolted flange connections.  This provides an extra level of assurance against leaks and allows United Pipeline Systems to utilize its liner systems in customer locations such as environmentally sensitive areas or offshore where flanges are generally not allowed.
 
Our PreFIT® product line offers customers thermoplastic lined steel pipe in sections short enough to be manufactured, transported, and then inventoried at a customer’s location.  This allows customers more control of their pipeline production schedules when compared with standard on-site liner installation processes.
 
Our fusion bonded epoxy pipeline coating utilizes heat to melt a dry powder FBE coating material into liquid form. The liquid material flows onto the steel pipe and solidifies through a process called cross-linking. Once cooled, this “fusion-bonded” epoxy cannot return to its original state and forms a corrosion protection barrier on the interior or exterior surface of the pipe.
 
Our 3-layer polyethylene coating is an external coating for buried or submerged oil or gas pipelines and offers superior adhesion, cathodic disbondment resistance and mechanical protection.
 
Our deepwater coating and insulation capabilities answer the challenge of subsea wet insulation requirements for high-pressure and high-temperature environments. Applications include subsea equipment and field joints for coating the girth welds where the pipe coating has been cutback to allow for welding joints of pipe.
 
Our internal field joint coating technology consists of self-contained robots that travel inside the pipe, find the weld and then clean, vacuum and coat the area. Utilizing various cameras, these field joint coating robots transmit a real-time video image back to the operator which is then used for control and inspection. The technology allows for the field application of FBE and plural component liquid materials to the weld area.
 
Our liquid coating services offer a wide array of plural component and multi-layer corrosion coatings. These coatings can be applied to protect metallic substrates of nearly any geometry, including pipeline equipment and manifolds.
 
Cathodic protection is an electrochemical process that prevents corrosion of new structures and stops corrosion on existing structures. Metal loss is prevented by the passing of a very small direct current from a cathodic protection electrode (anode), through the electrolyte (soil, water, concrete, etc.) on to the structure to be protected (cathode).  In this process, the anode corrodes, sacrificing itself to protect the integrity of the cathode.  Structures commonly protected by this process include oil and gas pipelines, offshore platforms, above and underground storage tanks, ships, electric power plants, bridges, parking garages, transit systems and water and wastewater facilities.
 
Our CorrFlex® system is a linear anode system installed parallel to pipelines, oftentimes to prevent stress corrosion cracking that can lead to ruptures on high pressure gas transmission pipelines.
 
Our CorrSpray® product provides a unique solution for preventing corrosion of steel reinforcements in concrete structures.
 
Our Corrpower® DC power supplies include innovative designs, plus remote monitoring and control capabilities.
 
Our Green Rectifier® system is an ecologically friendly method of cathodic protection using solar panels and a wind generator to power the cathodic protection process.
 
Our Permanode® product is a submerged anode system that was introduced over four decades ago, and it is the industry standard for internal water tank cathodic protection designs.
 
    8 

  

Our Grid™ system has set the global standard for preventing releases from external corrosion of at-grade storage tanks containing oil and petroleum products, thereby ensuring safe operations and protection of the environment.
 
Our AC interference mitigation solution protects pipeline operators and the public from electrical hazards when pipelines share space on rights-of-way with overhead electric transmission lines. Beginning with advanced predictive modeling, we then design mitigation schemes and provide systems to protect people and the pipeline.
 
Our asset integrity management (AIM) platform allows for the collection, communication and storage of data in the cloud using a geospatial information system-based, centralized, integrated repository that provides us and our customers more timely information and improved data analytics. Data collection applications include LiveLine® and CISView™, data delivery applications include AssetView® and FieldLine®, and data analytical tools include ScanLine® and ChargeLine®.
 
Our Correlator™ data collection system electronically records corrosion protection data on our customer’s assets, then transmits and stores the data in our AIM platform for compliance reporting and advanced analytics.
 
See “Patents and Proprietary Technologies” below for more information concerning certain of these technologies.
 
Operations
 
We are organized into two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection. Both segments are regularly reviewed and evaluated separately.  Energy Services is no longer considered an operating segment following the approval by our Board of Directors in December 2020 to divest Energy Services.
 
Our operations are generally project oriented. Projects may range in duration from just a few days to several years and can be performed as one-time contracts or as part of longer-term agreements. These contracts are usually obtained through competitive bidding or negotiations and require performance at a fixed price or time and materials basis. Our Corrosion Protection projects are generally performed under contracts with industrial entities. A majority of our water and wastewater rehabilitation installation projects in our Infrastructure Solutions segment are performed under contracts with municipal entities. Independent contractors may be utilized to perform portions of the work on any given project that we provide.
 
Infrastructure Solutions Operations
 
Our water and wastewater pipeline rehabilitation activities are conducted principally through installation and other construction operations performed directly by our subsidiaries.
 
Our North American Infrastructure Solutions operations, including research and development, engineering, training and financial support systems, are headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Tube manufacturing and processing facilities for North America are maintained in ten locations, geographically dispersed throughout the United States and Canada to support our North American contracting operations and through which we sell liners to third parties, domestically and internationally. We have also developed internally multifunctional robotic devices which we utilize in connection with the inspection and repair of pipelines.
 
We also maintain a manufacturing facility in Wellingborough, United Kingdom and one wetout facility in continental Europe to support our third-party product sales of liners internationally.
 
We have granted licenses to our trenchless rehabilitation processes to unaffiliated companies in certain geographic regions. As described under “Ownership Interests in Operating Licensees and Joint Ventures” below, we have also entered into contractual joint ventures from time to time to capitalize on our trenchless rehabilitation processes. Under these contractual joint venture relationships, work is bid by the joint venture entity and subcontracted to the joint venture partners or to third parties. The joint venture partners are primarily responsible for their subcontracted work, but both joint venture partners are liable to the customer for all of the work. Revenues and associated costs are recorded using percentage-of-completion accounting for our subcontracted portion of the total contract only.
 
In addition to wastewater pipeline rehabilitation, we have performed water pipeline rehabilitation operations since 2006 using our pressure pipe product portfolio. We are now able to restore water pipes using our InsituMain® CIPP and the Tite Liner® and Tyfo® systems.
 
Our 2016 acquisition of Underground Solutions, headquartered in Poway, California, bolstered our capabilities with respect to water pipeline rehabilitation operations. We are now able to provide additional infrastructure technologies for water, wastewater and conduit applications, primarily Fusible PVC® pipe, which, when combined with its patented fusion process, results in a monolithic, fully-restrained, gasket-free, leak-free piping system.

We have previously entered into teaming and other cooperative arrangements in various geographic regions throughout the world in order to develop cooperative bids on contracts for our thermoplastic pipeline rehabilitation and cathodic protection businesses. Typically, the arrangements provide for each participant to complete its respective scope of work, and we are not required to complete the other participant’s scope of work. We continue to investigate opportunities for expanding our business through such arrangements.
 
We previously entered into contractual joint ventures in other geographic regions in order to develop joint bids on contracts for our wastewater pipeline rehabilitation business. Typically, the joint venture entity holds the contract with the owner and subcontracts portions of the work to the joint venture partners. As part of the subcontracts, the partners usually provide bonds to the joint venture. We could be required to complete our joint venture partner’s portion of the contract if the partner were unable to complete its portion and a bond is not available. We continue to investigate opportunities for expanding our business through such arrangements.
 
Product Development
 
We seek out and develop innovative solutions for pipelines and other infrastructure through a stage-gate process for management of our research and development initiatives, whereby a market and business impact evaluation is conducted at each gate review. Corporate and business unit resources make up the specific research and development teams, supplemented, where beneficial, by our technology partners (often major suppliers), outside consultants and academic institutions. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we spent $4.9 million, $6.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively, on research and development related activities, including engineering.  
Customers and Marketing
 
We offer our products and services to highly diverse markets worldwide. We service municipal, state and federal governments, as well as corporate customers in numerous industries including pipelines, energy, oil and gas, refinery, mining, general and industrial construction, infrastructure (buildings, bridges, tunnels, railways, etc.), water and wastewater, transportation, utilities, maritime and defense. Our products and services are currently utilized and performed in more than 80 countries across six continents.
 
    11 

  

We offer our corrosion protection solutions worldwide to energy, refinery, mining and other customers to protect new and existing pipelines and other structures. The marketing of wastewater pipeline rehabilitation technologies is focused primarily on the municipal wastewater markets worldwide. We offer our water rehabilitation products to municipal and commercial customers. We offer our other infrastructure rehabilitation products worldwide to certain certified third-party installers and applicators and market our engineering, manufacturing and, in some countries, installation services to municipal, state, federal and commercial customers. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
 
To help shape decision-making at every step, we use a highly-trained, multi-level sales force structured around target markets and key accounts, focusing on engineers, contractors, consultants, administrators, technical staff and public officials. Due to the technical nature of our products and services, many of our sales personnel have engineering or technical expertise and experience. We also produce sales literature and presentations, participate in trade shows, present at conferences and execute other marketing programs for our own sales force and those of unaffiliated licensees. Our unaffiliated licensees are responsible for marketing and sales activities in their respective territories. See “Licensees” and “Ownership Interests in Operating Licensees and Joint Ventures” above for a description of our licensing operations and for a description of investments in licensees.
 
Contract Backlog
 
Contract backlog is our expectation of revenues to be generated from received, signed and uncompleted contracts, the cancellation of which is not anticipated at the time of reporting. We assume that these signed contracts are funded. For government or municipal contracts, our customers generally obtain funding through local budgets or pre-approved bond financing. We generally do not undertake a process to verify funding status of these contracts and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate what portion, if any, of our contracts in backlog have not been funded. However, we have little history of signed contracts being canceled due to the lack of funding. Contract backlog excludes any term contract amounts for which there are not specific and determinable work releases and projects where we have been advised that we are the low bidder, but have not formally been awarded the contract.
 
In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer. Contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in scope and of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings.
 
Included within backlog for Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection are certain contracts that are performed through our variable interest entities in which we own a controlling portion of the entity. A substantial majority of our contracts in these two segments are fixed price contracts with individual private businesses and municipal and federal government entities across the world.
 
Our discontinued operations generally enter into cost reimbursable contracts that are based on costs incurred at agreed upon contractual rates. Included within backlog are amounts that represent expected revenues to be realized under long-term Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) and other signed contracts. If the remaining term of these arrangements exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such arrangements included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of expected revenues. Although backlog represents only those contracts and MSAs that are considered to be firm, there can be no assurance that cancellation or scope adjustments will not occur with respect to such contracts.
 
For additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 below.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We maintain our North American Insituform® CIPP process liner manufacturing facility in Batesville, Mississippi. In Europe, we manufacture and sell Insituform® CIPP process liners from our plant located in Wellingborough, United Kingdom. Although raw materials used in Insituform® CIPP process products are typically available from multiple sources, our historical practice has been to purchase materials from a limited number of suppliers. We maintain our own felt manufacturing facility in Batesville, Mississippi. Substantially all of our fiber requirements are purchased from four sources, but there are alternate vendors readily available. We source our global resin supply from multiple vendors. We also manufacture certain equipment used in our Insituform® CIPP business. We believe that the sources of supply for our Insituform® CIPP operations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific are adequate for our needs.
 
    12 

  

We sell Insituform® CIPP process liners, equipment and related products to third parties and certain licensees on a long-term or, in certain instances, on a project-by-project basis. In addition to sales made on a project-by-project basis world-wide, we have entered into supply agreements with five third parties in Europe as well as third parties in India, Australia and Japan to supply them with Insituform® CIPP process liners and related products.
 
With regard to Underground Solutions, we have a limited number of qualified third-party extruders to manufacture our Fusible PVC® pipe products.
 
The principal raw materials used by Fyfe in the manufacture of FRP composite materials are carbon, glass, resins, fabric and epoxy raw materials. Fabric and epoxies are the most significant materials purchased, which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers, although these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors. The weaving of FRP components into woven fabric is done at our facility in La Conner, Washington. Fyfe does specialized blending of unique epoxies from basic chemicals at our Batesville, Mississippi facility. The epoxy resin is also repackaged at our Batesville, Mississippi facility, and specialized blending is also often done on each job site. Fyfe also sells finished materials throughout the United States and worldwide to our affiliates and certain certified third-party applicators.
 
Product and material revenues for our Corrpro business are derived principally from the sale of products that are purchased from select outside vendors or from assembling components that are sourced from suppliers. We conduct light assembly for a number of our Corrpro® products in our production facilities in Sand Springs, Oklahoma; Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; and the United Kingdom. In addition, we manufacture our own line of rectifiers and other power supplies in Canada and the United Kingdom. The primary products and raw materials used by our Corrpro businesses include zinc, aluminum, magnesium and other metallic anodes, as well as wire and cable. We maintain relationships with multiple vendors for these products and are not dependent on any single vendor to meet our supply needs.
 
The product and service revenues for our United Pipeline Systems business are derived primarily from the procurement and installation of HDPE liners inside pipelines. The raw material used for these liners is extruded thermoplastic pipe. It has been our practice to purchase this material from a select group of suppliers; however, we believe that it is available from many other sources. We manufacture most of the proprietary equipment and many of the consumable items used in Tite Liner® system installations in our own facilities in Canada, the United States and Chile. 
 
Product and service revenues for our ACS business is derived principally from internal and external pipeline coating. Facilities are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Conroe, Texas and Saudi Arabia. The primary raw materials used in the coating process include FBE and paint. Although our historical practice has been to purchase materials from a limited number of suppliers, we believe that the raw materials used in the coating process are typically available from multiple sources. However, in certain limited circumstances, our customer has required use of a specific material available from only a single source.
 
Our pricing of raw materials is subject to fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices. See “Commodity Risk” in Item 7A of this Report for detail on our management of the risks associated with such price fluctuations.
 
Patents and Proprietary Technologies
 
We have obtained and are pursuing patent protection in our principal global markets covering various aspects of our proprietary technology. Activity as of December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:

 | United States | Foreign 
-------------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------
Process, System or Product | Number of Patents Held | Number of Patents Pending | Number of Patents Held | Number of Patents Pending
Insituform® CIPP | 36 | 13 | 77 | 17 (1) 
Fusible PVC® | 11 | – | 12 | – 
Tyfo® | 13 | – | 10 | – 
Tite Liner® | 2 | 2 | 8 | 2 
Cathodic Protection Operations | 3 | 3 | – | 3 
Coatings Operations | 6 | 1 | 8 | 1 
Total | 71 | 19 | 115 | 23 


(1) | Includes two Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that cover most jurisdictions throughout the world and three European Patent Convention applications that cover multiple jurisdictions in Europe.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    13 

  

The specifications and/or rights granted in relation to each patent will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, as a result of differences in the nature of the work performed and in the climate of the countries in which the work is carried out, we do not necessarily seek patent protection for all of our inventions in every jurisdiction in which we do business.
 
There can be no assurance that the validity of our patents will not be successfully challenged. Our business could be adversely affected by increased competition upon expiration of the patents or if one or more of our patents were adjudicated to be invalid or inadequate in scope to protect our operations. We believe in either case that our long experience with the proprietary processes, the strength of our trademarks and our degree of market penetration should enable us to continue to compete effectively in the pipeline rehabilitation, corrosion protection, energy, mining and infrastructure protection markets.
 
In both platforms, we have elected to maintain certain internally developed technologies, know-how and inventions as trade secrets. We have entered into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties to whom we disclose such trade secrets. Although there can be no assurance that these measures will suffice to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use or that third parties will not develop similar technologies, we believe it would take substantial time and resources to independently develop such technologies.
 
See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report for further discussion.
 
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, primarily on the basis of price, quality of service and capacity to perform. Many of our products and services face direct competition from competitors offering similar or essentially equivalent products or services. In addition, customers can select a variety of methods to meet their infrastructure installation, strengthening and rehabilitation needs, as well as their coating and cathodic protection needs, including a number of methods that we do not offer.
 
In the trenchless wastewater rehabilitation market, the CIPP process is one of the preferred rehabilitation methods. Because relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in this market, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. As such, there are numerous companies with which we compete. Worldwide, we compete with numerous smaller firms on local or regional levels and with several larger firms on the global and national levels. Despite the number of competitors, Insituform®, as the worldwide pioneer of this technology, has maintained its role as a market leader in North America and certain geographies outside North America.
 
In water rehabilitation, dig-and-replace is still the preferred method for the majority of customers. Because this is a more specialized field, with more barriers to entry, including strict government mandates, we compete primarily with a handful of global and national specialty contractors.
 
Our Fusible PVC® products compete against other more-traditional products in the pressure pipe market, such as HDPE and other restrained joint PVC pipe products.
 
In our infrastructure rehabilitation business, the FRP process competes against traditional methods of pipeline and structural retrofitting, but is gaining acceptance in the construction and retrofitting industries. With its proprietary technologies relating to both products and application, Fyfe is a leader in the FRP market and Fibrwrap Construction, having successfully performed installations of FRP systems for 25 years, is one of the most experienced applicators of the Tyfo® system and has a well-established reputation. In this field, there are barriers to entry, including testing requirements, experience, intellectual property and certifications. Fyfe has teamed with a number of universities around the world to conduct extensive product testing. In addition, Fyfe has dedicated significant resources to obtaining technical market acceptance of its proprietary products. As a result, Fyfe has received a number of certifications, including NSF certification for its Tyfo® system; International Code Council - Evaluation Service Report (ESR-2103), indicating product approval by the International Building Code; and compliance with ICC-AC125 guidelines for FRP strengthening. Because of the barriers to entry, Fyfe and Fibrwrap Construction tend to compete with a small number of companies on a regional or national level, most of which do not provide the full spectrum of services provided by Fyfe and Fibrwrap Construction.
 
In our Corrosion Protection segment, Corrpro operates in the highly-competitive field of cathodic protection for corrosion control. While this market is highly competitive, because there are relatively few barriers to entry, Corrpro is a recognized market leader in North America in this field. Competitors include a limited number of large firms, which provide services nationally and, in some instances, globally, although more prevalent are a number of small- and medium-sized firms with more limited portfolios of products and services, which are only provided on a regional or local level. Corrpro’s competitive advantage is its broad depth of high-quality cathodic protection offerings, including its cost-effective engineering, pipeline integrity, construction and coating services, which are provided to customers worldwide. We believe the advanced data collection and analytics capabilities associated with our asset integrity management program may also present a barrier to entry for smaller competitors.  
 
    14 

  

The process of utilizing thermoplastic liners is a prevalent method used to protect pipelines servicing the energy and mining industries. United Pipeline Systems is recognized as a leader in the thermoplastic liner market, having provided lining solutions on six continents. Due to barriers to entry arising from necessary technological capabilities, United Pipeline Systems mainly competes with a small number of specialty firms globally, nationally and regionally. Through our focused efforts on expanding our services worldwide, United Pipeline Systems enjoys significant name recognition and substantial market share in this industry in the key energy and mining regions of the world.
 
ACS has a strong presence in the field of FBE coating and is an industry leader in both inner diameter robotic coatings and outer diameter coatings. Because of these specialized fields, ACS usually competes with a small number of specialty providers.
 
There can be no assurance as to the success of our processes in competition with our competitors and alternative technologies for pipe installation and rehabilitation, coating, cathodic protection and infrastructure installation, strengthening and rehabilitation.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operations can be affected by seasonal variations and our results tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of each year due to typically milder weather in the regions in which we operate. We are more likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain, hurricanes or monsoons, snow and ice or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. However, these impacts usually have not been material to our operations as a whole. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report for further discussion.
Human Capital Management
 
Aegion’s core values are at the center of what we do, including how we manage our human capital. These values establish the foundation on which our culture is built and contribute to an environment that is committed to safety, fosters diversity and inclusion, promotes innovation and rewards performance. We believe our values, culture and commitment to our employees help to attract and retain a talented workforce that separates our Company, provides value to our stockholders and will continue to drive our long-term success.
Employee Demographics
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 4,138 employees worldwide (1,574 of which were associated with discontinued operations). Of those employees, 3,127 were located in the United States, 377 in Canada, 257 in the Middle East, 196 in the Asia-Pacific region, 162 in Europe and 19 in South America. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements that covered an aggregate of approximately 1,224 employees as of December 31, 2020. We generally consider our relations with our employees and unions to be good.
COVID-19 Impact
 
When the COVID-19 pandemic first presented in early 2020, we were faced with numerous unprecedented uncertainties regarding the pandemic’s impact on our near- and long-term financial outlook and liquidity. These challenges were exacerbated by the contemporaneous oil dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the consequential decline in oil prices.  In response, we took actions to protect the Company including actions that impact our human capital.  We implemented a hiring freeze, we furloughed about 15% of our North American workforce and we implemented some small-scope reductions in force. We also implemented temporary cash wage reductions for North American salaried employees and suspended employer contributions to 401(k) and other defined contribution plans.
 
As 2020 progressed, oil prices stabilized and we better understood the impact of the pandemic on our business.  As a result, we were able to bring back a majority of the furloughed workers, reverse the temporary cash wage reductions and reimburse employees for forgone wages and reinstate the employer contributions to 401(k) and other defined contribution plans. 
 
    15 

  

Safety
 
We believe that work-related accidents, incidents, injuries and illnesses are preventable and zero incidents are possible. Our core values promote a positive safety culture and are inherent in our approach to planning and executing projects worldwide, regardless of geographic location. To facilitate this approach, we have established, among other safety protocols, our “Focus Four,” a principles-based tool used by employees to help identify and mitigate hazards. Our Focus Four focuses on safety leadership, hand safety, hazard recognition, and body mechanics. We also have in place four main life-saving rules focused on fall protection, confined space, electrical lockout/tagout, and safe driving.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic introduced safety challenges beyond those of our normal operations.  At the onset of the pandemic, we adopted measures to improve the health and safety of our employees, clients and the communities we support. Our safety team promptly developed and executed against our COVID-19 pandemic response plan. We instituted safety protocols and procedures for the essential employees who continued to work at office and job sites and have updated our protocols to align with the evolving health and safety mandates.
 
The vast majority of our office staff has been able to effectively work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and any remaining office staff—as well as our field crews and laborers—have generally been able to continue working safely with the necessary protective equipment and practices. We have performed hazard assessments at each of our job sites to identify risk areas, primarily high-touch areas, and have taken steps to reduce the risk in each activity our employees performed. We have implemented many new safety processes, expanded disinfection and sanitization activities on our equipment and at our facilities and led a robust education program for all employees on personal hygiene practices. Field crews are provided proper personal protective equipment. Where outdoor activities do not allow for social distancing, face mask and shields are provided and required to reduce the spread of infection. In some cases, we have upgraded hotels for our crews to align with CDC recommended providers. In our manufacturing facilities, employees are provided protective gear and stations are sanitized multiple times each day. We have established medical hotlines for our workforce and continue to encourage employees whose job allows it to work from home to do so.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
Diversity and inclusion are embedded in our values and integrated into our strategies. We believe we will become better and achieve growth by intentionally creating a culture through acquiring and retaining a diverse workforce. As a global employer performing work in more than 80 countries and serving highly diverse communities, our team must reflect the world that we serve. We recognize it takes unique gifts, talents, varied perspectives, backgrounds and experiences to deliver innovative, high-quality products and services. In order to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, we focus our efforts on making diversity a part of our culture. Our efforts to increase diversity and expand on our commitments to employee engagement, inclusiveness, and openness include:

• | launching small group employee listening sessions hosted by our CEO and other senior leaders; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | providing unconscious bias training to management and human resources employees; 
• | endeavoring to communicate job openings across Aegion and to present a diverse slate of candidates for open positions; 
• | incorporating diversity reviews into succession planning reviews; 
• | announcing and celebrating promotions company-wide; and 
• | creating of a variety forums where employees are invited to submit new ideas to make Aegion more diverse and inclusive.

Compensation and Benefits
 
Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talented employees in the industry by offering competitive compensation and benefits. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay that include base salary, incentive bonuses with a pay for performance element and merit increases. As part of our long-term incentive plan for executives and certain key employees, we provide long-term equity awards tied to the value of our stock price, some of which are performance-based and tied to key financial metrics. We are also focused on the health and wellness of our employees.  As such, we offer eligible employees medical plans, dental and vision coverage, short-term and long-term disability insurance, term life insurance, employee assistance programs, flexible work schedules, remote work options, paid time off and a 401(k) plan or other defined contribution plan with a company match.  Additionally, we have in place a family scholarship fund to assist eligible employees’ children with college tuition expenses.
 
Commitment to Values and Ethics
 
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”). Our Code of Conduct requires a commitment from employees, officers and directors of Aegion, its subsidiaries, and its controlled joint ventures to conduct business honestly and ethically. Our Code of Conduct discusses the responsibility team members have to each other, to Aegion and its stockholders, and our customers, communities and governments. In his opening message in our Code of Conduct, our President and CEO confirms that no employee should ever fear asking questions or reporting concerns will have a negative impact on his or her employment and “we strictly forbid any kind of retaliation for making a good faith report.” In furtherance of our commitment to ethics and our employees, Aegion has a confidential hotline administered by an outside firm that an employee can call anonymously in the event he or she has ethical concerns or suspects instances of misconduct.
 
    16 

  

Communication and Engagement
 
We are committed to transparent and open communication with our employees and believe directly engaging our employees only benefits the Company by helping them understand the significant impact they have on our business and the Company’s overall performance. Accordingly, we communicate with our workforce through a number of ways, including corporate announcement emails, a regularly updated newsfeed on our intranet site and a quarterly company-wide “Global Town Hall” discussion hosted by our CEO and other senior leaders who review the prior quarter and answer employee questions.
Training and Development
 
We offer employees a variety of learning and development opportunities, including formal mentoring and leadership programs. Examples of these opportunities and programs include:
 

• | regularly scheduled “Developmental Coaching Conversations” where managers meet with their employees to discuss career growth, goals, and individual and team development; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | our “Blueprint for Leadership” program where company leaders are provided effective leadership practices through classroom learning, virtual learning, and on-the-job experiences; 
• | our online Learning Management System or “Knowledge Pipeline,” which provides employees access to training and development resources and webinars on a host of topics, including safety, goal setting and personal finance; and
• | certification programs to assist and guide employees to move into various roles within the company. 

Insurance and Bonding
 
We are required to carry insurance and provide bonding in connection with certain projects and, accordingly, maintain comprehensive insurance policies, including workers’ compensation, general and automobile liability and property coverage. We believe that we presently maintain adequate insurance coverage for all operations. We have also arranged bonding capacity for bid, performance and payment bonds. Typically, the cost of a performance bond is less than 1% of the contract value. We are required to indemnify the surety companies against losses from third-party claims of customers and subcontractors. The indemnification obligations are collateralized by unperfected liens on our assets and the assets of those subsidiaries that are parties to the applicable indemnification agreement.
Government Regulation
 
We are required to comply with all applicable United States federal, state and local, and all applicable foreign statutes, regulations and ordinances. In addition, our installation and other operations have to comply with various relevant occupational safety and health regulations, transportation regulations, code specifications, permit and licensing requirements and bonding and insurance requirements, as well as with fire regulations relating to the storage, handling and transporting of flammable materials. Our manufacturing and coatings facilities, as well as our installation and other operations, are subject to federal and state environmental protection regulations, none of which presently have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in connection with our present business. However, although our installation and other operations have established monitoring programs and safety procedures, further restrictions could be imposed on the manner in which installation and other activities are conducted, on equipment used in installation and other activities, on volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutant emissions from our paintings and coatings processes and on the use of solvents or the thermosetting resins used in the Insituform® CIPP process.
 
The use of both thermoplastics and thermosetting resin materials in contact with drinking water is strictly regulated in most countries. In the United States, a consortium led by NSF International, under arrangements with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), establishes minimum requirements for the control of potential human health effects from substances added indirectly to water via contact with treatment, storage, transmission and distribution system components, by defining the maximum permissible concentration of materials that may be leached from such components into drinking water, and methods for testing them. Our lining and coating products for drinking water use are NSF/ANSI Standard 61 compliant, including the entire Tyfo® system, the full range of Insituform® water pipe lining products and our Fusible C-900® and Fusible C-905® products.  In addition, our Tite Liner® HDPE system is certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61. Corrpro’s corrosion control products are NSF/ANSI Standard 61 classified for drinking water systems and its cathodic protection solutions for water storage tanks and water treatment units are compliant with AWWA Standard D104 and NACE recommended practices. NSF assumes no liability for use of any products, and NSF’s arrangements with the EPA do not constitute the EPA’s endorsement of NSF, NSF’s policies or its standards. Dedicated equipment is needed in connection with use of these products in drinking water applications.
