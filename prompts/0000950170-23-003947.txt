ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Glossary
 The following represents terms and statistics specific to our business and industry. They are used by management to evaluate and measure operations, results, productivity and efficiency.

ACMI | Service offering, whereby we provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs. 
Block Hour | The time interval between when an aircraft departs the terminal until it arrives at the destination terminal. 
C Check | “Heavy” airframe maintenance checks, which are more intensive in scope than Line Maintenance and are generally performed between 18 and 24 months depending on aircraft type. 
Charter | Service offering, whereby we provide cargo and passenger aircraft charter services to customers. The customer generally pays a fixed charter fee that includes fuel, insurance, landing fees, navigation fees and most other operational fees and costs. 
CMI | Service offering, whereby we provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, generally including the provision of crew, Line Maintenance and insurance, but not the aircraft. Customers assume fuel, demand and price risk, and are responsible for providing the aircraft (which they may lease from us) and generally responsible for Heavy and Non-Heavy Maintenance, landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs. 
D Check | “Heavy” airframe maintenance checks, which are the most extensive in scope and are generally performed every six or eight years depending on aircraft type. 
Dry Leasing | Service offering, whereby we provide cargo and passenger aircraft and engine leasing solutions for compensation that is typically based on a fixed monthly amount. The customer operates, and is generally responsible for insuring and maintaining, the flight equipment. 
Heavy Maintenance | Scheduled maintenance activities that are extensive in scope and are primarily based on time or usage intervals, which include, but are not limited to, C Checks, D Checks and engine overhauls. In addition, unscheduled engine repairs involving the removal of the engine from the aircraft are considered to be Heavy Maintenance. 
Line Maintenance | Maintenance events occurring during normal day-to-day operations. 
Non-heavyMaintenance | Discrete maintenance activities for the overhaul and repair of specific aircraft components, including landing gear, auxiliary power units and engine thrust reversers. 
Utilization | The average number of Block Hours operated per day per aircraft. 
Yield | The average amount a customer pays to fly one tonne of cargo one mile.

 On November 29, 2022, the shareholders of AAWW common stock adopted the Merger Agreement. We are working to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2023, and continue to make progress toward obtaining necessary approvals. We are awaiting final approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation (the "DOT") and have received all other required shareholder and regulatory approvals.
Operations
 Introduction. Our business is organized into two operating segments based on our service offerings: Airline Operations and Dry Leasing. Our segments are directly or indirectly engaged in the business of air transportation services but have different commercial and economic characteristics. Each operating segment is separately reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating results and make resource allocation decisions. Additional information regarding our reportable segments can be found in Note 14 to the Financial Statements.

Airline Operations. The core of our business is generally providing cargo aircraft outsourcing services to customers on an ACMI, CMI and Charter basis. Most arrangements provide us with guaranteed minimum revenues at predetermined rates, levels of operation and defined periods of time. ACMI, CMI and long-term Charter contracts generally provide a predictable annual revenue and cost base by minimizing the risk of fluctuations such as price, fuel and demand risk in the air cargo business. ACMI and CMI flying is typically based on guaranteed minimum Block Hours operated for a customer, while long-term Charter flying is for specific flight rotations between locations based on a guaranteed number of weekly or monthly flights. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our long-term Charter programs, which include indexed fuel price adjustments to mitigate our exposure to fuel price volatility. Our revenues and most of our costs under our contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, minimizing currency risks associated with international business.
All of our contracts provide that the aircraft remain under our exclusive operating control, possession and direction at all times. These contracts further provide that the routes to be operated may be subject to prior and periodic approvals of the U.S. or foreign governments. The original length of ACMI and CMI contracts generally ranges from two to seven years. The original length of long-term Charter program contracts generally ranges from two to five years. We also provide certain of these services on a short-term basis. In addition, Atlas provides limited airport-to-airport cargo Charter services to select markets, including several cities in Asia and South America, and occasionally earns revenue on subcontracted Charter flights.
 Dry Leasing. Our Dry Leasing business provides aircraft and engines to customers, including some CMI customers, for compensation that is typically based on a fixed monthly amount. This business is operated by Titan, which is principally a cargo aircraft dry lessor, but also owns and manages aviation assets such as engines and related equipment. In addition, Titan also markets its expertise in passenger-to-freighter conversions and other aviation-related technical services. Our Dry Leasing portfolio diversifies our business mix and enhances our predictable, long-term revenue and earnings streams.
 Other Revenue. Other revenue includes administrative and management support services and flight simulator training.
We believe that the scale, scope and quality of our outsourced services are unparalleled in our industry. The relative operating cost efficiency of our current 747-8F, 747-400F and 777-200LRF aircraft, including their superior fuel efficiency, range, capacity and loading capabilities, creates a compelling value proposition for our customers and positions us well in the markets we operate. Our fleet of 767-300 and 737-800 freighter aircraft are well suited for regional and domestic operations.
 We are focused on the further enhancement of all our services and we have the flexibility to expand our fleet in response to market conditions. In December 2021, we signed an agreement with The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) for the purchase of four new 777-200LRF aircraft. The first of the four new 777-200LRFs was delivered in November of 2022, with the other three expected to be delivered throughout 2023. In January 2021, we signed an agreement with Boeing for the purchase of four new 747-8F aircraft. The first three of these aircraft were delivered in May, October and November of 2022 and the last aircraft was delivered in January of 2023. All eight of these aircraft have been placed with customers under long-term contracts. We believe that our current fleet represents one of the most efficient, reliable freighter fleets in the market.
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have incurred and could incur further significant additional costs, including higher premium pay for pilots operating in certain areas significantly impacted by the pandemic and other operational costs, including costs for continuing to provide a safe working environment for our employees. In addition, COVID-19-related airport closures, employees who are unable to work, vaccine mandates, disruption of operations by our third-party service providers, availability of hotels and restaurants, ground handling delays or reductions in passenger flights by other airlines globally, have impacted and could have a further impact on overtime costs, crew travel costs and our ability to position employees to operate and fully utilize all of our aircraft. The continuation or worsening of the aforementioned and other factors has and could continue to materially affect our results for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For more information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see Item 1A, (“Risk Factors”) and Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) of this Report.
 Dry Leasing Joint Venture
Titan Aircraft Investments Ltd (“TAI”), is a long-term joint venture we entered into with investment funds managed by Bain Capital Credit, LP (collectively “Bain Capital”) to develop a diversified freighter aircraft Dry Leasing portfolio that aims to capitalize on demand for cargo aircraft, underpinned by robust e-commerce and express market growth.

Titan provides management services to the joint venture, including aircraft acquisitions, lease-management, passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversion oversight, technical expertise and disposal of aircraft. Titan’s expertise includes a wide range of freighters, as well as passenger aircraft that could be converted to freighters.
 The following table summarizes the aircraft types managed by us in TAI as of December 31, 2022:

Total | 11 

 DHL Investment and Polar
DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. (“DHL”) holds a 49% equity interest and a 25% voting interest in Polar (see Note 5 to our Financial Statements). AAWW owns the remaining 51% equity interest and 75% voting interest. Under a 20-year blocked space agreement that expires in 2028 (the “BSA”), Polar provides air cargo capacity to DHL. Atlas and Polar also have a flight services agreement, whereby Atlas is compensated by Polar on a per Block Hour basis, subject to a monthly minimum Block Hour guarantee, at a predetermined rate with the opportunity for performance premiums that escalate annually. Under the flight services agreement, Atlas provides Polar with crew, maintenance and insurance for the aircraft. Under separate agreements, Atlas and Polar supply administrative, sales and ground support services to one another. AAWW has agreed to indemnify DHL for and against various obligations of Polar and its affiliates. Collectively, these agreements are referred to in this Report as the “DHL Agreements”. The DHL Agreements provide us with a minimum guaranteed annual revenue stream from aircraft that have been placed in service with Polar for DHL and other customers’ freight over the life of the agreements. DHL provides financial support and also assumes the risks and rewards of the operations of Polar.
 Combined with Polar, we provide ACMI, CMI, Charter and Dry Leasing services to support DHL’s transpacific-express, North American, intra-Asian, and global networks. In addition, we fly between the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East and Europe on behalf of DHL and other customers. Atlas also provides incremental charter capacity to Polar and DHL from time to time. See Note 5 to our Financial Statements for a further discussion of our relationship with Polar.
 The following table summarizes the aircraft types and services provided to Polar and DHL as of December 31, 2022:
 

Aircraft | Service | Total
747-8F | ACMI | 6 
777-200LRF | CMI | 6 
777-200LRF | CMI and Dry Leasing | 2 
777-200LRF | Dry Leasing | 2 
767-300 | CMI and Dry Leasing | 2 
767-300 | CMI | 2 
Total | | 20 

Amazon
In May 2016, we entered into certain agreements with Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiary, Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc., (collectively “Amazon”), which involve, among other things, CMI operation of Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for Amazon by Atlas, as well as Dry Leasing by Titan. The Dry Leases have a term of ten years from the commencement of each agreement, while the CMI operations are for seven years from the commencement of each agreement (with an option for Amazon to extend the term to ten years).
In March 2019, we amended the agreements entered into in 2016 with Amazon, pursuant to which we provide CMI services using Boeing 737-800 freighter aircraft provided by Amazon. The 737-800 CMI operations have a term of seven years from the commencement of each agreement (with an option for Amazon to extend the term to ten years).
In conjunction with these agreements, we granted Amazon warrants providing the right to acquire shares of our common stock. See Note 9 to our Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements with Amazon.

Aircraft | Service | Total
767-300 | CMI and Dry Leasing | 17 
767-300 | Dry Leasing | 2 
737-800 | CMI | 8 
Total | | 27 

 Sales and Marketing
We have regional sales offices in various locations around the world that cover the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East regions. These offices market our ACMI, CMI, Charter and Dry Leasing services to express delivery providers, e-commerce retailers, the U.S. military, charter brokers, freight forwarders, direct shippers, airlines, manufacturers, sports teams and fans, and private charter customers.
Fuel
 Historically, aircraft fuel is one of the most significant expenses for us. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, fuel costs represented 33.2%, 24.9%, and 16.2%, respectively, of our total operating expenses. Fuel prices and availability are subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues, supply and demand, which we can neither control nor accurately predict.
 Our exposure to fluctuations in fuel price is limited to the shorter-term commercial portion of our Charter services, as fuel risk is largely mitigated by price adjustments, including those based on indexed fuel prices for longer-term commercial charter contracts. We do not incur fuel expense in providing ACMI and CMI services or in our Dry Leasing business as the cost of fuel is borne by the customer. Similarly, we generally have no fuel price risk for AMC charters because the price is set under our contract with the AMC, and we receive or make payments to adjust for price increases and decreases from the contractual rate.
 In the past, we have not experienced significant difficulties with respect to fuel availability. Although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of aircraft fuel, a number of factors, such as geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations and shortages of and disruptions to refining capacity or transportation of aircraft fuel from refining facilities, make accurate predictions unreliable. For example, hostilities and political turmoil in oil-producing nations could lead to disruptions in oil production or to substantially increased oil prices. Any inability to obtain aircraft fuel at competitive prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.
Human Capital
Our People
 Our business depends on our team of highly qualified flight and ground employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,500 employees, approximately 2,700 of whom were pilots. We maintain a comprehensive training program for our pilots in compliance with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) requirements, in which each pilot regularly attends recurrent training programs. In addition to the training programs provided to pilots, we also maintain comprehensive training programs for other safety-sensitive positions.
 Pilots of Atlas and flight dispatchers of Atlas and Polar, are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the “IBT”). These employees represented approximately 60% of our workforce as of December 31, 2022.
In March 2022, we signed a five-year collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with our pilots, effective as of September 2021. This long-term CBA was concluded through a binding interest arbitration process, with the arbitrator issuing a decision on September 10, 2021. The parties reached agreement on certain enhancements to the CBA in February 2022, which were incorporated into the CBA. The new pay rates became effective as of September 1, 2021, and we have continued to work closely together with the union’s new leadership on the final implementation of certain remaining provisions of the CBA. Under this industry competitive agreement, all of our pilots are receiving significantly higher pay, quality of life improvements and enhanced benefits. See Note 15 to our Financial Statements for further discussion of our labor matters.
 We also had a CBA with our Atlas and Polar dispatchers, which became amendable in November 2021. Shortly thereafter, the Company and the IBT commenced collective bargaining for a successor CBA pursuant to Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act. The parties reached agreement on a new five-year CBA, which was ratified by the dispatchers in August 2022. The new CBA with the dispatchers became effective as of September 1, 2022.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
 As an organization that carries the world, we care for the world we carry. Atlas seeks to foster a culture of inclusive diversity that is fundamental to attracting, retaining and developing the talent we need to fuel ongoing success. We value the individual differences represented by members of our workforce, and seek to ensure that our decision-making and strategic direction is informed by their unique perspectives. Underlying our DEI philosophy are five pillars of focus that serve as guiding principles for our DEI commitments: employee empowerment, learning and development, external advocacy, communication, and accountability and achievement. Our Employee and Executive Councils lead these important efforts.
 Our board of directors endorse the concept of board and committee refreshment, which has resulted in the election of several new board members and the rotation of the chairman of the board and the chairs of our three standing committees over the last three years. Our board is 60% diverse (40% ethnically diverse and 30% gender diverse). We believe that diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, background, professional experiences and perspectives is an important element in the board selection process.
 Health and Wellness
 In addition to comprehensive health and retirement benefits provided to eligible employees, our core benefits are supplemented with specific programs to encourage preventive care, improve common health conditions, and manage more advanced issues for improved outcomes. In addition, we offer a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide a number of wellness resources designed to promote physical, emotional and financial well-being that transitioned to virtual programs to provide increased accessibility.
Safety is our top priority. To ensure the highest level of safety for our employees, we established a Coronavirus Task Force (“CTF”) responsible for policies and procedures related to COVID-19. Through the CTF, we closely monitor the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and take numerous precautions to ensure the safety of our operations around the world.
 
To attract and retain a broader and more diverse employee population, we leverage a flexible working environment for all of our physical facilities, as necessary, including key locations in New York, Kentucky, Florida and Hong Kong. In addition to capturing operational efficiencies, hybrid and remote work allows us to create even more inclusive ways of working. At the same time, our physical work locations reinforce our Company culture and remain a fundamental ingredient to networking, development, brainstorming and team-building.
Aircraft Maintenance
Primary maintenance activities include scheduled and unscheduled work on airframes and engines. Scheduled maintenance activities encompass those activities specified in our maintenance program approved by the FAA. The costs necessary to adhere to these maintenance programs may increase over time, based on the age of the equipment or due to FAA airworthiness directives (“ADs”).
 Under the ADs issued pursuant to the FAA’s Aging Aircraft Program, we are subject to extensive aircraft examinations and may be required to undertake structural modifications to our fleet from time to time to address any problems of corrosion and structural fatigue. The FAA regularly issues inspection and maintenance requirements for aircraft depending on type, and ADs requiring certain additional aircraft modifications. We believe all aircraft in our fleet are in compliance with all existing ADs. It is possible, however, that additional ADs applicable to the types of aircraft or engines included in our fleet could be issued in the future and that the cost of complying with such ADs could be substantial.
Under our FAA-approved maintenance programs, all Heavy Maintenance is currently performed by third-party service providers that are compensated on a time-and-material or power by the hour basis as we believe they provide the most reliable and efficient means of maintaining our aircraft fleet.
 Insurance
We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts deemed adequate and consistent with current industry standards. Principal coverage includes: liability for injury to members of the public, including passengers; injury to crewmembers and ground staff; damage to our property and that of others; and loss of, or damage to, flight equipment, whether on the ground or in flight; and cyber business interruption.
 Aviation insurance premiums historically have fluctuated based on factors that include the loss history of the industry in general and the insured carrier in particular. We participate in an insurance pooling arrangement with DHL and its partners. This

allows us to obtain aviation hull and liability, war-risk hull and cargo loss, crew, third-party liability insurance and hull deductible coverage at reduced rates from the commercial insurance providers.
 Environmental, Social and Governance
 As a leading global provider of outsourced aviation operating services, we encounter and manage a broad range of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues. We have established an ESG policy and identified our efforts in our 2021 ESG Report, which can be viewed on our website, www.atlasairworldwide.com, under “Corporate Responsibility” in the “About Us” section.
Governmental Regulation
 General. Atlas and Polar (collectively, the “Airlines”) are subject to regulation by the DOT and the FAA, among other U.S. and foreign government agencies. The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service, such as certification, fitness and citizenship, competitive practices, insurance and consumer protection. The DOT has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority or seek criminal sanctions. The Airlines hold DOT-issued certificates of public convenience and necessity plus exemption authority to engage in scheduled air transportation of property and mail in domestic, as well as enumerated international markets, and charter air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. Atlas additionally holds worldwide passenger charter authority.
The DOT conducts periodic evaluations of each air carrier’s fitness and citizenship. In the area of fitness, the DOT seeks to ensure that a carrier has the managerial competence, compliance disposition and financial resources needed to conduct the operations for which it has been certificated. Additionally, each U.S. air carrier must remain a U.S. citizen by (i) being organized under the laws of the United States or a state, territory or possession thereof; (ii) requiring its president and at least two-thirds of its directors and other managing officers to be U.S. citizens; (iii) allowing no more than 25% of its voting stock to be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by foreign nationals; and (iv) not being otherwise subject to foreign control. The DOT broadly interprets “control” to exist when an individual or entity has the potential to exert substantial influence over airline decisions through affirmative action or the threatened withholding of consents or approvals. We believe the DOT will continue to find the Airlines’ fitness and citizenship favorable.
 In addition, the Airlines are required to hold valid FAA-issued air carrier certificates and FAA-approved operations specifications authorizing operation in specific regions with specified equipment under specific conditions and are subject to extensive FAA regulation and oversight. The FAA is the U.S. government agency primarily responsible for regulation of flight operations and, in particular, matters affecting air safety, such as airworthiness requirements for aircraft, operating procedures, mandatory equipment and the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers. The FAA monitors compliance with maintenance, flight operations and safety regulations and performs frequent spot inspections of aircraft, employees and records.
The FAA also has the authority to issue ADs and maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, increased security precautions, collision and windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. In addition, the FAA mandates certain record-keeping procedures. The FAA has the authority to modify, temporarily suspend or permanently revoke an air carrier’s authority to provide air transportation or that of its licensed personnel, after providing notice and a hearing, for failure to comply with FAA rules, regulations and directives. The FAA is empowered to assess civil penalties for such failures or institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations and directives. The FAA is also empowered to modify, suspend or revoke an air carrier’s authority on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing, where significant safety issues are involved.
International. Air transportation in international markets (the vast majority of markets in which the Airlines operate) is subject to extensive additional regulation. The ability of the Airlines to operate in other countries is governed by aviation agreements between the United States and the respective countries (in the case of Europe, the European Union (the “EU”)) or, in the absence of such an agreement, by principles of reciprocity. Sometimes, aviation agreements restrict the number of airlines that may operate, their frequency of operation, or the routes over which they may fly. This makes it necessary for the DOT to award route and operating rights to U.S. air carrier applicants through competitive route proceedings. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of existing route authorities or otherwise affect the Airlines’ international operations. Foreign government authorities also impose substantial licensing and business registration requirements and, in some cases, require the advance filing or approval of schedules or rates. Moreover, the DOT and foreign government agencies typically regulate alliances and other commercial arrangements between U.S. and foreign air carriers, such as the ACMI and CMI arrangements that Atlas maintains. Approval of these arrangements is not guaranteed and may be conditional. In addition, approval during one time period does not guarantee approval in future periods.

A foreign government’s regulation of its own air carriers can also affect our business. For instance, until recently, the EU placed temporal limits on the ability of EU carriers to use ACMI aircraft operated by airlines of non-EU member states. The regulations had a negative impact on our ACMI business opportunities.
Airport Access. The ability of the Airlines to operate suitable schedules is dependent on their ability to gain access to airports of their choice at commercially desirable times and on acceptable terms. In some cases, access is constrained by the need for the assignment of takeoff and landing “slots” or comparable operational rights. Like other air carriers, the Airlines are subject to such constraints at slot-restricted airports in cities such as Chicago and a variety of foreign locations (e.g., Amsterdam, Incheon, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo). The availability of slots is not assured and the inability of the Airlines or their ACMI and CMI carrier customers to obtain additional slots could inhibit efforts to provide expanded services in certain international markets. In addition, nighttime flight restrictions have been imposed or proposed by Hong Kong and various airports in Europe, Canada and the U.S. These could have an adverse operational or economic impact.
 Access to the New York airspace had presented an additional challenge in recent years even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of congestion in the New York area, especially at John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”), the FAA imposes hourly limits on JFK operations of those carriers offering scheduled services and potentially could place limits on Charter flights once traffic levels reach their pre-pandemic levels.
As a further means to address congestion, the FAA allows U.S. airports to raise landing fees to defray the costs of airfield facilities under construction or reconstruction. Any landing fee increases implemented would have an impact on airlines generally.
 Security. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and international regulatory bodies extensively regulate aviation security through rules, regulations and security directives that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to passenger and freighter aircraft and the introduction of prohibited items including firearms and explosives onto an aircraft. Atlas and Polar currently operate pursuant to a TSA-approved risk-based security program that, we believe, adequately maintains the security of all aircraft in the fleet. We utilize the TSA, the intelligence community and the private sector as resources for our aggressive global threat-based risk-management program. There can be no assurance, however, that we will remain in compliance with existing or any additional security requirements imposed by TSA or by U.S. Congress without incurring substantial costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. To mitigate any such increase, we are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to ensure that a risk-based management approach is utilized to target specific “at-risk” cargo. Additionally, foreign governments and regulatory bodies (such as the European Commission) impose their own aviation security requirements and have increasingly tightened such requirements. This may have an adverse impact on our operations, especially to the extent these requirements may necessitate redundant or costly measures or be in conflict with TSA requirements. We have successfully implemented all European Commission security programs allowing us unimpeded access to European markets. we screen all export cargo from the U. S. ensuring TSA regulatory compliance.
Environmental. We are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including the discharge of pollution, the disposal of materials and chemical wastes, the cleanup of contamination and the regulation of aircraft noise, which are administered by numerous state, local, federal and foreign agencies. For instance, the DOT and the FAA have authority under the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 and under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. We subscribe to the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) Balanced Approach for addressing aircraft noise, which was codified in 2001 and updated as recently as 2018. We believe that all aircraft in our fleet materially comply with current DOT, FAA and international noise standards.
We are also subject to the regulations in the U.S., by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and the international jurisdictions in which we operate regarding air quality. We believe that all of our aircraft meet or exceed applicable fuel venting requirements and other air emissions standards.
Various jurisdictions, including the EU, U.S. and other international governments and bodies, have implemented or are considering measures to respond to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.
In October 2016, ICAO approved and subsequently amended a resolution to adopt a global market-based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is designed to offset any annual increases in total carbon emissions from international civil aviation above a baseline level determined by 2019 emissions. Although various details regarding the implementation of CORSIA still need to be finalized and have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a pilot phase began in 2021 and will run through 2023. Starting in 2019, the Airlines have voluntarily begun tracking and reporting emissions in accordance with the CORSIA methodology in 2020, even though it is not yet mandatory in ICAO member countries. As a result, starting in 2024, the Airlines may need to purchase allowances to offset their share of

emissions overages based on the reporting for the 2021 to 2023 compliance period, which utilizes baseline emissions from 2019. For subsequent compliance periods, 85% of 2019 baseline emissions will be utilized.
 The EU continues to address climate change through its Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). Following the end of every year, to the extent the ETS applies, each airline must tender the number of carbon emissions allowances (“Allowances”) corresponding to carbon emissions generated by its covered flight activity during the year. If the airline’s flight activity during the year has produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of Allowances that it has been awarded, the airline must acquire Allowances from other airlines in the open market. In recognition of ICAO’s adoption of CORSIA, the ETS has been suspended with respect to flights to and from non-European countries continues through December 31, 2023. However, the ETS remains applicable to intra-European flights. Additionally, various European constituencies have begun to advocate for supplemental controls on aviation greenhouse gas emissions through additional taxation and similar measures.
In the U.S., various constituencies have continued to advocate for controls on greenhouse gas emissions. On August 15, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule finding that greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. It is possible that these or other developments could lead to the future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the U.S.
Other Regulations. Air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, we are subject to U.S. and foreign antitrust requirements and international trade restrictions imposed by U.S. presidential determination and U.S. government agency regulation, including the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”). We endeavor to comply with such requirements at all times. We are also subject to state and local laws and regulations at locations where we operate and at airports that we serve. Our operations may become subject to additional international, U.S. federal, state and local requirements in the future.
We believe that we are in material compliance with all currently applicable laws and regulations.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet. As part of our Charter business, Atlas and Polar both participate in the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize participants’ aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. Participation in the CRAF Program could adversely restrict our commercial business in times of national emergency. In August 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense activated the CRAF for the first time since 2002 to augment support to the U.S. Department of State in the evacuation of U.S. citizens and personnel, special immigrant visa applicants, and other at-risk individuals from Afghanistan. We provided three 747-400 passenger aircraft to support the CRAF activation, which ended in mid-September, and also provided additional 767 passenger aircraft in support of these evacuations for the AMC.
Under the CRAF Program, contracts with the AMC are for two-years with an option for the AMC to extend the contract for two additional two-year periods. We have made a substantial number of our aircraft available for use by the U.S. military in support of their operations and we operate such flights pursuant to cost-based contracts. Atlas bears all direct operating costs for both passenger and cargo aircraft, which include fuel, insurance, overfly, landing and ground handling expenses. The contracted charter rates (per mile) and fuel prices (per gallon) are fixed by the AMC periodically. We receive reimbursements from the AMC each month if the price of fuel paid by us to vendors for the AMC Charter flights exceeds the fixed price. If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the fixed price, then we pay the difference to the AMC.
 Airlines may participate in the CRAF Program either alone or through a teaming arrangement. We are a member of the team led by FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”). We pay a commission to the FedEx team, based on the revenues we receive under our AMC contracts. The AMC buys cargo capacity on two bases: a fixed basis, which is awarded both annually and quarterly, and expansion flying, which is awarded on an as-needed basis throughout the contract term. While the fixed business is predictable, Block Hour levels for expansion flying are difficult to predict and thus are subject to fluctuation.
 Future Regulation. The U.S. Congress, the DOT, the FAA, the TSA and other government agencies are currently considering, and in the future may consider, adopting new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations, ownership and profitability. It is impossible to predict what other matters might be considered in the future and to judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any future proposals or changes might have on our businesses.
Competition
The market for ACMI and Charter services, including long-term charter programs, is competitive. We believe that the most important basis for competition in this market is access to capacity, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the aircraft assets and

the scale, scope and quality of the outsourced operating services provided. Atlas is the market-leading provider of ACMI and Charter services utilizing the superior long-haul aircraft in the 747-8, 747-400 and 777 freighters. We will continue to develop new opportunities, including long-term charter programs, for aircraft not otherwise deployed in our ACMI business. Our primary competitors providing ACMI and Charter services for 777, 747, 767 and 737 freighter aircraft include the following: 21Air, LLC; Air Atlanta Icelandic; Air Transport Services Group, Inc.; Cargolux; Kalitta Air; National Air Cargo; Western Global Airlines; and other freighter operators.
Similar to the ACMI and Charter markets, the CMI market is also competitive. The most important basis for competition in this market is access to pilots, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the CMI solution and the scale, scope and quality of the outsourced operating services provided. We believe that we are the leading provider of such services to the market. Our primary competitors are operators that include Aerologic, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., Cargolux, Kalitta Air, Mesa Airlines, National Air Cargo, Sun Country Airlines and other airlines providing similar services.
The Dry Leasing business is also competitive with a large number of companies offering operating lease solutions globally. We believe that we have a competitive advantage as a leading lessor of freighter aircraft based on our extensive customer relationships in the airfreight market, our insights and expertise in aircraft types we operate, as well as access to capital, through our joint venture with Bain Capital, for funding the acquisition of incremental aircraft for conversion and leasing. Our primary competitors in the aircraft leasing market include AerCap Holdings N.V., Aero Capital Solutions, Altavair Air Finance, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., Avia AM, BBAM Aircraft and Leasing Management and Dubai Aerospace.
