About Our Business and How We Talk About It
 
We deliver interactive entertainment and innovative dining technology to bars and restaurants in North America. Our customers license our customizable solution to differentiate themselves via competitive fun by offering guests trivia, card, sports and single player games, nationwide competitions, and by offering self-service dining features including dynamic menus, touchscreen ordering and secure payment. Our platform can improve operating efficiencies, create connections among the players and venues and amplify guests’ positive experiences. Built on an extended network platform, our interactive entertainment system has historically allowed multiple players to interact at the venue, and now also enables competition between venues, referred to as massively multiplayer gaming. Our current tablet platform, which we refer to as Buzztime Entertainment On Demand, or BEOND, was first introduced as a pilot program in December 2012, was expanded commercially during 2013, and the expansion was scaled during 2014. We continue to enhance our network architecture and the BEOND tablet platform and player engagement paradigms. We also continue to support our legacy network product line, which we refer to as Classic.
 
We currently generate revenue by charging subscription fees for our service to our network subscribers, by leasing equipment (including tablets used in our BEOND tablet platform and the cases and charging trays for the tablets) to certain network subscribers, by hosting live trivia events, and by selling advertising aired on in-venue screens and as part of customized games. In 2014, we began offering pay-to-play single player games to certain customers. During the second quarter of 2015, we made a strategic change in our premium content model by making single player games available on both a free-to-consumer (in exchange for an increased subscription fee) and pay-to-play basis. This change required us to delay the general availability of pay-to-play games as we retooled its content, workflow and positioning. As a result, during 2015, we generated additional subscription fee revenue from those venues offering free-to-consumer single player games. We began rolling out the new pay-to-play single player games during the second quarter of 2016.


Over 136 million games were played on our network during 2016, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately 54% of our network subscriber venues are affiliated with national and regional restaurant brands, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Buffalo Wings & Rings, Old Chicago, Native Grill & Wings, Houlihans, Beef O’Brady’s, Boston Pizza, and Arooga’s.
 
We own several trademarks and consider the Buzztime®, Playmaker®, Mobile Playmaker, and BEOND Powered by Buzztime trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. These and our other registered and unregistered trademarks used in this document are our property. Other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Recent Developments
 
Amendments to East West Bank Credit Facility
 
In April 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with East West Bank, pursuant to which, we could request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount at any time up to the lesser of $7,500,000, which we refer to as the revolving line, or an amount equal to our borrowing base, in each case, less the aggregate outstanding principal amount of prior advances. In March 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the loan and security agreement to allow us the ability to request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount at any time up to the lesser of (a) $7,500,000, which we refer to as the revolving line, or (b) the sum of $2,000,000 (which we refer to as the “sublimit”) plus the amount equal to our borrowing base, in each case, less the aggregate outstanding principal amount of prior advances. The first amendment also amended certain financial covenants. In December 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the loan and security agreement to extend the due date of all advances under the revolving line from December 31, 2017 to January 15, 2018. In February 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the loan and security agreement to extend the maturity date of the $2,000,000 sublimit from March 31, 2017 to June 15, 2017, to establish the minimum adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, targets for each of our 2017 fiscal quarters, to remove the monthly compliance check of churn rate targets and to amend when compliance with minimum deposit amounts is measured. For additional information regarding this credit facility, see “PART II—ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below.
Registered Direct Offering
 
As previously reported, in a registered direct offering that closed on November 4, 2016, we sold 412,071 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million, after deducting estimated offering expenses. We are using and will continue to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and implementation of our strategic priorities.
 
Reverse/forward split of our common stock
 
At our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to give effect to, first, a reverse split of our outstanding common stock at an exchange ratio of 1-for-100 and, then, immediately following such reverse split, a forward split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio that is not less than 2-for-1 nor greater than 4-for-1, with the final ratio to be selected by our board of directors in its sole discretion. Our board of directors set the final ratio of the forward split at 2-for-1. We refer to the reverse split and to the forward split, together, as the “reverse/forward split.”
 
The effective date of the reverse/forward split was June 16, 2016. As of immediately prior to the reverse/forward split, we had 92,439,174 of common stock outstanding, and subsequent to the reverse/forward split, we had 1,848,597 shares of common stock outstanding. Approximately $3,000 was paid to cashed-out stockholders who owned less than 100 shares immediately prior to the reverse split.
 
Notice of non-compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standard
 
As previously reported, in November 2015, we received a letter from the NYSE Regulation Inc. stating that we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide because we reported stockholders’ equity of less than $6 million as of September 30, 2015 and had net losses in five of our most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2014. In December 2015, we submitted a plan to NYSE Regulation advising of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) by May 13, 2017. In January 2016, NYSE Regulation notified us that it has accepted our plan and granted us a plan period that extends through May 13, 2017 to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii).
 
In April 2016, as previously reported, we received a second letter from NYSE Regulation stating that we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide because we reported stockholders’ equity of less than $4 million as of December 31, 2015 and had net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015. As a result, we continue to be subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide. Because this instance of noncompliance is in addition to our noncompliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide discussed above, we were not required to submit a new compliance plan.

Under Section 1003(a)(i) of the Company Guide, the NYSE MKT will normally consider suspending dealings in, or removing from the list, securities of an issuer which has stockholders’ equity of less than $2 million if such issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. We had net losses in two of our three most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015. Our stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2016 was $1.8 million, and accordingly, we were below compliance with Section 1003(a)(i), as well. However, due to the offering discussed above, we raised approximately $2.7 million in that offering, and our stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2016 was approximately $4.1 million.
 
The listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT is being continued during the plan period pursuant to an extension. The NYSE Regulation staff reviews us periodically for compliance with initiatives outlined in our plan. If we are not in compliance with the listing requirements with which we are currently not in compliance by May 13, 2017 or if we do not make progress consistent with our plan during the plan period, NYSE Regulation staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock—Our common stock could be delisted or suspended from trading on the NYSE MKT if we do not regain compliance with continued listing criteria with which we are currently not compliant or if we fail to meet any other continued listing criteria,” below. We have continued to make progress consistent with our plan during the plan period. Raising capital in the offering discussed above is consistent with the initiatives outlined in our plan to regain compliance, however, the amount raised in that offering did not increase our stockholders’ equity to the amount required to regain compliance with all of the listing requirements in Section 1003(a). We are continuing to explore options to address our non-compliance, including by raising additional capital through additional equity financings.
 
Our Strategy
 
Below is a discussion of our strategy and highlights of current accomplishments and milestones achieved during 2016 and year to date in 2017:
 
Scale digital menu and payment functionality. We are heavily focused on delivering digital menu and payment functionality on the tablet platform, which we believe will improve the operational and marketing value of our product offering. This expanded functionality will help us deliver an enhanced guest experience. After ensuring our tablet met the Payment Card Industry, or PCI, compliance standards applicable to our platform, we launched a digital menu and payment functionality pilot test at Buffalo Wild Wings at 15 sites, which was completed in October 2016. Subsequent to the pilot test, we received certification on our EMV functionality, which enables additional payment security and fraud protection for our restaurant partners. In March 2017, we announced that Buffalo Wild Wings chose us to be its provider of digital menu, order, and payment functionality. Rolling out this functionality will be a key focus for us in 2017.
 
Improve value and price for our “independent” customers. During 2016, we continued to focus on, and we are continuing to focus on, entertainment, which is a key source of value to our independent customers. We entered into several partnerships during the year, which centered on driving guest traffic at our customer’s venues, increasing the guest community and improving loyalty. Such partnerships included the Washington Redskins, FanDuel, and Fandango.
 
With respect to price, we continued to make progress on our hardware design and quality in order to reduce expense and to give us the ability to offer flexibility in our pricing for quality independent customers. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began deploying our own proprietary tablet. Building our own tablet gives us control over the product specifications and allows us to gain control over the supply chain, which should help ensure stability, all of which has resulted in reduced hardware expenses and allowed us to offer multiple pricing options for our independent customers. Our proprietary tablet also gives us more flexibility to expand our product offering and enter adjacent markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Harbor Retirement Associates, LLC, which manages the HarborChase senior care communities, agreed to install our BEOND platform offering in all of its new communities. During 2017, we will continue working on hardware design and costs and enhancing our product offering on our new tablet platform, such as expanding the capabilities of our digital signage package and continuing to explore new adjacent markets.
 
Refine our commercial execution. We are focused on increasing our site count of both independent customers and chain customers. Receiving a reference from a national chain account, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, is critical to our chain efforts, and our ability to demonstrate Buffalo Wild Wings as a strategic user of the menu, order and pay functionality is critical to receiving that reference. For our independent customers, we continue to model and test our go-to-market efforts by improving our sales processes, technology and people. During 2016, we have made progress on ramping up our outbound sales team. We continue to make improvements in our demand generation programs and expect to see results from these programs in 2017. Additionally, we continue to work with our distribution partner Heartland Digital Dining. Through a dealer network, Digital Dining offers its own integrated restaurant management system as well as third-party offerings, such as our BEOND platform, to hospitality venues. During 2016, we became the only tableside menu, order, pay and entertainment platform that Digital Dining’s dealer network could offer to hospitality venues. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our BEOND platform to a few hospitality venues through this channel.

Monetize the network. We intend to grow the consumer audience by engaging them more with improved entertainment experiences and providing premium content that we can monetize through direct payment. In addition to the free-to-consumer games we provide to certain customers, we launched a pay-to-play premium games lobby during the second quarter of 2016 and are in approximately 500 sites as of March 7, 2017. We expect to continue rolling out the games lobby at additional sites throughout 2017, which we expect to result in accretive revenue from the consumers who play on a pay-to-play basis.
 
Additionally, we continued to leverage our network with on-tablet local and national advertising campaigns. Most recently, we completed a four-month Anheuser-Busch program called Let’s Go. This program was built around the NFL season, and our BEOND tablet platform was used to provide a companion to the NFL season with scores and stats available for a consumer’s favorite team. Let’s Go also added an interactive bobble head feature, where consumers could build and customize their own bobble head, complete with NFL licensed jerseys and gear. We believe this program demonstrated the power of brands connecting with target consumers and delivering great experiences for the consumers within the restaurant venues.


Competition
 
We face direct competition in venues and face competition for total entertainment and marketing dollars in the marketplace from other companies offering similar content and services. A relatively small number of direct competitors are active in the hospitality marketing services and entertainment markets, including Ziosk and E la Carte, Inc. Competing forms of technology, entertainment, and marketing available in hospitality venues include on-table bar and restaurant entertainment systems, music and video-based systems, live entertainment and games, cable, satellite and pay-per-view programming, coin-operated single-player games/amusements, and traffic-building promotions like happy hour specials and buffets.
 
In addition, we are increasingly competing with games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets.
 
Buzztime Significant Customer
 
Our customers range from small independently operated bars and restaurants to bars and restaurants operated by national chains. This results in diverse venue sizes and locations. As of December 31, 2016, 2,814 venues in the U.S. and Canada subscribed to our interactive entertainment network, of which, approximately 43% were Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees (collectively, “Buffalo Wild Wings”). For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, revenue generated from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------+-----------------------------+----------
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
Buffalo Wild Wings revenue | $ | 8,913,000 | | | $ | 10,889,000 | 
Percent of total revenue | | 40 | % | | | 44 | %

 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounts included in accounts receivable from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Buffalo Wild Wings accounts receivable | $ | 261,000 | | $ | 172,000

Backlog
 
We generally do not have a significant backlog because we normally can deliver and install new systems at hospitality locations within the delivery schedule requested by customers (generally within three to four weeks). However, during 2014, we encountered challenges with the assembly of the cases for our BEOND tablet, which prevented us from delivering and installing new systems within the 30 day period, thereby creating a backlog. As of December 31, 2014, customer agreements worth approximately $1,416,000 were affected by the backlog. We determined the worth of such agreements based on the sum of the annualized amount of the subscription fees, which is recognized as revenue as the service is provided, and the amount of equipment lease revenue, if any, subject to such agreements, which is recognized as revenue upon installation of the equipment leased. During 2015, we resolved the case assembly issue, and as a result, we returned to our normal delivery and installation schedule with no significant backlog.

Licensing, Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents
 
A majority of the gaming content available on our BEOND platform is internally developed. The balance is licensed from third parties. We also license third party content for our pay-to-play and free-to-consumer games lobby. The amounts paid for such third party licensed content was not material during either 2016 or 2015. All of the gaming content available on our Classic platform is internally developed.
 
Our intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, are important to our business and, accordingly, we actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products.
 
We keep confidential as trade secrets our technology, know-how and software. Some of the hardware we use in our operations is customized, and all of it is purchased from outside vendors. We enter into agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business, which contain provisions designed to protect our intellectual property and to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.
 
We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We consider the following United States patents to be important to the protection of our products and service:
 

Patent No. | Description | Expiration Date 
---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------
8,562,438 | System and method for television-based services | 4/21/2031

9,498,713 | User-controlled entertainment system, apparatus and method | 2/6/2034 

 
We have trademark protection for the names of our key proprietary programming, products, and services to the extent that we believe trademark protection is appropriate. We are expanding our efforts to protect these investments. We consider the Buzztime, Playmaker, Mobile Playmaker, BEOND Powered by Buzztime and PlayersPlus trademarks and our other related trademarks to be valuable assets, and we seek to protect them through a variety of actions. Our content, branding, and some of our game titles, such as Countdown, SIX, and Showdown are also protected by copyright and trademark law.

Government Contracts
 
We provide our content distribution services through the Buzztime network to colleges, universities, and a small number of government agencies, typically military base recreation units. However, the number of government customers is small compared to our overall customer base. We provide our products and services to government agencies under contracts with substantially the same terms and conditions as are in place with non-government customers.
Government Regulations
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local laws has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date. In December 2012, we received approval from the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, for our BEOND tablet charging trays, and in September 2015, we received FCC approval for our third generation BEOND tablet cases with and without payment electronics. The BEOND tablets we currently use have been certified by its manufacturer.
 
In addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply directly to the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. Additionally, state and federal governments may adopt additional laws and regulations that address issues related to certain aspects of our business such as:
 

● | user privacy; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | copyrights; 
● | gaming, lottery and alcohol beverage control regulations; 
● | consumer protection; 
● | the distribution of specific material or content; and 
● | the characteristics and quality of interactive entertainment products and services. 

 
As part of our service, we operate games of chance and games of skill. These games are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. Our games are played just for fun and winner recognition. None of our games award anything of value to winners. Included in our offering are a number of interactive card games, such as Texas Hold’em poker. These card games are restricted in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations that govern these games, however, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change, as well as law enforcement discretion. We may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, or cancel certain components of our products in certain states or jurisdictions based on changes in law, regulations and law enforcement discretion, which could result in additional development costs and/or the possible loss of customers and revenue.
 
Web Site Access to SEC Filings
 
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, and proxy statements and other information we file or furnish pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available on our website at www.buzztime.com/business/investor-relations/ under the heading SEC Filings as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. In addition, we make available on that same website under the heading Corporate Governance our (i) our code of conduct and ethics; (ii) our corporate governance guidelines; and (iii) the charter of each active committee of our board of directors. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of our code of conduct and ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the code of ethics definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of Item 406 of Regulation S-K by posting such information on that website.
 
Materials we file with the SEC may also be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC.
 
Employees
 
As of March 7, 2017, we employed approximately 109 people on a full-time basis and 293 people on a part-time basis. We also utilize independent contractors for specific projects. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Our Corporate History
 
NTN Buzztime, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as Alroy Industries and changed its corporate name to NTN Communications, Inc. in 1985. The name was changed to NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2005 to better reflect the growing role of the Buzztime consumer brand.
