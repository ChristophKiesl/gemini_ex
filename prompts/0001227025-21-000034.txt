Overview: Our Position in Advanced Communications
We develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit and receive high-speed digital optical signals for Cloud and hyperscale data center internet content provider and telecom networks. We are the world's primary supplier of tunable lasers that emit the ultra-pure light that is required for the highest speed over distance fiber optic communications links. 
Cloud and hyperscale data center networks are operated by such companies as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Tencent, while telecom networks are operated by such telecommunications carriers as AT&T, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, NTT Communications, Telefonica and Verizon. As operators of large scale high-speed communications networks, these companies are end-users of NeoPhotonics products. Our direct customers can be these companies, their contract manufacturers or their network equipment suppliers, including such companies as Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Huawei Technologies, Nokia and ZTE. These network equipment manufacturers and their engineering and manufacturing suppliers ("EMS") have historically been our primary customers. However, as we integrate our products into more complete solutions, we expect rising revenues directly from operators of high-speed communications networks.
The world’s leading suppliers of network equipment and coherent transceiver products directly or indirectly use NeoPhotonics ultra-pure light tunable lasers for their highest speed coherent solutions, and most of them use our integrated modulator and receiver components. 
Our high-speed products support the explosive growth of data traffic in Cloud and hyperscale data center networks. Our laser market penetration has increased substantially over the last five years, and our ultra-pure light lasers have been adopted by nearly all leading network equipment manufacturers for their 400G and above systems. In addition to our leadership in ultra-pure light tunable lasers, we have been increasing our market position with these companies in modulator and receiver components. Over the last two years, many of these network equipment manufacturers have adopted our 64 Gbaud receiver and modulator components, together with our tunable laser, for their highest speed systems. 
Our products operate at the highest speed over distance, at speeds of 400 Gigabits per Second ("G"), 600G and 800G and beyond data rates. Versions of these products have the speed, size and low power consumption that enable interoperable 
pluggable transceivers in standard form factors which directly transmit data using industry standard Internet Protocol coding, or IP over DWDM wavelengths, greatly simplifying data networks, thereby lowering costs and reducing power consumption.
NeoPhotonics 400G and above revenue nearly doubled in 2020 over 2019, from $44 million in 2019 to $86 million in 2020, such that revenue from products for 400G and above applications are now approaching half of our current revenues. We believe that the market for 400G and above products will grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 70 percent through 2024. We therefore expect our 400G and above revenues will continue to grow at an accelerated rate over the immediate and longer term.
Over the past decade we have been first to deliver commercial mass production volumes for each of the highest speed advances in coherent optical components, as maximum speeds have advanced for each wavelength, or color, from 100G to 200G, 400G and now 800G. We are a specialist in developing and producing products for the highest speed over distance applications, where high baud rate and high sensitivity are keys to achieving longer distances for a given speed.
We believe we are well positioned to continue world market leadership in these laser, component and module solutions based on our leadership in the ultra-pure light lasers which power them and our comprehensive Silicon Photonics and Indium Phosphide technologies for optical ICs. 
Our Technology and Product Position
Our high-speed optical communications technologies encode information onto optical signals from electronic signals for transmission and decode it for receiving. We achieve ultra-high speed data transmission using coherent technology that encodes phase, amplitude and polarization on an optical wavelength, packing in orders of magnitude more information than is possible with simple on/off encoding. With the inherent characteristics in our ultra-pure light tunable lasers, we achieve longer distance transmission as well as higher speed.
Coherent is the technology of choice for high speed over distance data transmission in Cloud infrastructure and data center interconnection, in addition to telecom networks. The move to 400G and above transmission is a fulcrum for the industry as it marks the next major step-up in speed. 400G is the basic building block for network deployments for all reaches from 40km to long haul distances, all of which require coherent transmission technology.
We believe we are a global leader in coherent transmission technology, based on our leadership in ultra-pure light lasers and optical integration for miniaturization and low power consumption. We sell to virtually all of the leading telecom network equipment companies such as Acacia Communications, ADVA, Ciena, Cisco Systems, Fiberhome, Fujitsu, Huawei, Infinera, NEC, Nokia and ZTE. As the primary producer of ultra-pure light lasers, we have delivered approximately 2 million lasers into the market of slightly more than 3 million coherent ports deployed by the industry over the past 10 years (each port may use either one or two lasers). 
Our High Speed Products, including our 400G and above products, use our Silicon Photonics integration, Indium Phosphide integration and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technologies to optimize performance by combining different materials platforms. We believe that our use of all of these technologies is an important competitive differentiator, as together they support optimizing cost and performance. 
The development of the market for the uses of 400G and above solutions has two key paths. First is the use of 400G, 600G, 800G and beyond products in chassis-based systems, including systems that support long distance transmission. This is the path for continuing expansion of carrier deployments for highest speed over distance. Second is the use of 400G pluggable modules as the basic building block for communications infrastructure providing direct connection of routers and switches within and between data centers. These DCI interconnects, using 400ZR and 400ZR+ pluggable modules, enable new, lower cost network architectures using IP over DWDM protocols. Both of these paths portend accelerating growth.
The emergence of 400ZR and 400ZR+ pluggable modules extends our capabilities to a new, rapidly expanding market segment. Such modules put full coherent transmission capabilities of a line card into the same form factor as a pluggable client side transceiver, enabling interconnects between data centers to be as simple as interconnects within a data center, thereby substantially reducing costs.
Such modules are causing a sea change in the market structure. Signal processors and optics have both progressed to the extent that they are small enough, and their power consumption is low enough, to enable architectures that fully leverage new, much smaller form factors to deliver a major increase in data rates and scale while minimizing any need for macro power demands. As a result, for the first time, hyperscaler data center operators and telecom carriers can re-architect their networks with much greater capability to manage the exploding demand for data transmission.
Use cases for 400ZR and 400ZR+ system level modules extend across data center interconnect, backhaul for 5G wireless networks and metro networks. Key attributes of power and power density, and interoperability of pluggable solutions, drive this forecast. These architectures are driven by hyperscaler operators and will be adopted in metro telecom networks using 400ZR+ pluggable modules in areas where reach and density make it the clear economic winner with much lower total costs. Furthermore, we believe that our high performance optics combined with next generation digital signal processor ("DSP") will enable 800ZR and 800ZR+ pluggable modules with the next few years.
We believe that Cloud and hyperscale data center operators, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Tencent, could become significant customers as they increasingly link-up hyperscale data centers regionally. These operators need the highest speeds at reaches up to 120 kilometers, defining a market sector where we excel and have fundamental technology advantages. We believe the Cloud and hyperscale data center markets will become more important in our sales mix, from our further penetration of this market and the higher potential revenue growth rate it represents.
Furthermore, extension of coherent modules into metro networks will be driven by substantially lower costs achieved through elimination of network equipment proprietary chassis, and the reduction in the number of ROADMs required, compared to current network architectures. 
With 400G as a fulcrum in the path of growth in the market at the highest speeds, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this rapidly developing, high growth market.
Hyper Growth of Data Traffic in the Information Age
 In the information age, almost every realm of knowledge and of economic and social life is being digitized, creating previously unimaginable amounts of data, and requiring new applications that drive massive data manipulation that continue to emerge and expand. These include applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, smart homes, tele-medicine, genomics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
The massive infrastructure of hyperscale data centers necessitates extremely high capacity optical interconnections. There are well over 500 hyperscale data centers around the world, each housing 100,000 or more computational micro-processors. Each hyperscale data center is surrounded by many more enterprise-level data centers. This vast proliferation of data applications is expected to continue to drive growth in hyperscale and enterprise data centers for decades to come.
The ability to generate and process data requires that the data be transported to where it is needed. Thus, the second major element of the Cloud is the communications interconnections between data centers and consumers and between the data centers themselves.
Total annual IP data traffic is forecast to reach 4.8 Zettabytes by 2022, or 4.8 trillion billion bytes (which is roughly equivalent to 200 million times the data in the Library of Congress) according to the Cisco Visual Networking Index. Total data traffic is forecast to nearly double over the next three years, with nearly all of this data being carried over fiber optic communication links. 
Networks operating at 400G, 600G, 800G and beyond data rates have adopted coherent transmission technology because of its ability to increase data rates and lower costs. With the explosion of data traffic, these high-speed optical networks are very high growth segments of the optical communications market. They support the continuing rapid expansion of telecom backbone, hyperscale data center and content provider networks, accommodating increased mobile traffic for the foreseeable future. 
Distance Matters
Our solutions are often unique in their ability to service the need for this explosive growth in data traffic by providing high integrity signals across longer distances. It is more challenging and expensive to transmit a signal a thousand kilometers or across a continent than it is to send the same information a few hundred meters across a data center or campus network. 
For speed over distance, state of the art and best of breed optics are essential, and increasingly so as distances extend and data rates increase. For distances of 80 kilometers to a few hundred kilometers, i.e. ZR and ZR+ distances; then further to 2000 kilometers, or long haul reaches, specialized technologies are needed for each. The benefits of coherent transmission have made it the preferred technology for these state-of-the-art high-speed over distance networks. We believe that our Silicon Photonics Integration and our ultra-pure light tunable lasers are enabling technologies, and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technologies effectively address the challenges inherent in precision and high volume manufacturing of optical components for coherent transmission when distances extend to the longest reaches.
Emerging Change in Network Architecture
We believe the changes at 400G and above data rates portend a coming sea change in high-speed network architectures to more efficiently implement the 400G and above technologies we provide. We believe our coherent techniques and photonic integrated circuits, or PICs, will enable this forecasted significant change in network architecture. Today, a data center or central office equipment rack contains complex and self-contained elements as the key parts of chassis-based systems. These circuit boards or line cards, are usually supplied by a separate network equipment manufacturer, or NEM, to provide the fiber optic link. However, this results in a complex and costly architecture. 
Our advanced system-level coherent modules for the highest speeds and longest distances provide a core communications link solution for interconnecting data centers separated by 80 kilometers or more. As such, they carry stringent performance and reliability requirements that are higher than traditional short reach data center modules.
Our integration technologies make it possible for long distance transmission by pluggable transceiver modules that connect directly into switches and routers inside data centers that have thus far been used only for short reach connections within data centers. Such disaggregated Open Line Systems can manage optical signals between data centers, sometimes called IP over DWDM, with all needed channel management, amplification, traffic planning and monitoring functions. Connections between data centers then become as simple as connections within data centers which is a major breakthrough in reducing costs.
To illustrate, a 400G connection between two routers in different data centers 80 kilometers apart can be made by plugging our 400ZR DD-QSFP pluggable transceiver into each router and connecting the fibers through an Open Line System. Similarly a distance of 400 kilometers or more can be accommodated using our 400ZR+ modules. 
400ZR/ZR+ ARCHITECTURE FOR DATA CENTER INTERCONNECT
Architecture Supported by 400ZR Interconnects for direct connection to Routers or Switches
This architecture eliminates two complex network equipment boxes and four short reach data center transceivers and consequently reduces the cost per bit of the optical link by as much as 80 percent. The architecture is possible because coherent technology, driven by our ultra-pure light lasers and coupled with our highly integrated photonic chips, package the long distance transmission capability of the NEM line card into a small form factor pluggable transceiver that is plug-compatible with standard short reach data center transceivers. For example, a NeoPhotonics 400ZR QSFP-DD or OSFP module capable of 80 kilometer transmission plugs into the same slot on a router that also accommodates a 400G DR4 QSFP-DD or OSFP data center transceiver capable of only 500 meters transmission. Being able to utilize the same plug receptacle for both short reach connections and long reach connections is a major cost-saving breakthrough for network operators.
We believe that this connection architecture will become the mainstay of new installations over the next few years, moving a significant portion of the capital expenditures from network equipment supplied DWDM proprietary boxes to disaggregated direct 400ZR interconnections. This approach of IP over DWDM moves Internet Protocol traffic from switches and routers directly over an Open Line System DWDM channel to its destination without passing through a proprietary network equipment transmission chassis. 
Broad adoption of 400ZR architectures for DCI applications also portends changes in future metro architectures. For example, 5G wireless applications require an ultra-flexible network that can be dynamically provisioned to implement disparate functions. The most efficient way to implement such a network is through a Cloud architecture which enables traffic to be managed at the packet level. A transport grade 400ZR+ pluggable module allows a metro-level connection to be plugged directly into a switch or router. The traffic then goes directly to a ROADM-based Open Line System, creating a very flexible optical network with a lower total cost of deployment. We believe this new metro architecture will result in a similar magnitude of cost savings as is anticipated in 400ZR DCI networks.
These imminent changes drive the increasing forecasts of 400ZR+. We believe that the volumes of 400ZR+ interconnects will approach the volumes of 400ZR by 2024, thereby driving a significant increase in the total addressable market we serve.
Our Solutions
We leverage our range of optical integration technologies to develop and produce integrated optical products that deliver the highest speed over distance. Our products work together as solutions to achieve highest speed and highest performance. To maximize total capacity, we provide additional Line System solutions that leverage our coherent products together with our passive products to maximize total fiber capacity.
Three critical optical components are required to make a coherent transceiver: (1) a laser with a very narrow linewidth and very pure light; (2) a coherent modulator capable of changing both the intensity and phase of the optical signal to code data onto it; and (3) a coherent receiver capable of detecting both the intensity and phase of the received optical signal to “interpret” its content, plus an electronic DSP IC. 
We have been a leading volume supplier of these optical components since coherent systems were first deployed in volume in the telecommunications networks of a decade ago. We are now the primary supplier of ultra-pure light lasers and 
coherent receivers to the coherent market, and we have introduced high performance and high-speed coherent modulators for 400G, 600G and 800G applications. 
These high performance coherent optical components and ultra-pure light tunable lasers require very specialized materials platforms and assembly capabilities. As such, there are only a very limited number of companies in the world capable of designing and manufacturing them. We believe that we have a unique set of materials, design, assembly and test capabilities for ultra-pure light tunable lasers, coherent modulators and receivers as well as optical ICs that form the basis of our competitive position.
In parallel, commercial DSP development has followed Moore’s Law to achieve the performance and low power necessary for 400ZR and 400ZR+ coherent modules. The latest generation of DSPs incorporate forward error correction software standardized by the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) so that they can interoperate. This means that the data traffic can remain in IP format and be directly communicated between switches and routers without passing through a proprietary network equipment chassis, thereby accelerating adoption of IP over DWDM adoption. 
As these DSPs are based on standard commercial CMOS IC processes and design tools, the number suppliers of DSPs has grown. There are at least three large-scale merchant suppliers of DSPs, and at least three captive DSP suppliers within system companies. Other suppliers may enter the DSP market.
We combine our unique high performance ultra-pure light tunable lasers with a coherent modulator and receiver, or with a combined silicon photonics COSA, together with a commercially available DSP to manufacture 400ZR modules. These are available in multiple form factors including 400G CFP2 and DD-QSFP and OSFP digital coherent optical (“DCO”) transceivers. Our QSFP-DD and OSFP modules are designed to be extendable to 800ZR and 800ZR+ applications, and we believe that such 800G pluggable modules will enter the market within the next few years as next generation DSPs become available.
Increasing Fiber Capacity
There are two approaches to optimizing the data carrying capacity in a fiber. The first approach addresses capacity by increasing the data rate in a given channel using higher baud rate and higher order modulation. Once this limit is reached, the second approach is to expand the wavelength range available, which is achieved by increasing the wavelength tuning range to accommodate more channels. This maximizes the data carrying capacity in any given fiber and lowers overall cost per bit.
The first approach addresses capacity as speed per channel, and uses our 64 Gbaud and 96 Gbaud modulators and receivers and our ultra-pure light tunable lasers. As baud rates increase, however, the channels must be made “wider” to accommodate the signal spread, thereby reducing the number of channels that can be “fit” in a given fiber’s bandwidth using standard optics. 
The second approach addresses the number of channels, where we combine coherent transmission technologies to maximize interconnect bandwidth capacity. For example, our C++ LASERTM ITLA, C++ CDMTM Modulator and C++ ICRTM Receiver are uniquely capable of increasing fiber capacity up to 50 percent and to deliver up to 32 Terabits per second of capacity over a single fiber. The number of channels is further optimized by our precision 75 to 100GHz-spaced PLC multiplexers for Open Line Systems. 
The capabilities of coherent optics continue to grow with increasing photonic integration for higher performance and smaller size, and open further opportunities for us in adjacent markets. Outside of communications, coherent technology improves sensitivity and performance for a variety of applications including inter-satellite communication links including for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, plus industrial applications, 3D sensing for autonomous vehicle navigation, and medical imaging. 
Our Core Technologies in Silicon Photonics and Hybrid Photonic Integration 
We believe we have all the capabilities required for producing the highest performance Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integrated optoelectronic and silicon photonics devices for the highest speeds and highest speed over distance and meeting the most stringent performance requirements. Our core technologies are a unique multi-material platform that includes:
Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration: Provides our core technology and drives our ability to design, develop and produce industry leading, unique and differentiated high-speed optoelectronics products. We utilize proprietary integration platforms that provide optoelectronic functionality on Silicon and compound semiconductor substrates including Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide and Silicon Germanium. Complete advanced photonics integration capability requires integrated combinations of these platforms to achieve optimal performance and cost. 
High Performance Optics and Ultra-Pure Light Lasers: Reduces the need for electronic algorithms from digital signal processors, or DSPs, to correct less pure optical signals, thereby improving performance, cost and power consumption. 
Silicon Photonics Integration: Silicon is versatile for photonic integration. Silicon Photonics integrated circuits must be designed to be integrated with lasers fabricated from Indium Phosphide, detectors based on germanium-doped silicon, or other 
functions and materials through Hybrid Photonic Integration. We design Silicon Photonics modulators, receivers, coherent optical subassemblies and laser subassemblies and fabricate the Silicon wafers in commercial Silicon foundries. 
Indium Phosphide (InP): Indium Phosphide is used to produce efficient lasers, sensitive photodetectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications. As a compound semiconductor bandgap material, InP is the most important material for the generation of laser signals and the detection and conversion of those signals back to electronic form. We design and manufacture laser and detector chips in our own Indium Phosphide fabs and integrate them with silicon photonics circuits using Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration. 
Silicon Planar Lightwave Circuits: Silicon is a multi-attribute material and waveguides of Silicon or doped Silicon Dioxide (silica) have very low optical loss and are ideal for switching, filtering or interferometric applications. We design and manufacture doped silica photonic chips and integrate them with photonic circuits using Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration.
Gallium Arsenide (GaAs): Gallium Arsenide operates at very high speeds due to its high electron mobility and is used to make analog integrated circuit drivers for high-speed lasers and modulators. We design and manufacture GaAs ICs and integrate them with our lasers and modulators or into co-packaged optoelectronics devises, or CPO.
Silicon Germanium (SiGe): Silicon Germanium is used to manufacture mixed signal and analog integrated circuits for high-speed drivers and trans-impedance amplifiers used in 400G and beyond systems. We design SiGe ICs and fabricate wafers in commercial SiGe foundries.
Laser Technologies: We specialize in the design, manufacture and control of lasers. Our principle products include ultra-pure light tunable lasers, electro-absorptively modulated lasers (EMLs) and distributed feedback lasers (DFB). 
Optoelectronic engineering and integration: As we create complex integrated optoelectronic devices, we design and build electronic control algorithms and devices, signal processing methodologies, hardware and software routines and protocols, and device level ASICs that function to control and manage the highest performance features and capabilities of these integrated optoelectronic devices and systems. 
Hardware and firmware integration: We sell our products as modules and subsystems which contain electronic hardware and firmware controls that interface directly with our customers’ systems. 
Devices, Components, Modules and Subsystems: We design and manufacture modules and subsystems that combine our products with other elements to offer customers a complete solution.

Our Products
Our ultra-pure light tunable lasers are core to our coherent communications strategy, and our other coherent components and modules provide industry leading performance and are forward integrations of our lasers. As data rates increase by increasing baud rate and modulation order, it is essential to have the purest possible laser light source. Our ultra-pure light tunable lasers deliver to this essential requirement by having the narrowest linewidth in the industry, meaning the purest color, without noise or other distortion.
We produce transmitter and receiver components and modules, as well as switching products, for 400G and beyond transmission over distances of 2 to 2,000 kilometers. We integrate transmitter and receiver components into next generation pluggable transceiver modules. 
All of our high-speed 400G and beyond products are based on our Silicon Photonics technology and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology. Our coherent technologies support encoding 400 Gigabits or more per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver, and enable smaller, more compact and more highly integrated designs for the individual elements and integrated COSAs.
Coherent transmission can only be accomplished in practice using advanced photonic integration to intimately couple functional elements. Coherent systems manipulate light to encode orders of magnitude more the amount of information on the same wavelength channel than is possible with traditional methods. 
Our Coherent Products include our Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable Lasers (NLW-TL), Coherent Modulators and Integrated Coherent Receivers. Our Tunable Lasers generate the ultra-pure wavelength, or color, necessary for coherent transmission; Coherent Modulators encode the electronic information based on the polarization, phase and amplitude of the optical beam; and Integrated Coherent Receivers (ICRs) decode the phase and polarization of the encoded coherent optical signal. 
Our coherent optoelectronic modules, which integrate our components, provide complete transmit and receive functions including variable modulation capability to adjust data rates. Compact integration of our “transceiver” modules allows them to be pluggable and to reduce costs by replacing traditional much larger and more complex chassis. 
Each of our module products incorporates one each of our component lasers, integrated coherent receivers and modulators. Further, to minimize size, we often integrate the receiver and modulator into a single component, or a COSA. In addition, each transceiver module has a DSP as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). These four elements, three components and the DSP, comprise most of the bill of materials for a module, and are roughly comparable in value.
DIGITAL COHERENT TRANSCEIVER
Elements of a Digital Coherent Interconnect Transceiver Module
We develop and manufacture Transmitter Products, Receiver Products and Switch Products that are used in ultra-high speed digital optical communications, high-speed switching and provisioning. We combine our transmitter and receiver products into Transceiver modules. Our Switching Products, such as Multi-Cast Switches, are used primarily in ROADM nodes that dynamically and efficiently allocate bandwidth to adjust for fast changing traffic patterns and for provisioning software defined optical networks. Our products can be categorized into groups, including High Speed Products for 100G, 400G, 600G, 800G and beyond applications, including in coherent networks, including the switches for these applications, and Network Products and Solutions, both for lower speed networks, and wavelength management solutions for telecom and DCI networks, as well as specialty instrumentation products.
Our High Performance Coherent Module Products
400G Pluggable Coherent Transceivers: We produce pluggable coherent transceivers operating at speeds from 100G to 400G. We produce high speed and high performance pluggable coherent modules which combine our ultra-narrow linewidth laser with our coherent receiver and with our high performance coherent modulator or integrated COSA. 
Our 400ZR OSFP and our new QSFP-DD transceivers both provide 400G connections over a DCI reach of up to 120 kilometer in a standard client side pluggable form factor. These modules support OIF standard error correction software and can interoperate with other transceivers using the same standardized software, enabling direct IP over DWDM.
Our 400G capable CFP2-DCO transceiver can deliver as much as 32 Terabits per second of capacity per fiber. Our internal optics support 85 channels of 64 Gbaud data at 75 GHz wavelength channel spacing. These CFP2-DCO modules support long haul, metro and DCI network applications. Our 100G CFP provides metro reach connections in a standard CFP form factor.
Our Ultra-Pure Light Laser Products 
Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable Laser Products: We produce industry-leading tunable laser products based on an external cavity design (ECL). Due to their longer cavity length, ECLs generate a pure “color,” or narrower “linewidth,” which 
is critical with new higher order modulation techniques and higher baud rates, and thereby carry significantly more information. We produce standard Micro-ITLA form factor and a smaller Nano-ITLA that achieves comparable ultra-narrow linewidth, low frequency phase noise and the low power consumption in a compact package approximately one half the size of our standard Micro-ITLA. 
Further extending our world leadership in lasers for the highest speed and highest capacity communications links, we also provide ultra-pure light tunable lasers with wider tuning ranges which support more channels or higher speeds. For high baud rate, high capacity per wavelength systems, the Micro Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable lasers are available in a C++ LASERTM configuration, which has a tuning range of 6 THz, covering the full “Super C-band.” This is 50 percent more spectrum than a standard 80 channel, 50 GHz spaced laser. The C++ LASERTM ITLA can tune over 120 channels with 50 GHz per channel spacing or 80 channels with 75 GHz per channel spacing. This fully captures the increase in fiber capacity generated by these newer modulation approaches when combined with our C++ ICRTM Receivers and C++ CDMTM Modulators.
High Performance Laser Products: For applications inside data centers and in connecting antennas for 5G wireless networks, we design and manufacture electro-absorptively modulated lasers (EML) and high power distributed feedback lasers (DFB) as well as driver ICs for these lasers.
We manufacture and sell 100G products for data center applications, including 28 Gbaud and 53 Gbaud EMLs, laser drivers, modulator drivers and photodiode receivers used for single wavelength PAM4 100G applications and four wavelength 400G intra-data center transmission.
For hyperscale data center applications, we have introduced high power laser diode array products for short reach Silicon Photonics based 100G intra-data center interconnections which use parallel single-mode architectures, or PSM4, as well as coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM architectures. 
Our High Speed Coherent Component Products
High Speed Products: We produce high speed and high performance transmitter and receiver products for 400G and beyond optical transmission applications over distances of up to 2,000 kilometers. These products include our integrated coherent receiver (ICR) and coherent driver modulator (CDM), which also support baud rates of up to 96 Gbaud and can operate over the C++ wavelength band covering 6 Terahertz. Furthermore, we are developing technology that can support baud rates of up to 128 Gbaud and transmission of more than 1 terabit per second (Tbps). We have integrated transmitter and receiver functions into a single integrated COSA, which has an ultra-small form factor designed to fit into the next generation pluggable transceiver form factors such as QSFP-DD and OSFP. Our technologies support encoding 400, 600 and 800 Gigabits to more than 1 Terabit per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver, as well as enabling smaller, more compact and more highly integrated designs for the individual elements and integrated COSAs.
Our High Performance Wavelength Management Products
We are an industry leading supplier of low-loss, high-capacity wavelength management products that are used in rapidly expanding ROADM nodes for high speed telecom carrier networks, in open line systems for new 400ZR architectures and in 5G wireless backhaul applications. These products utilize our PIC integration technologies to expand and extend the transport of optical signals, lowering total network cost and power consumption. We believe we are one of the highest volume manufacturers of PICs in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.
Multi-Cast Switches: Our Multi-Cast Switches (MCS) are used in ROADM nodes to allocate bandwidth dynamically and efficiently, adjusting for fast changing traffic patterns and provisioning and supporting software defined optical networks. We provide Multi-Cast switching solutions for 100G and above coherent systems. Our 4x16, 8x16 and 12x16 Multi-Cast switch modules for colorless, directionless and contentionless, or CDC, ROADMs efficiently allocate bandwidth and route signals in 100G and higher data rate coherent networks to provide scalable contentionless operation and achieve the highest traffic management efficiency, optimizing traffic flows in coherent transmission systems. Our MCSs use our planar lightwave circuit photonic integration platform and consists of a complex array of switches, waveguides, taps, crossings and other functional elements. 
Arrayed Waveguide Gratings: We design and manufacture arrayed wavelength gratings (AWGs), multiplexers and filters used in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) open and proprietary line systems. We design and manufacture wavelength management products that are customized for the highest speed and highest capacity coherent systems operating at 400G, 600G, 800G or higher data rates. We have introduced new AWGs for advanced coherent systems that offer channel spacing from 75 GHz to 150 GHz and channel counts from 40 to 85 channels, covering the widest spectral bands used today and supporting data rates that will extend to 1 THz and beyond.

Our Customers
In the fourth quarter of 2020 we had four 10% or more revenue customers, comprising 22%, 19%, 16% and 10% of revenue, or a total of 67% of total revenue. For the full year 2020, we had three 10% or more revenue customers, comprising Huawei at 40%, Ciena Corporation at 17% and Acacia Communications at 10%. Excluding Huawei revenues for the year 2020, we have three 10% or more revenue customers comprising Ciena at 29%, Acacia Communications at 17% and Nokia at 11% of our revenue. In 2019, customers of 10% or more revenue were Huawei and Ciena, which accounted for 41% and 29% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2018, Huawei and Ciena accounted for 46% and 24% of our total revenue, respectively.
The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") added Huawei and certain affiliates to the BIS Entity List (“Entity List”) with an effective date of May 21, 2019. On August 17, 2020, BIS in the Department of Commerce increased restrictions on Huawei and its affiliates on the Entity List related to items produced domestically and abroad that use U.S. technology or software and imposed additional requirements for items subject to Commerce export control. On October 5, 2020, we announced that we will manage our business without relying on revenue contributions from Huawei. As Huawei has been our largest customer in recent periods, this action had a material impact on our revenue in 2020 and is expected to continue to have a material impact on our revenue going forward.
Our Sales and Marketing
Our sales model aligns with customers through coordination of our sales, product application engineering and manufacturing teams. Our sales cycles typically require significant time and expenditure of resources to realize revenue from the sale of products. The length of our sales cycle is typically 6 to 12 months for an existing product and 12 to 18 months or longer for a new product.
We use a global direct sales force based in North America, Europe and Asia, including China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. We have very deep technical relationships with our customers' design teams. We believe that these collaborative engineering activities provide us insight into our customers’ broader and longer-term needs and are an important part of our value delivery to our customers.
Our marketing team focuses on product strategy, product development, roadmap development, new product introduction processes, program management, product demand stimulation and assessment, and competitive analysis. Our marketing team also seeks to educate the market about our products by communicating our value proposition and product differentiation in direct customer interactions and presentations, at industry tradeshows, at technical conferences, through digital and online content such as webinars and blogs, and in industry forums such as MSA (multi supplier agreement) committees.
Our Research and Development
Our research and development activities continue to advance the performance leadership boundaries in high speed lasers and digital optics, silicon photonics and hybrid photonic integration, optoelectronics control and in signal processing.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital into our research and development operations. Research and development expenses were $56.1 million, $57.6 million and $53.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing.
Human Capital Resources 
We are committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent. Investing, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,200 full-time employees, of which approximately 19% are in the Americas, 10% in Japan and 71% in China. As a global manufacturer of products for DCI and 
telecom networks, a large number of our employees are engineers or trained technical workers focusing on advanced manufacturing, and many of them hold masters', doctorate, or equivalent or higher degrees. 
We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development, and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any employee-generated work stoppages or disruptions, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Our U.S. and Canadian employees are not represented by a labor union. Under Chinese law, all employees in our China subsidiaries are members of a union that is overseen by the Chinese government. The majority of the employees in our Japanese subsidiary are also members of a union. 
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to being broadly inclusive to capture the ideas and perspectives that fuel innovation and enable our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts with our diverse world-wide employee base which represents well over 25 countries. We are also committed to gender diversity in our workforce with women currently holding 33% of executive leadership positions at our company and representing 36% of our employees. We strive to remain a diverse company as we believe it is integral to our success.
Our Suppliers
We build long term relationships with companies that are capable to meet our stringent technical requirements at the same time as being cost competitive, and who can scale with us over time. As a result, we work closely with our suppliers to understand their business as we grow together. We use suppliers from the U.S., China, Japan and other locations.
Although there are multiple sources for most of the component parts of our products, some components are sourced from single or, in some cases, limited sources, which can increase risks of materials availability for production. We also use contract manufacturers primarily in Thailand and other Asia locations for the back-end manufacturing of certain of our products. 
We also work to develop new companies as suppliers for new technologies, innovations and for purposes of managing costs and technology competitiveness over time. We examine our supply chain for their performance, quality, technology and technology roadmaps, service, engineering talent, labor practices and environmental sustainability.
We promote long-term relationships with suppliers that we believe have the elements for long-term success, and that have management teams that exercise good practices for both their long-term success and our long-term success and competitiveness.
Our Customer Relationships and Support for Supply Chains
Our sales process requires design and development in collaboration with customers and working with them through their introduction of new, advanced communications systems, whether for Cloud infrastructure customers or for telecom equipment manufacturers. As a supply philosophy we maintain long-term relationships with customers and our business grows with them over time. Our maintaining close technical collaboration and commercial working relationships with customers requires that we have a technically capable and commercially adept global sales and engineering team facing our customers that can support the totality of their supply chains.
Our direct sales force works with our customers in an integrated approach to understand current and future needs. Because we operate a sales model that focuses on alignment with our customers, we additionally must operate our manufacturing and product delivery functions to accommodate flexible demand.
Sales of our products generally are made pursuant to purchase orders, often with short lead times. Purchase orders are typically made without deposits and quantities actually purchased by our customers are frequently revised to reflect changes in our customers’ needs. In 2020, sales by purchase orders comprised more than 90% of our revenue.
Certain of our customers use vendor managed inventory ("VMI") arrangements under which we manufacture at a customer’s request, then ship to its facility or a designated contract manufacturer for the customer, to be held until it is used by the customer. We maintain title to VMI until the customer uses the inventory. At that time the customer takes title to the products, it reports the consumption to us and we recognize the revenue for the product sale. In 2020, sales by customer VMI arrangements comprised approximately 10% of our revenue.
For larger network equipment companies and for Cloud hyperscalers, additional needs for maintaining inventory arises from their need for supply flexibility in the face of longer lead times for some supply chain components including chip-level components produced in wafer fabs. We anticipate that as our revenue increases from hyperscalers, our proportion of finished goods inventory to sales for those companies will increase, as will our need for maintaining more raw material inventory as a percent of total inventory.
The business cycle, as well as international trade discussion between countries including the U.S. and China, require that we carefully monitor and adjust production levels in line with end user demand to minimize impacts of inventory overstocking. 
Our Competitors
The market for optical communications systems is highly competitive. We specialize in products that provide the highest speed over distance for which there are fewer competitors than in the broader market. While no single company competes with us across all of our product areas, our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. We believe the principal competitive requirements to be successful in this market are:
•ability to provide leading edge technologies for high speed and highest speed over distance communications, including ultra-pure light tunable lasers; 
•ability to integrate complex and highly precise chip-based and component product designs into sub-system level solutions;
•ability to produce these complex chip-level products and module products solutions that require precise and high quality manufacturing processes and controls, and;
•ability to consistently produce and deliver the complex products in high volume with high reliability and high quality to customers globally.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We believe our principal competitors include:
•In lasers and coherent products Acacia Communications, Inc., Furukawa Co., Ltd., Fujitsu Optical Components Limited, NTT Electronics Corporation, II-VI Incorporated, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. and others; 
•In wavelength management and switching Accelink Technologies Co., Ltd., II-VI, Lumentum Holding Inc., Molex Incorporated and NTT Electronics.
We also face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their manufacturing products internally. These customers may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge as a result of their higher levels of integration. 
Our Financial Information by Geographic Region
Our geographic sales represent locations of our customers or their respective contract manufacturers rather than the location of final use or deployment. Major contract manufacturer locations include Mexico, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. These are our “ship to” destinations. We have historically reported quarterly revenue by geographic territory, i.e. Americas, China, and Rest of World. 
We serve virtually all leading network equipment manufacturers globally. Seven of these customers comprise more than 80% of our revenue.
For information regarding our revenue and property, plant and equipment by geographic region, see Note 3 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
