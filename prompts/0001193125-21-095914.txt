 General 
 Our business operations are conducted through Chesapeake Bank of Maryland (the Bank), a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in Baltimore County, Maryland. The Bank was founded in 1913 as New Eastern Avenue Permanent Savings and Loan Association. 
 CBM Bancorp, Inc. (CBM Bancorp or the Company) was incorporated on May 22, 2018 to serve as the successor holding company for the Bank. CBM Bancorps principal activity is the ownership of the Banks capital stock and the management of the offering proceeds it retained in connection with the Banks conversion. CBM Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. 
 The Bank operates as a community-oriented institution by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and serving other financial needs of its local community. The Bank conducts business out of its main office located in Baltimore County, Maryland, and out of three branch offices located in Arbutus, Maryland, Bel Air, Maryland and Pasadena, Maryland. The Banks business strategy consists principally of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area, described below, and using those funds, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, to originate loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate. Nonresidential real estate loans, construction and land development loans and commercial loans constitute a significant percentage of the loan portfolio and, in that respect, the Banks lending operations are more diversified and have more risk than many traditional thrift institutions. 
 The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC). The Bank is subject to Maryland banking laws except to the extent they are preempted by Federal law. The Bank is not regulated by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 37 full-time employees and five part-time employees, none of whom was a party to a collective bargaining agreement. The Bank is led by an experienced core management team that encourages team members to share their talents in the communities we serve through outreach and volunteer activities. 
 We strive to recruit top talent and provide professional development opportunities to all team members. We seek to improve retention, development, and job satisfaction of team members by providing career skills training and a safe work environment while recognizing the unique contribution of each team member. We offer a comprehensive benefits program to our employees designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members. 
 We are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members and our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous health and safety challenges. We enacted a proactive response to the pandemic by limiting in-branch lobby traffic while encouraging team members to work remotely where possible. In addition, we provided access to recent safety standards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other local and federal agencies and implemented various health and safety protocols.

 Available Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 2001 East Joppa Road, Baltimore, Maryland 21234, and our telephone number is (410) 665-7600. Our website address is www.chesapeakebank.com. Information on our website should not be considered part of this Annual Report. 
 Market Area 
 The Bank currently serves the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area through four banking offices, with two locations in Baltimore County, one location in Anne Arundel County and one location in Harford County. The branches are located to the north and south of the city of Baltimore, with the largest marketing presence on the northern side of Baltimore County, where the main office is maintained. The immediate areas surrounding the four office locations can be categorized as suburban areas of the Baltimore metropolitan area. 
 The Bank defines its primary market area as the Baltimore MSA, which includes suburban and urban areas. The regional economy has evolved as employment in the manufacturing/industrialization sector has declined and the Banks market area economy has become broadly similar to the national economy in terms of its employment in key sectors, including services employment. The Banks market area economy is comprised of a large workforce employed in a number of employment sectors including business and professional services, healthcare, wholesale/retail trade, government, and finance/insurance/real estate. Some of the major employers in the market area include Johns Hopkins University and Hospital and Health System, and the University of Maryland Education and Health Care Systems, along with government facilities such as Fort George G. Meade, the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the United States Naval Academy. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including national, regional and other locally operated commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. In many cases, these competitors seek to provide some or all of the same community-oriented services as the Bank. Recently, financial technology companies have begun to foster additional competition. 
 Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services, private banking, insurance services and asset management. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
 Lending Activities 
 General. Our principal lending activity is originating one-to four-family residential real estate loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit. We also originate nonresidential real estate loans including multifamily loans, construction and land development loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans and consumer loans. We currently sell in the secondary market a portion of the fixed-rate conforming one-to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining jumbo loans and adjustable-rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans, in order to manage the duration and time to repricing for our loan portfolio. Subject to market conditions we intend to increase our emphasis on nonresidential real estate lending in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the yield earned on our loans.

 One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate. Our one- to four-family residential real estate portfolio consists of residential mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. A portion of our one- to four-family residential real estate lending activity consists of the origination of first mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family non-owner occupied residential properties. Our one- to four-family residential real estate portfolio also includes construction loans to individuals that convert to a permanent mortgage at the end of the construction phase. At December 31, 2020, we had $62.1 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 41.26% of our total loan portfolio, of which $10.1 million, or 16.43%, were secured by one- to four-family non-owner occupied residential real estate. Of the $62.1 million in loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, $4.0 million, or 6.44%, were construction permanent loans. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had $6.1 million of one- to four-family residential mortgages held for sale. We primarily originate fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, but depending on market conditions and borrower preferences, we also offer adjustable-rate loans. At December 31, 2020, 95.36% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 4.64% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. 
 
7 


 Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to FNMA (Federal National Mortgage Association) or FHLMC (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate both fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits, which as of December 31, 2020 was generally $520,950 for single-family homes in our market area. We typically sell a portion of our fixed-rate conforming loans on a servicing-released basis. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as jumbo loans, that we retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 10 to 30 years terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%. We also offer FHA and VA loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA and VA guidelines. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 97%. 
 Our adjustable-rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of three, five or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a Treasury index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased over the life of the loan is generally 5% over the initial interest rate of the loan. We typically hold in the portfolio our adjustable-rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Construction permanent loans are made on the same general terms as our one-to four-family residential real estate loans, but provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually up to twelve months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent appraiser. We also review and inspect each project prior to disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection of the project based on percentage of completion. 
 We offer on a limited basis one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties. Generally, we require personal guarantees from the borrowers on these properties, and we generally do not make loans in excess of 75% loan to value on non-owner occupied properties. 
 We generally do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties. We do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. Additionally, we do not offer subprime loans (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgements, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation). 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, both of which are secured by either first mortgages or second mortgages on one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2020, outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $6.9 million, or 4.58% of total loans outstanding. 
 The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and lines of credit include a title review, the recordation of a lien, a determination of the applicants ability to satisfy existing debt obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value ratios for our home equity loans and our home equity lines of credit are generally limited to 75% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and terms up to 20 years. At December 31, 2020, home equity loans totaled $1.6 million. Our home equity lines of credit generally have 20-year terms and adjustable rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to the prime rate. At December 31, 2020, home equity lines of credit totaled $5.3 million. 
 Construction and Land Development. We originate construction loans to local developers and contractors to finance the construction of one- to four-family residential properties, and nonresidential real estate and multi-family properties. We also make a limited amount of land loans to complement our construction lending activities, as such loans are generally secured by lots that will be used for residential construction for the purchase of developed lots and the construction of single-family residences. Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment purposes. At December 31, 2020, our construction and land development loans total $10.8 million, representing 7.18% of our total loan portfolio, and included $4.1 million of land loans.

 Most of our construction loans are interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage or the loan may be payable in full. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio for one- to four-family residential construction of 80% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project and with a maximum loan-to-value ratio for nonresidential and multifamily construction of 75% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project Loans for raw land generally have a maximum loan-to-value of 65% and loans for land development or improved lots have a maximum loan-to-value of 75%. Before making a commitment to fund a construction and land development loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. Construction loans also expose us to the risks that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs and that repayment will depend on the successful operation or sale of the properties. In addition, many of these borrowers have more than one outstanding loan, so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non-payment and loss. 
 Nonresidential Real Estate. We offer nonresidential mortgage loans secured by nonresidential real estate, such as retail and office buildings, as well as loans secured by multi-family properties. Our nonresidential real estate portfolio also includes construction loans that convert to permanent mortgages at the end of the construction phase. At December 31, 2020, we had $60.2 million in nonresidential mortgages, representing 39.99% of our total loan portfolio and included $7.9 million of multifamily loans and $1.1 million in construction permanent loans. Excluding multifamily loans and construction permanent loans, $14.2 million of our nonresidential real estate portfolio was owner-occupied real estate and $37.0 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied real estate. 
 We originate a variety of fixed and adjustable-rate nonresidential real estate loans with terms generally up to 10 years and amortization periods generally up to 25 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans are generally indexed to the prime rate, plus a margin. Construction permanent loans are made on the same general terms as nonresidential real estate loans, but provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually up to twelve months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan converts to a permanent mortgage loan. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating nonresidential real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower and the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar properties. Nonresidential owner-occupied real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. Nonresidential non-owner occupied and multifamily loans are generally originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. When circumstances warrant, guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate customers. In addition, the borrowers and guarantors financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. 
 Nonresidential real estate loans entail greater risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income for the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for nonresidential real estate than residential properties. 
 Commercial. We originate commercial term loans and lines of credit to a variety of small and medium sized businesses in our market area. These loans are generally secured by business assets, and we may support this collateral with junior liens on real property. We also originate Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans under a new loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). At December 31, 2020, commercial loans were $10.2 million, or 6.77% of our total loan portfolio. Included in the commercial loans were $4.5 million in PPP loans, or 44.12% of the commercial loan portfolio. 
 
9 


 The commercial loans we offer include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either fixed or variable rates of interest. Variable rates are based on the prime rate, plus a margin. Commercial loans typically have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than nonresidential real estate loans, but may involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 
 PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and are eligible for full or partial forgiveness. The principal amount of the borrowers PPP loan, including accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount so long as employee and compensation levels of the business entity are maintained and the loan proceeds are used for payroll and qualifying expenses. 
 Consumer. We offer a limited range of consumer loans, principally to customers residing in our primary market area with other relationships with us and with acceptable credit ratings. Our consumer loans generally consist of loans secured by deposit accounts, loans on new and used automobiles and unsecured personal loans. At December 31, 2020, consumer loans were $336,000, or 0.22% of our total loan portfolio. 
 Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations are generated by our loan personnel and from referrals from existing customers and real estate brokers. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and pricing levels established by competing banks, credit unions and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and accordingly, the volume of our loan originations can vary from period to period. 
 Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis a significant portion of our fixed-rate conforming one-to four-family residential mortgage loans that we have originated. We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. 
 From time to time, we may purchase participation interests in loans. We underwrite our participation interest in the loan that we are purchasing according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. We also have sold portions of loans that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. In addition, we sometimes purchase whole loans from third parties to supplement our loan production. These loans generally consist of loans secured by one-to four-family residential real estate. 
 The following table shows our loan originations, participations, purchases, sales and repayment activities for the periods indicated, including loans held for sale.

 Loans to One Borrower. Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of the Banks unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by readily marketable collateral.) This 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus was approximately $6.8 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 our largest credit relationship totaled $5.7 million, consisting of three nonresidential loans secured by income-producing commercial real estate. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending is subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on the loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain and property valuations, consistent with our appraisal policy. The appraisals are prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by the board of directors. To assess the borrowers ability to repay, we review the borrowers income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of nonresidential real estate loans, we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. When applicable, rent rolls, leases and contingent liabilities are received. The Board of Directors establishes and approves the members of the Loan Committee, our loan policies as well as our lending limits. The Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain senior officers up to prescribed limits not exceeding $500,000 depending on the officers experience and loan type. Generally, loans in excess of $500,000 but not greater than $750,000 require approval of both our Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Lending Officer. Loans in excess of $750,000 but not greater than $1.5 million require approval of the Management Loan Committee. Loans in excess of $1.5 million require approval of the Board Loan Committee. Any loan that involves an exception to loan policy must be authorized by the next higher level of loan authority. Exceptions to loan policy are reported to the Board of Directors quarterly. 
Delinquencies and Asset Quality 
 Delinquency Procedures. When a loan payment becomes 16 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice, and loan officers may contact their customers. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail an additional late notice and a loan-specific letter written by a collection representative, and we also place telephone calls to the borrower. These loan collection efforts continue until a loan becomes 90 days past due, at which point we would refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings unless management determines that it is in the best interest of the Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the board of directors each month. 
 Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. 
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Prior to acquisition, we generally order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expenses of the current period. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less estimated selling costs. After acquisition, all costs incurred to maintain the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.

 Interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 had non-accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $9,000 and $18,000, respectively. We recognized $6,000 and $15,000 of interest income for these loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2020, there were no loans not disclosed in the above table, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. 
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose the insured institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve close attention, are required to be designated as special mention. 
 
13 


 When assets are classified as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish a portion of the related general loss allowances to such assets as it deems prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required to either establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institutions determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets, which includes foreclosed real estate, at the dates indicated were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in managements judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on managements evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loans losses which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, managements ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss or loan pools, the fair value of the underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. An as integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. 
 The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning for the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. 
 We continue to monitor and modify our allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. No assurances can be given that the level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on the loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses.

 At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses represented 1.15% of total loans and 918.62% of nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan losses increased to $1.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $1.4 million at December 31, 2019. Due to uncertainty of economic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company increased the qualitative factors in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses and due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impact, the Company will continue to monitor and additional adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary. There were $2,000 in net loan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $16,000 in net loan recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2019. The difference in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributed to a charge-off during December 31, 2019 of $90,000 on a one-to four-family residential loan for which we have no additional exposure offset by a recovery during December 31, 2019 in the amount of $115,000. 
 Investment Activities 
 General. Our investment policy is established and reviewed annually by the board of directors. We are permitted under federal law to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Government obligations, securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities, time deposits of federally insured institutions, certain bankers acceptances and federal funds. 
 Our investment objectives are to maintain high asset quality, to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. The board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. The board of directors is also responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring investment performance. The board of directors reviews the status of the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if warranted. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. We do not maintain a trading portfolio. Establishing a trading portfolio would require specific authorization by the board of directors. 
 Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our available for sale and held to maturity securities at the dates indicated.

 At December 31, 2020, all of our securities were classified as available for sale, which is carried at fair value, totaling $16.5 million, or 7.03% of total assets. We also held $46.8 million in interest-bearing deposits at other banks, $6.5 million in time deposits in other banks and $411,000 of stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta at December 31, 2020. 
 United States Government and Federal Agency Obligations. While United States Government and Federal Agency obligations generally provide lower yields than other investments in the securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and as an interest rate risk hedge in the event of significant mortgage loan prepayments.
 At December 31, 2020, U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations consisted of fixed-rate Treasury securities, and fixed-rate Federal Home Loan Bank, Farm Credit Bank and Fannie Mae securities. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our United States Government and Federal Agency obligations totaled $2.6 million. 
 Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in residential mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. We have not purchased privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in residential mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. 
 Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our residential mortgage-backed securities totaled $14.0 million. 
 Municipal Securities. We had invested in municipal securities which have a higher yield than U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations in order to improve the yield of the securities portfolio. Municipal securities generally involve more credit risk than U.S. Government and Federal Agency securities which have the explicit or implicit backing of the federal government. The market for municipal securities is also more limited than that for U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations.    Under our investment policy, municipal securities must be rated AA by at least one nationally recognized rating agency in order to be considered for investment. We sold our holdings in municipal securities during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2020, are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment date, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits traditionally have been the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. In addition to deposits, we derive funds primarily from principal and interest payments on loans. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions and competition. Borrowings may also be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources and may be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. 
 Deposits. We generate deposits primarily from within our market area through our branches. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. 
 
18 


 Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and premature withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of the Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. The following table sets forth the average balance and weighted average rate of our deposit products for the periods indicated.

 Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta upon the security of the common stock we own in that bank and certain of our residential mortgage loans, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased lending. 
 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were permitted to borrow up to an aggregate total of $58.7 million and $55.1 million, respectively, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. There were $5.0 million and $2.5 million in borrowings outstanding with the Federal Home Loan Bank at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, we had credit availability of $2,000,000 with a correspondent bank for short-term liquidity needs, if necessary. There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 under this facility. 
 The following table shows certain information regarding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at or for the dates indicated:

 Subsidiaries 
 CBM Bancorp has no subsidiaries other than Chesapeake Bank of Maryland. 
 Personnel 
 At December 31, 2020, the Bank had 37 full-time employees and five part-time employees, none of whom was a party to a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Expense and Tax Allocation 
 The Bank entered into an agreement with CBM Bancorp to provide it with certain administrative support services for compensation not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, the Bank and CBM Bancorp entered into an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability. 
TAXATION 
 CBM Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to CBM Bancorp or Chesapeake Bank of Maryland. 
 Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 Federal Taxation 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, CBM Bancorp and the Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing their federal income tax returns. CBM Bancorp and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. 
 Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, the Bank is permitted to use the reserve method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $1.5 million of reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. At December 31, 2019, our total federal pre-1988 base year reserve was approximately $1.5 million. However, under current law, pre-1988 base year reserves remain subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. 
 Alternative Minimum Tax. For tax years beginning before December 31, 2017, the Internal Revenue Code imposed an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the alternative minimum tax applicable to corporations is repealed. In addition, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending before January 1, 2022, any alternative minimum tax credits are refundable in an amount equal to 50% (100% for tax years beginning in 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credits for the tax year, over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Certain alternative minimum tax payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2020, CBM Bancorp had no alternative minimum tax payments available to carry forward to future periods. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards. As a result of the Act generally, a company may carry net operating losses forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2020, CBM Bancorp had no federal net operating loss carryforwards. 
 
21 


 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. CBM Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% in the case of dividends received from a corporation in which a corporate recipient owns at least 20% of its stock, and corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 
State Taxation 
 The State of Maryland imposes an income tax of 8.25% on income measured in substantially the same manner as federally taxable income. CBM Bancorp, as a Maryland business corporation, as well as the Bank are required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the State of Maryland. Affiliated corporations that file a consolidated federal income tax return must file separate income tax returns for the State of Maryland. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards. As a result of the Act generally, a company may carry net operating losses forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank had no net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes. 
 
22 


 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 As a federal savings association, the Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the OCC and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of security holders. The Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as the Bank or CBM Bancorp, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 In addition, the Bank must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants for violations of laws and regulations and for engaging in unsafe and unsound practices. Formal enforcement actions include the issuance of capital directive or cease and desist order, civil money penalties, removal of officers and/or directors, and receivership or conservatorship of the institution. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, CBM Bancorp is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve. CBM Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the federal securities laws. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the OCC, FDIC, the Federal Reserve or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of CBM Bancorp and the Bank. 
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to the Bank and CBM Bancorp. This description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and CBM Bancorp. 
 The CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CARES Act) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide national emergency economic relief measures. Many of the CARES Acts programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions, such as the Bank, and have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over CBM Bancorp and the Bank. Furthermore, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation, lifecycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. In addition, it is possible that Congress will enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act and other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Paycheck Protection Program. Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. It is anticipated that additional revisions to the SBAs interim final rules on forgiveness and loan review procedures will be forthcoming to address these and related changes. In December 2020, Congress amended the CARES Act through the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CAA) to add an additional $900 billion of stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic. Among other things, the CAA renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and permitting the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. As a participating lender in the PPP, the Bank continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto. 
 Guidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19.
 On March 22, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (the Interagency Statement), which encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act provided that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the President of the United States terminates. The CAA extended this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or the first day of a banks fiscal year that begins after the national emergency ends. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators views on consumer protection considerations. In accordance with such guidance, the Bank is offering short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Banks COVID-19 loan modifications pursuant to the CARES Act. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 Examinations and Assessments. The Bank is primarily supervised by the OCC. The Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The Bank is required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agencys operations. 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio, and a Tier 1 capital to total average assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements took effect January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). 
 The capital standards require banking organizations to maintain ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is composed of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of 
 
24 


  accumulated other comprehensive income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that did not exercise the accumulated other comprehensive income opt-out have accumulated other comprehensive income incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively increases the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 capital and 10.5% for Total capital. 
 Under applicable federal statute, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the implementing regulations, in order to be considered well-capitalized, a bank must have a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%, and a leverage ratio of 5%. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, a bank must have the minimum capital ratios required by the regulatory capital rule described above. Institutions with lower capital ratios are assigned to lower capital categories. Based on safety and soundness concerns, a bank may be assigned to a lower capital category than would otherwise apply based on its capital ratios. A bank that is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. A bank that is not at least adequately capitalized is subject to numerous additional restrictions, and a guaranty by its holding company is required. A bank with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2.0% or less is subject to the appointment of the FDIC as receiver if its capital level does not improve within 90 days. 
 At December 31, 2020, the Banks capital exceeded all applicable requirements and the Bank met the criteria for being considered well-capitalized. 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA), enacted in May 2018, introduced an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average consolidated assets (CBLR) of between 8% and 10%. Under the statute, any qualifying depository institution or holding company that maintains a leverage ratio exceeding the CBLR will be considered to satisfy the generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements. 
 Under the final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies under the EGRRCPA, a community banking organization may opt into the CBLR framework if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 9%, less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework will not be required to report or calculate compliance with risk-based capital requirements and will also be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action regulations. 
 The final CBLR rule took effect on January 1, 2020, and banking organizations that wished to opt into the CBLR framework were able to do so through their Call Reports for the quarter ending March 31, 2020. We elected not to use the CBLR framework. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower. The Bank is subject to a statutory lending limit on aggregate loans to one borrower or a related group of borrowers. That limit is equal to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, except that for loans fully secured by specified readily marketable collateral, the limit is increased to 25%. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
25 


 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, the Bank is required to meet a qualified thrift lender (QTL) test to avoid certain restrictions on its operations. Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine out of every twelve months on a rolling basis. Portfolio assets generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings associations business. Alternatively, the Bank may also satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 
 A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners Loan Act. At December 31, 2020, the Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
 Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. Federal regulations impose restrictions on capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings associations capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if (i) the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings associations net income for that year to date plus the savings associations retained net income for the preceding two years; (ii) the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; (iii) the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, supervisory agreement or regulatory condition; or (iv) the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings under application processing rules of the OCC. Even if an application is not otherwise required, a savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 
 A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: (i) the savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. 
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. Finally, the Bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversion of Banks of the Chesapeake, M.H.C. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings associations authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. CBM Bancorp is an affiliate of the Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Finally, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. 
 The Bank is also subject to certain statutory and regulatory restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders and their related interests. These provisions generally require extensions of credit to insiders: 
 

 | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Banks capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26 


 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Banks board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits under applicable regulation. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC insures deposits at federally insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Assessments for most institutions are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for most banks and savings associations is 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the savings associations record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings associations failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The Community Reinvestment Act requires all insured depository institutions to publicly disclose their rating. The Bank received a outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customers non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. The Bank has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
 Other Consumer Protection Regulations. In connection with its deposit taking and lending activities, the Bank is subject to numerous federal and state laws designed to protect customers. The deposit operations of the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our loan operations are subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, including the: 

 | Truth in Lending Act, requiring financial institutions to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring lenders to provide borrowers with information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibiting certain lending practices with respect to real estate transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27 


 Bank Secrecy Act / USA PATRIOT ACT. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institutions anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. 
 Prohibitions against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Bank is required to hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at December 31, 2020. 
Holding Company Regulation 
 General. As a savings and loan holding company, CBM Bancorp is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over CBM Bancorp and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the Bank. 
 Permissible Activities. CBM Bancorps business activities are limited to the activities authorized by statute and regulation for savings and loan holding companies, the activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, and, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, the activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
 Acquisitions. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
 Capital. The federal regulatory capital rules apply to all depository institutions as well as to all depository institution holding companies with consolidated assets of $3 billion or more. The regulatory capital requirements generally do not apply on a consolidated basis to a bank or savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion unless the holding company: (i) is engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) conducts significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; or (iii) has a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. The Federal Reserve may apply the regulatory capital standards at its discretion to any depository institution holding company, regardless of asset size, if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes. Because CBM Bancorp has total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion and does not engage in activities that would trigger application of the federal regulatory capital rules, it is not at present subject to consolidated capital requirements under such rules. 
 Source of Strength. Under the Home Owners Loan Act, a savings and loan holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary institutions and to commit resources to support each subsidiary institution. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a savings and holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary institution. The Federal Reserve may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary institution or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize its ability to commit resources to such subsidiary. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it. 
 
28 


 Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the companys net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the companys overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the companys capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of CBM Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
Federal Securities Laws 
 CBM Bancorp common stock is registered with the SEC. CBM Bancorp is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 CBM Bancorp is an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. 
 An emerging growth company may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as say-on-pay votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as say-on-golden parachute votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, CBM Bancorp will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. CBM Bancorp has elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
