Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 We are a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. On November 20, 2020, the Company entered into business combination agreements for its initial Business Combination. Upon consummation of the business combinations with UpHealth Holdings, Inc. and Cloudbreak Health, LLC, we expect to change our name and be known as UpHealth, Inc. (New UpHealth). 
 We seek to capitalize on the significant experience and contacts of our management team to complete our initial business combination. We believe our management teams distinctive background and record of acquisition and operational success could have a transformative impact on verified target businesses. Although we may pursue our initial business combination in any business, industry or geographic location, we currently intend to focus on opportunities to capitalize on the ability of our management team, particularly our executive officers, to identify, acquire and operate a business in the Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) industries. Specifically, we intend to target TMT companies that are at the forefront of high technology and are enabling the future evolution of intelligent systems and solutions (such as data-intense mobility, autonomous platforms, smart sensor applications, human interaction, unified data management and artificial intelligence). We intend to evaluate both private and public companies as potential initial business combination targets, focusing on opportunities that we believe would provide appropriate risk adjusted returns to stockholders. Following our initial business combination, our objective will be to implement or support the acquired companys operating strategies in order to generate additional value for stockholders. General goals may include additional acquisitions and operational improvements. 
 Our management team has significant hands-on experience helping TMT companies optimize their existing and new growth initiatives by exploiting insights from rich data assets that already exist within most TMT companies. We intend to apply a unique Mentor-Investor philosophy to partner with our targets where we will offer financial, operational and executive mentoring in order to accelerate their growth and development from a privately held entity to a publicly traded company. Further, we intend to share best practices and key learnings, gathered from our management teams operating and investing experience, as well as strong relationships in the TMT industry to help shape corporate strategies. Additionally, our management team has operated and invested in leading global TMT companies across their corporate life cycles, and has developed deep relationships with key large multi-national organizations and investors. We believe that these relationships and our management teams know-how present a significant opportunity to help drive strategic dialogue, access new customer relationships and achieve global ambitions following the completion of our initial business combination. We believe that we are providing an interesting alternative investment opportunity that capitalizes on key trends impacting the capital markets for TMT companies. 
 We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive businesses within the TMT industry that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. Our objective is to consummate our initial business combination with such a business and enhance stockholder value by improving its operational performance. We believe we can achieve this objective by utilizing our management teams extensive experience in both TMT industry transactions and operating TMT companies in combination with our management teams network of contacts in the TMT industry. We believe many companies in the TMT industry could benefit from access to the public markets but have been unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the time it takes to conduct a traditional initial public offering (IPO), market volatility and pricing uncertainty. We intend to focus on evaluating more established companies with leading competitive positions, strong management teams and strong long-term potential for revenue growth and margin expansion.

Business Combination 
 As set forth below and the Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC) dated November 23, 2020, on November 23, 2020, the Company executed a business combination agreement, dated as of November 20, 2020, with Uphealth Holdings, Inc. (UpHealth), and UpHealth Merger Sub, Inc., (UpHealth Merger Sub) (such business combination agreement, the UpHealth BCA), and such business combination, the UpHealth Combination). In addition, on November 23, 2020, the Company executed a business combination agreement, dated as of November 20, 2020, with Cloudbreak Health, LLC (Cloudbreak), Cloudbreak Merger Sub, LLC (Cloudbreak Merger Sub), Chirinjeev Kathuria and Mariya Pylypiv (collectively, the UpHealth Significant Stockholders) and UpHealth, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the Cloudbreak members (such business combination agreement, the Cloudbreak BCA, and such business combination, the Cloudbreak Combination). Consistent with our strategy, we have identified and used general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating the targets businesses, and we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent managements and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial and other information for each entity in the UpHealth Combination and Cloudbreak Combination, collectively referred as the Business Combinations in this Annual Report. 
 The UpHealth BCA 
 Pursuant to the terms of the UpHealth BCA, GigCapital2 will acquire UpHealth through the statutory merger of UpHealth Merger Sub with and into UpHealth, with UpHealth surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital2 (the UpHealth Merger). At the effective time of the UpHealth Merger, each share of UpHealth common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of GigCapital2 (the GigCapital2 Common Stock) equal to the Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio will be equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration divided by the sum of the aggregate number of shares of UpHealth common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the UpHealth Merger. The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall not exceed 99,000,000 shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock, subject to certain adjustments, less the Thrasys Incentive Amount (as defined below). UpHealth and Innovations Group, Inc., a Utah corporation (Innovations Group) previously entered into a merger agreement for UpHealth to acquire Innovations Group. UpHealth also has previously entered into a share purchase agreement providing for the purchase of 99% or more of the equity interests of Glocal Healthcare Systems Private Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of India (Glocal), and UpHealth as of the date of entry into the UpHealth BCA owns approximately 43% of the equity interests of Glocal. The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced by approximately (a) 14,142,857 shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock, if upon the UpHealth Closing (as defined below), UpHealth has not completed its acquisition of Innovations Group, and (b) 99,000 shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock for each 1.0% interest of Glocal that is below 90% and that is not yet acquired by UpHealth upon the UpHealth Closing. Adjustments to the Aggregate Merger Consideration will further be made to the extent that the indebtedness at the UpHealth Closing of UpHealth and the Company Subsidiaries less the cash and cash equivalents of UpHealth and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately before such time is greater than $33,850,000 (excluding any Acquisition Promissory Notes). The Acquisition Promissory Notes are promissory notes previously issued by UpHealth for its acquisitions of Thrasys, Inc., a California corporation (Thrasys), Behavioral Health Services, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company (Behavioral Health Services), TTC Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (TTC Healthcare) and the interests in Glocal, or to be issued by UpHealth for its acquisitions of Innovations Group and TTC Healthcare, with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $86,200,000, of which $35,500,000 is due and payable at the UpHealth Closing; provided, that such amount shall be reduced by $30,000,000, if upon the UpHealth Closing, UpHealth has not completed its acquisition of Innovations Group.

Two individuals who are officers of UpHealth, and were shareholders of Thrasys prior to its merger with UpHealth, will following the UpHealth Closing, if he or she is a service provider to GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of grant, be awarded restricted stock units of GigCapital2 (the Thrasys Incentive Amount). The Thrasys Incentive Amount that shall be eligible to be granted shall be (a) 32.016% multiplied by (b) 15.136% multiplied by (c) the Adjusted Aggregate Merger/Incentive Amount. The Adjusted Aggregate Merger/Incentive Amount shall be (a) $990,000,000, subject to certain adjustments, divided by (b) $10.00. In the event that either individual ceases to be a service provider to GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of grant, the portion of the Thrasys Incentive Amount allocated to such individual will not be reallocated to the other individual. Such restricted stock units shall vest into shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock at the earlier of (i) the date that is one year after the UpHealth Closing, (ii) the date on which the last sale price of GigCapital2 Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 90 days after the UpHealth Closing, or (iii) the date on which GigCapital2 completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the GigCaptial2s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock for cash, securities or other property. If either of these individuals ceases to be a service provider to GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to any vesting date, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units shall be cancelled and surrendered to GigCapital2. 
 The Cloudbreak BCA 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Cloudbreak BCA, GigCapital2 will acquire Cloudbreak through the statutory merger of Cloudbreak Merger Sub with and into Cloudbreak, with Cloudbreak surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital2 (the Cloudbreak Merger). At the effective time of the Cloudbreak Merger (the Cloudbreak Effective Time): (i) each Common Unit (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) (and the membership interests represented thereby) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Cloudbreak Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock equal to the Common Unit Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) (together with any Business Combination Share Adjustment (defined below) to which each Common Unit is entitled, the Common Unit Merger Consideration); (ii) each Series A Preferred Unit (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) (and the membership interests represented thereby) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Cloudbreak Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock equal to the Preferred Unit Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) (in addition to any Business Combination Share Adjustment to which each Series A Preferred Unit is entitled); and (iii) each Option (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Cloudbreak Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by GigCapital2 and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock in an amount set forth on the allocation schedule, which amount shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of Common Units subject to such Option, multiplied by (ii) the Common Unit Exchange Ratio (each such converted option, an Exchanged Option). Each holder of Exchanged Options shall also be entitled to any Business Combination Share Adjustment made pursuant to the Cloudbreak BCA. Additionally, immediately prior to the Cloudbreak Effective Time, each Common Warrant (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) shall convert into Common Units in accordance with their terms. The aggregate number of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock issuable at the closing of the Cloudbreak Merger, and upon the exercise of all Exchanged Options on a net exercise basis, shall equal 11,000,000 shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock. 
 
4 
 
Furthermore, in connection with the closing of the Cloudbreak Combination (the Cloudbreak Closing), (i) GigCapital2 has agreed to repay or cause to be repaid on behalf of Cloudbreak certain debt obligations of Cloudbreak of approximately $28 million and (ii) the Significant UpHealth Stockholders have agreed to subject 5,500,000 of their shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like) that they would receive upon the closing of the UpHealth Combination (the UpHealth Closing) to potential forfeiture and transfer (such transfer, the Business Combination Share Adjustment) to the Members (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) in connection with a Valuation Shortfall (defined below) on the 540th day from the Closing Date (as defined in the Cloudbreak BCA) (or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day) (the Measurement Date) as provided in the Cloudbreak BCA. A Valuation Shortfall shall occur if the dollar volume-weighted average price for the GigCapital2 Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg through its HP function (set to weighted average) or if not available on Bloomberg, as reported by Morningstar (the VWAP) for the ten trading days preceding the Measurement Date (the Reference VWAP) is less than $13.64, and the amount of such Valuation Shortfall is the difference between $13.64 and the Reference VWAP. In the event that a Valuation Shortfall occurs, the amount of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock that the Significant UpHealth Stockholders shall forfeit to the Members will be the lesser of (i) the Adjustment Amount (defined below) and (ii) 5,500,000 (or, if the Adjustment Amount equals 5,500,000, the Adjustment Amount). The Adjustment Amount means the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (A) the Aggregate Valuation Shortfall (defined below), divided by (B) the Reference VWAP. The Aggregate Valuation Shortfall means the product of (A) the amount of the Valuation Shortfall, multiplied by (B) 11,000,000. 
 As stated in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated February 4, 2021, on January 29, 2021, GigCapital2 executed a First Amendment to the UpHealth BCA with the parties to the UpHealth BCA, solely to amend Schedule 7.06(C) of the UpHealth BCA (the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 1) for the purpose of revising the formula used to calculate the Thrasys Incentive Amount as such term is used in the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 1. The terms of the Cloudbreak BCA were not modified in connection with the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 1. 
 As stated in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated March 26, 2021, on March 23, 2021, GigCapital2 executed a Second Amendment to the UpHealth BCA with the parties to the UpHealth BCA, solely to amend Schedule 7.06(C) of the UpHealth BCA (the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 2) for the purpose of further revising the formula used to calculate the Thrasys Incentive Amount as such term is used in the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 2. The terms of the Cloudbreak BCA were not modified in connection with the UpHealth BCA Amendment No. 2. 
 Incentive Plan 
 In connection with the Business Combinations, GigCapital2 will adopt, subject to the approval of the stockholders of GigCapital2, an equity incentive award plan for GigCapital2 with an initial award pool of GigCapital2 Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the amount that is equal to ten percent (10%) of the shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock outstanding as of immediately after the UpHealth Closing and the Cloudbreak Closing (rounded up to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the Thrasys Incentive Amount, which plan shall include an evergreen provision pursuant to which such award pool will automatically increase on each of January 1, 2022 and each anniversary thereof during the effectiveness of such plan by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) of the shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock issued and outstanding as of 12:01 a.m. (Central Time) on such date and (ii) such lesser amount determined by the GigCapital2 Board, and which plan shall be effective at and after UpHealth Closing and the Cloudbreak Closing.

Upon the closing of the transactions, the combined company will be named UpHealth, Inc. and will continue to be listed on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol UPH. 
 1st Extension 
 The Companys initial public offering prospectus and amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that the Company initial had until December 10, 2020 (the date which was 18 months after the consummation of the Offering) to complete the Business Combination. As stated in the Form 8-K filed with SEC dated December 8, 2020, the Company held its 2020 Annual Stockholders Meeting (the Annual Meeting) and the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that extended the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination transaction from December 10, 2020 to March 10, 2021. The Companys stockholders elected to redeem 579,881 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (Common Stock), which represents approximately 3.4% of the shares that were part of the units that were sold in the Companys initial public offering. 
 At the Annual Meeting, of the 22,245,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote, 18,625,346 shares were represented, constituting a quorum. 
 2nd Extension 
 As stated in the Form DEF 14A filed with the SEC dated February 12, 2021, the Company invited the stockholders of the Company to attend a special meeting (the Special Meeting) to be held on March 8, 2021 to vote to amend (the 2nd Extension Amendment) the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended by the Certificate of Amendment, dated December 8, 2020, our Charter) to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a Business Combination (as defined above) (the Extension) from March 10, 2021 (the date which is 21 months from the closing date of the Companys initial public offering of our units (the IPO)) to June 10, 2021 (the date which is 24 months from the closing date of the IPO) (the Extended Date). The Special Meeting was subsequently moved to March 10, 2021 as announced by the Company on the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021. The purpose of the 2nd Extension Amendment was to provide the Company more time to complete the Business Combinations, which the Board believed was in the best interests of our stockholders. The Companys stockholders elected to redeem 1,852,804 shares of the Companys Common Stock, which represents approximately 10.7% of the shares that were part of the units that were sold in the Companys initial public offering. 
 At the Special Meeting, of the 21,665,119 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote, 14,438,191 shares were represented, constituting a quorum. The Companys stockholders approved the 2nd Extension Amendment. 
 PIPE Subscription Agreement 
 On January 20, 2021, GigCapital2 entered into subscription agreements (the PIPE Subscription Agreements), each dated January 20, 2021, with certain institutional investors (the PIPE Investors), including Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., the placement agent for the private placements under the PIPE Subscription Agreements, pursuant to which, among other things, GigCapital2 agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combinations, an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares (the PIPE Shares) of GigCapital2s common stock (the Common Stock) to the PIPE Investors at $10.00 per share. 
 The obligations to consummate the subscriptions are conditioned upon, among other things, all conditions precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Note Subscription Agreements (as defined below) having been satisfied or waived, and the closing of the transaction contemplated by the PIPE Subscription Agreements occurring concurrently with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Note Subscription Agreements. 
 Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements, GigCapital2 agreed that, prior to the closing of the Business Combinations, GigCapital2 will file with the SEC (at GigCapital2s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares (the Resale Registration Statement), and GigCapital2 will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement declared effective upon the closing of the Business Combinations, but no later than 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies GigCapital2 that it will not review the Resale Registration Statement) after the closing of the Business Combinations, subject to customary conditions and covenants. 
 
6 
 
On February 16, 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC, which the Company amended in a subsequent filing with the SEC on March 26, 2021. This registration statement registers the resale of the PIPE Shares, par value $0.0001 per share of the Common Stock of the Company, by the selling stockholders named in the prospectus (or their permitted transferees) who are to be issued the PIPE Shares in a private placement immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination. 
 The PIPE Shares were not issued and outstanding at the time of the Special Meeting of GigCapital2s stockholders held to approve the Business Combinations that was held on March 10, 2021. Further, the holders of the PIPE Shares will not receive any proceeds from the trust account established in connection with GigCapital2s initial public offering in the event GigCapital2 does not consummate an initial business combination by the June 10, 2021 deadline in its current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In the event the Business Combinations are not approved by GigCapital2 stockholders or the other conditions precedent to the consummation of the Business Combination are not met, then the PIPE Shares will not be issued and GigCapital2 will seek to withdraw the registration statement prior to its effectiveness. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | Subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Business Combination 
 In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Our Founders and management team have agreed to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination (the Founder Shares) and the shares of Common Stock underlying the private placement units purchased by them in June 2019 (the Placement Shares). As a result, we would need only 4,911,158, or approximately 33%, of the 14,817,315 public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved. 
 
7 
 
We will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, provided, that we may also decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | We issue (other than in a public offering for cash) a number of shares of common stock that would either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Any of our management team or substantial security holders (as defined by the rules of the NYSE) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our management team or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The issuance or potential issuance of shares of our common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combination and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SECs proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are voted at a stockholder meeting held to consider the initial business combination. 
 We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until December 10, 2020 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account. 
 Redemption Rights 
 At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders (but not our Founders or management team) may seek to redeem their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, by converting such shares into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders (but not our Founders or management team) with the opportunity to sell their shares of common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. 
 
8 
 
We may also require public stockholders seeking redemption, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in street name, to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. This fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to do so prior to the time that we know that the proposed business combination will be consummated. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. Thus, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders. 
 Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the time designated in the proxy statement to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his, her or its redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he, she or it is a record holder or his shares are held in street name, in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his, her or its broker and requesting delivery of his, her or its shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled We will require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect redemption rights in connection with a blank check companys business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his, her or its redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him, her or it to deliver his, her or its certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the consummation of the business combination during which he, she or it could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his, her or its shares in the open market before actually delivering his, her or its shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a continuing right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered his, her or its certificate or shares. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holders election to convert his, her or its shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his, her or its certificate or shares in connection with an election of such shares redemption and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he, she or it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate or shares (physically or electronically). 
 If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public holders. Furthermore, if the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights will not be entitled to convert their shares into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, as applicable. We will thereafter promptly return any shares delivered by public stockholders. In such case, public stockholders may only share in the assets of the trust account upon our liquidation. This may result in public stockholders receiving less than they would have received if the business combination was completed and they had exercised redemption rights in connection therewith due to potential claims of creditors. If we would be left with less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as a result of the holders of public shares properly demanding redemption of their shares, we will likely be unable to consummate a business combination.

Our Founders and management team have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares of common stock to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by June 10, 2021, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Founders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. 
 Under the Delaware General Corporation law (DGCL), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. However, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will proceed as provided for in our amended and restated certificate as described above. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the expiration of the time periods described above and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the procedures required by Section 280 of the DGCL, which would limit the amount and duration of our stockholders liability with respect to liquidating distributions as described above. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. 
 We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than ten business days to effectuate such distribution. Our Founders and management team have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the Founder Shares and the Placement Shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses. 
 Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us redeem or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as described elsewhere herein. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot make any assurance of the amount we will be able to return to our public stockholders. 
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after June 10, 2021, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 As stated in the Form 8-K filed with SEC dated December 8, 2020, the Company held its 2020 Annual Stockholders Meeting (the Annual Meeting) and the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that extends the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination transaction from December 10, 2020 to March 10, 2021. 
 Further, as stated in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated March 10, 2021, the Company held a special stockholder meeting, which the Companys stockholders approved the second amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certification of Incorporation that extends the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination transaction from March 10, 2021 to June 10, 2021. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Although we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. 
 The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: 
 

 | Our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our outstanding rights and warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. 
 If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. 
 Employees 
 We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, common stock, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
