Item 1. Business
Overview & Strategy
Cimpress is a strategically focused group of more than a dozen businesses that specialize in mass customization, via which we deliver large volumes of individually small-sized customized orders for a broad spectrum of print, signage, photo merchandise, invitations and announcements, writing instruments, packaging, apparel and other categories. Mass customization is a core element of the business model of each Cimpress business and is a competitive strategy which seeks to produce goods and services to meet individual customer needs with near mass production efficiency. We discuss mass customization in more detail further below.
We have grown substantially over our history, from $0.2 billion of revenue in fiscal year 2006 to $2.6 billion of revenue in fiscal year 2021, and as we have grown we have achieved important benefits of scale. However, we also believe it is critical for us to “stay small as we get big”. By this we mean that we need to serve customers and act and compete with focus, nimbleness and speed that is typical of smaller, entrepreneurial firms but often not typical of larger firms. This is because we face intense competition across all our businesses, and we must constantly and rapidly improve the value we deliver to customers. To stay small as we get big, our strategy calls for us to pursue a deeply decentralized organizational structure which delegates responsibility, authority and resources to the CEOs and managing directors of our various businesses.
Specifically, our strategy is to invest in and build customer-focused, entrepreneurial mass customization businesses for the long term, which we manage in a decentralized, autonomous manner. We drive competitive advantage across Cimpress through a select few shared strategic capabilities that have the greatest potential to create Cimpress-wide value. We limit all other central activities to only those which absolutely must be performed centrally.
This decentralized structure is beneficial in many ways. We believe that, in comparison to a more centralized structure, decentralization enables our businesses to be more customer focused, to make better decisions faster, to manage a holistic cross-functional value chain required to serve customers well, to be more agile, to be held more accountable for driving investment returns, and to understand where we are successful and where we are not. 
The select few shared strategic capabilities into which we invest include our (1) mass customization platform ("MCP"), (2) talent infrastructure in India, (3) central procurement of large-scale capital equipment, shipping services, major categories of our raw materials and other categories of spend, and (4) peer-to-peer knowledge sharing among our businesses. We encourage each of our businesses to leverage these capabilities, but each business is free to choose whether or not to use these services. This optionality, we believe, creates healthy pressure on the central teams who provide such services to deliver compelling value to our businesses.
We limit all other central activities to only those which must be performed centrally. Out of more than 14,000 employees we have fewer than 80 who work in central activities that fall into this category, which includes tax, treasury, internal audit, general counsel, sustainability, corporate communications, consolidated reporting and compliance, investor relations, capital allocation and the functions of our CEO and CFO. We seek to avoid bureaucratic behavior in the corporate center; however we have developed, through experience, guardrails and accountability mechanisms in key areas of governance including cultural aspects such as a focus on customers or being socially responsible, as well as operational aspects such as the processes by which we set strategy and financial budgets and review performance, or the policies by which we ensure compliance with information privacy laws.
This strategy has proven to be of great value to us during the COVID-19 crisis; we could not have reacted as proactively, effectively or quickly had we not put in place our strategy and organizational structure several years ago. Our decentralized model allowed our businesses to respond quickly to local restrictions, customer needs, and the health and safety of our team members, and leaders shared information and best practices across the group. Our shared strategic capabilities in procurement helped us to address supply chain risks and partner with our suppliers to delay our payments to them, the mass customization platform helped us to route orders between production facilities when needed due to temporary closures, and our central finance and legal teams secured the financial flexibility to navigate this period of uncertainty.
Our Uppermost Financial Objective
Our uppermost financial objective is to maximize our intrinsic value per share. We define intrinsic value per share as (a) the unlevered free cash flow per diluted share that, in our best judgment, will occur between now and the long-term future, appropriately discounted to reflect our cost of capital, minus (b) net debt per diluted share. We define unlevered free cash flow as free cash flow plus interest expense related to borrowings.
This financial objective is inherently long-term in nature. Thus an explicit outcome of this is that we accept fluctuations in our financial metrics as we make investments that we believe will deliver attractive long-term returns on investment. 
We ask investors and potential investors in Cimpress to understand our uppermost financial objective by which we endeavor to make all financially evaluated decisions. We often make decisions in service of this priority that could be considered non-optimal were they to be evaluated based on other financial criteria such as (but not limited to) near- and mid-term revenue, operating income, net income, EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow. 
Mass Customization
Mass customization is a business model that allows companies to deliver major improvements to customer value across a wide variety of customized product categories. Companies that master mass customization can automatically direct high volumes of orders into smaller streams of homogeneous orders that are then sent to specialized production lines. If done with structured data flows and the digitization of the configuration and manufacturing processes, setup costs become very small, and small volume orders become economically feasible.

The chart illustrates this concept. The horizontal axis represents the volume of production of a given product; the vertical axis represents the cost of producing one unit of that product. Traditionally, the only way to manufacture at a low unit cost was to produce a large volume of that product: mass-produced products fall in the lower right-hand corner of the chart. Custom-made products (i.e., those produced in small volumes for a very specific purpose) historically incurred very high unit costs: they fall in the upper left-hand side of the chart. Mass customization breaks this trade off, enabling low-volume, low-cost production of individually unique products. Very importantly, relative to traditional alternatives mass customization creates value in many ways, not just lower cost. Other advantages can include faster production, greater personal relevance, elimination of obsolete stock, better design, flexible shipping options, more product choice, and higher quality. 

Mass customization delivers a breakthrough in customer value particularly well in markets in which the worth of a physical product is inherently tied to a specific, unique use or application. For instance, there is limited value to a sign that is the same as is used by many other companies: the business owner needs to describe what is unique about his or her business. Likewise, a photo mug is more personally relevant if it shows pictures of someone’s own friends and family. Before mass customization, producing a high-quality custom product required high per-order setup costs, so it simply was not economical to produce a customized product in low quantities.
We believe that the business cards sold by our Vistaprint business provide a concrete example of the potential of our mass customization business model to deliver significant customer value and to develop strong profit franchises in large markets that were previously low growth and commoditized. Millions of very small customers (for example, home-based businesses) rely on Vistaprint to design and procure aesthetically pleasing, high-quality, quickly-delivered and low-priced business cards. The Vistaprint production operations for a typical order of 250 standard business cards in Europe and North America require less than 14 seconds of labor for all of pre-press, printing, cutting and packaging, versus an hour or more for traditional printers. Combined with advantages of scale in graphic design support services, purchasing of materials, our self-service online ordering, pre-press automation, auto-scheduling and automated manufacturing processes, we allow customers to design, 
configure, and procure business cards at a fraction of the cost of typical traditional printers with very consistent quality and delivery reliability. Customers have very extensive, easily configurable, customization options such as rounded corners, different shapes, specialty papers, “spot varnish”, reflective foil, folded cards, or different paper thicknesses. Achieving this type of product variety while also being very cost efficient took us almost two decades and requires massive volume, significant engineering investments and significant capital. Business cards is a mature market that, at the overall market level, has experienced continual declines over the past two decades. Yet, for Vistaprint, pre-pandemic, this remained a growing category and was highly profitable, and thus provides an example of the power of mass customization. Even though we do not expect many other products to reach this extreme level of automation, we do currently produce many other product categories (such as flyers, brochures, signage, mugs, calendars, pens, t-shirts, hats, embroidered soft goods, rubber stamps, photobooks, labels and holiday cards) via analogous methods whose volume and processes are well along the spectrum of mass customization relative to traditional suppliers and thus provide great customer value and a strong, profitable and growing revenue stream.
Market and Industry Background
Mass Customization Opportunity
Mass customization is not a market itself, but rather a business model that can be applied across global geographic markets, to customers from varying businesses (micro, small, medium and large), graphic designers, resellers, printers, teams, associations, groups, consumers and families, to which we offer products such as the following:
Large traditional markets undergoing disruptive innovation
The products, geographies and customer applications listed above constitute a large market opportunity that is highly fragmented. We believe that the vast majority of the markets to which mass customization could apply are still served by traditional business models that force customers either to produce in large quantities per order or to pay a high price per unit. 
We believe that these large and fragmented markets are moving away from small traditional suppliers that employ job shop business models to fulfill a relatively small number of customer orders and toward businesses such as those owned by Cimpress that aggregate a relatively large number of orders and fulfill them via a focused supply chain and production capabilities at relatively high volumes, thereby achieving the benefits of mass customization. We believe we are early in the process of what will be a multi-decade shift from job-shop business models to mass customization.
Cimpress’ current revenue represents a very small fraction of this market opportunity. We believe that Cimpress and competitors who have built their business around a mass customization model are “disruptive innovators” to these large markets because we enable small-volume production of personalized, high-quality products at an affordable price. Disruptive innovation, a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, describes a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the 
bottom of a market (such as free business cards for the most price sensitive of micro-businesses or low-quality white t-shirts) and then moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors (such as those in the markets mentioned above).
We believe that a large opportunity exists for major markets to shift to a mass customization paradigm and, even though we are largely decentralized, the select few shared strategic capabilities into which we centrally invest provide significant scale-based competitive advantages for Cimpress.
We believe this opportunity to deliver substantially better customer value and to therefore disrupt large traditional industries can translate into tremendous future opportunity for Cimpress. Until approximately our fiscal year 2012, we focused primarily on a narrow set of customers (highly price-sensitive and discount-driven micro businesses and consumers) with a limited product offering. Through acquisitions and via significant investments in our Vistaprint business, we have expanded the breadth and depth of our product offerings, extended our ability to serve our traditional customers and gained a capability to serve a vast range of customer types.
As we continue to evolve and grow Cimpress, our understanding of these markets and their relative attractiveness is also evolving. Our expansion of product breadth and depth as well as new geographic markets has significantly increased the size of our addressable market opportunity. We base our market size and attractiveness estimates upon considerable research and analysis; however, our estimates are only approximate. Despite the imprecise nature of our estimates, we believe that our understanding is directionally correct and that we operate in an enormous aggregate market with significant opportunity for Cimpress to grow as we continue delivering a differentiated and attractive value proposition to customers.
Today, we believe that the revenue opportunity for low-to-medium order quantities (i.e., still within our focus of small-sized individual orders) in the four product categories below is over $100 billion annually in North America and Europe combined and at least $150 billion annually if you include other geographies and consumer products:
•Small format marketing materials such as business cards, flyers, leaflets, inserts, brochures and magazines. Businesses of all sizes are the main end users of short-and-medium run lengths (per order quantities below 2,500 units for business cards and below 20,000 units for other materials).
•Large format products such as banners, signs, tradeshow displays, and point-of-sale displays. Businesses of all sizes are the main end users of short-and-medium run lengths (less than 1,000 units).
•Promotional products, apparel and gifts including decorated apparel, bags and textiles, and hard goods such as pens, USB sticks, and drinkware. The end users of short-and-medium runs of these products range from businesses to teams, associations and groups, as well as consumers.
•Packaging products, such as corrugated board packaging, folded cartons, bags and labels. Businesses are the primary end users for short-and-medium runs (below 10,000 units).
Cimpress’ recent acquisition of 99designs, which operates within our Vistaprint business, combined with organic investment in design services, has extended our total addressable market. Vistaprint researched the design spend in two of its largest markets, the U.S. and Germany, and found that small businesses spend approximately $6 billion annually on design services in these two markets, exclusive of the purchases of the print or digital products that the designs enhance. Even more importantly, this research found that small businesses in these markets that purchase design services represent the majority of the addressable market for print and digital marketing materials. We believe that a broader complement of design services should enable Vistaprint to retain customers longer as their needs evolve, as well as both attract new customers and serve existing customers with more complex products and therefore access more of our total addressable market.
Our Businesses
Cimpress businesses include our organically developed Vistaprint business, plus previously independent businesses either that we have fully acquired or in which we have a majority equity stake. Prior to its acquisition, each of our acquired companies pursued business models that embodied the principles of mass customization. In other words, each provided a standardized set of products that could be configured and customized by customers, ordered in relatively low volumes, and produced via relatively standardized, homogeneous production processes, at prices lower than those charged by traditional producers.
Our businesses collectively operate across North America and Europe, as well as in India, Japan, Brazil, China and Australia. Their websites typically offer a broad assortment of tools and features allowing customers to create a product design or upload their own complete design and place an order, either on a completely self-service basis or with varying levels of assistance. Some of our businesses also use offline techniques to acquire customers (e.g., mail order, telesales). The combined product assortment across our businesses is extensive, including offerings in the following product categories: business cards, marketing materials such as flyers and postcards, digital and marketing services, writing instruments, signage, canvas-print wall décor, decorated apparel, promotional products and gifts, packaging, design services, textiles and magazines and catalogs. Also, we have responded to customer needs with new pandemic-related design templates for existing products as well as launching new products like face masks.
The majority of our revenue is driven by standardized processes and enabled by software. We endeavor to design these processes and technologies to readily scale as the number of orders received per day increases. In particular, the more individual jobs we receive in a given time period, the more efficiently we can sort and route jobs with homogeneous production processes to given nodes of our internal production systems or of our third-party supply chain. This sortation and subsequent process automation improves production efficiency. We believe that our strategy of systematizing our service and production systems enables us to deliver value to customers much more effectively than traditional competitors.
Our businesses operate production facilities throughout the geographies listed above, with over 3.3 million square feet of production space in the aggregate across our owned and operated facilities. We also work extensively with several hundred external fulfillers located across the globe. We believe that the improvements we have made and the future improvements we intend to make in software technologies that support the design, sortation, scheduling, production and delivery processes provide us with significant competitive advantage. In many cases our businesses can produce and ship an order the same day they receive it. Our supply chain systems and processes seek to reduce inventory and working capital and improve delivery speeds to customers relative to traditional suppliers. In certain of our company-owned manufacturing facilities, software schedules the near-simultaneous production of different customized products that have been ordered by the same customer, allowing us to produce and deliver multi-part orders quickly and efficiently.
We believe that the potential for scale-based advantages is not limited to focused, automated production lines. Other advantages include the ability to systematically and automatically sort through the voluminous “long tail” of diverse and uncommon orders in order to group them into more homogeneous categories, and to route them to production nodes that are specialized for that category of operations and/or which are geographically proximate to the customer. In such cases, even though the daily production volume of a given production node is small in comparison to our highest-volume production lines, the homogeneity and volume we are able to achieve is nonetheless significant relative to traditional suppliers of the long tail product in question; thus, our relative efficiency gains remain substantial. For this type of long-tail production, we rely heavily on third-party fulfillment partnerships, which allow us to offer a very diverse set of products. We acquired most of our capabilities in this area via our investments in Exaprint, Printdeal, Pixartprinting and WIRmachenDRUCK. For instance, the product assortment of each of these four businesses is measured in the tens of thousands, versus Vistaprint where product assortment is dramatically smaller on a relative basis. This deep and broad product offering is important to many customers.
    Our businesses are currently organized into the following five reportable segments:
1.Vistaprint: 

Consists of the operations of our Vistaprint-branded websites in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and Japan. This business also includes our Vistaprint Corporate Solutions business which serves medium-sized businesses and large corporations and our 99designs business which provides graphic design services.

Our Vistaprint business helps more than 15 million micro businesses (companies with fewer than 10 employees) create attractive, professional-quality marketing products at affordable prices and at low volumes. With Vistaprint, small businesses are able to create and customize their marketing with easy-to-use digital tools and design-templates, or by receiving expert graphic design support. In October 2020, Vistaprint acquired 99designs to expand its design offering via a worldwide community of more than 
150,000 talented designers to make it easy for designers and clients to work together to create designs they love. Vistaprint’s average order value is about $50, and customers spend about $100 per year; yet Vistaprint has historically had gross margins of about 60% and advertising spend as a percent of revenue of about 15%. Vistaprint has had strong free cash flow conversion as its e-commerce model leads to collections from customers prior to the production and shipment of customer orders.
Upload & Print:
Our Upload & Print businesses are organized in two sub-groups. We refer to these reportable segments as PrintBrothers and The Print Group, each of which focuses on serving graphic professionals: local printers, print resellers, graphic artists, advertising agencies and other customers with professional desktop publishing skill sets. Upload and print businesses have an average order value of about €100 and annual per customer revenue of over €600. Gross margins vary by business but average about 30% due to wholesale-like pricing and the wide variety of products produced both in owned facilities as well as via third-party fulfillers. Advertising spend as a percent of revenue is about 5%.

2.PrintBrothers: Consists of our druck.at, Printdeal, and WIRmachenDRUCK businesses. PrintBrothers businesses serve customers throughout Europe, and primarily in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. 
3.The Print Group: Consists of our Easyflyer, Exaprint, Pixartprinting, and Tradeprint businesses. The Print Group businesses serve customers throughout Europe, and primarily in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. 
4.National Pen: 

Consists of our National Pen business and a few smaller brands operated by National Pen that are focused on customized writing instruments and promotional products, apparel and gifts for small- and medium-sized businesses.

National Pen serves more than a million small businesses annually across more than 20 countries. Marketing methods are typically direct mail and telesales, as well as a growing e-commerce site. National Pen operates several brands focused on customized writing instruments and promotional products, apparel and gifts for small- and medium-sized businesses. National Pen’s average order value is about $200 - $250, and annual revenue per customer is about $300. Gross margins have historically been about 55% with highly seasonal profits driven in the December quarter. Significant inventory and customer invoicing requirements in this business drive different working capital needs compared to our other businesses.
5.All Other Businesses: 
Includes a collection of businesses combined into one reportable segment based on materiality: BuildASign, the largest of the these businesses with strong profitability and cash flow, and Printi and YSD, small early-stage businesses operating at modest losses, by which Cimpress is expanding into new markets.

BuildASign is an e-commerce provider of canvas-print wall décor, business signage and other large-format printed products, based in Austin, Texas. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we closed a small acquisition under BuildASign in a new product category. 
As the online printing leader in Brazil, Printi offers a superior customer experience with transparent and attractive pricing, reliable service and quality. 
YSD is a startup operation that provides end-to-end mass customization solutions to brands and intellectual property owners in China, supporting multiple channels including retail stores, websites, WeChat and e-commerce platforms to enhance brand awareness and competitiveness, and develop new markets.

Central Procurement
Given the scale of purchasing that happens across Cimpress’ businesses, there is significant value to coordinating our negotiations and purchasing to gain the benefit of scale. Our central procurement team negotiates and manages Cimpress-wide contracts for large-scale capital equipment, shipping services and major categories of raw materials (e.g., paper, plates, ink). The Cimpress procurement team is also available on an as-requested basis to help with procurement improvements, tools and approaches across other aspects of our businesses’ purchases. 
We are focused on achieving the lowest total cost in our strategic sourcing efforts by concentrating on quality, logistics, technology and cost, while also striving to use responsible sourcing practices within our supply chain. Our efforts include the procurement of high-quality materials and equipment that meet our strict specifications at a low total cost across a growing number of manufacturing locations, with an increasing focus on supplier compliance with our sustainable paper procurement policy as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct. Additionally, we work to develop and implement logistics, warehousing, and outbound shipping strategies to provide a balance of low-cost material availability while limiting our inventory exposure.
Technology
Our businesses typically rely on proprietary technology to attract and retain our customers, to enable customers to create graphic designs and place orders on our websites, and to aggregate and produce multiple orders in standardized, scalable processes. Technology is core to our competitive advantage, as without it our businesses would not be able to produce custom orders in small quantities while achieving the economics that are more analogous to mass-produced items.
We are building and using our MCP which is a cloud-based collection of software services, APIs, web applications and related technology offerings that can be leveraged independently or together by our businesses and third parties to perform common tasks that are important to mass customization. Cimpress businesses, and increasingly third-party fulfillers to our various businesses, can leverage different combinations of MCP services, depending on what capabilities they need to complement their business-specific technology. The capabilities that are available in the MCP today include customer-facing technologies, such as those that enable customers to visualize their designs on various products, as well as manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics technologies that automate various stages of the production and delivery of a product to a customer. The benefits of the MCP include improved speed to market for new product introduction, reduction in fulfillment costs, improvement of product delivery or geographic expansion, improved site experience, automating manual tasks and avoiding IT expense (through a reduction in expenses related to maintaining/licensing software). Over time, we believe we can generate significant customer and shareholder value from increased specialization of production facilities, aggregated scale from multiple businesses, increased product offerings and shared technology development costs.
We intend to continue developing and enhancing our MCP-based customer-facing and manufacturing, supply chain and logistics technologies and processes. We develop our MCP technology centrally and we also have software and production engineering capabilities in each of our businesses. Our businesses are constantly seeking to strengthen our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through engineering improvements in areas like 
automation, lean manufacturing, choice of equipment, product manufacturability, materials science, process control and color control. 
Each of our businesses uses a mix of proprietary and third-party technology that supports the specific needs of that business. Their technology intensity ranges from significant to light, depending on their specific needs. Over the past few years, an increasing number of our businesses have begun to modernize and modularize their business-specific technology to enable them to launch more new products faster, provide a better customer experience, more easily connect to our MCP technologies, and leverage third-party technologies where we do not need to bear the cost of developing and maintaining proprietary technologies. For example, our businesses are increasingly using third-party software for capabilities such as content management, multivariate testing tools and data warehousing, which are areas that specialized best-in-class technologies are better than the proprietary technologies they have replaced. This allows our own engineering and development talent to focus on artwork technologies, product information management and marketplace technologies from which we derive competitive advantage.
In our central Cimpress Technology team and in an increasing number of our decentralized businesses, we have adopted an agile, micro-services-based approach to technology development that enables multiple businesses or use cases to leverage this API technology regardless of where it was originally developed. We believe this development approach can help our businesses serve customers and scale operations more rapidly than could have been done as an individual business outside Cimpress.
Information Privacy and Security
    Each Cimpress business is responsible for ensuring that customer, company and team member information is secure and handled in ways that are fully compliant with relevant laws and regulations. Because there are many aspects of this topic that apply to all of our businesses, Cimpress has a central security team that defines security policies, deploys security controls, and provides services and embeds security into the development processes of our businesses. This team works in partnership with each of our businesses and the corporate center to measure security maturity and risk, and provides managed security services in a way that allows each business to address their unique challenges, lower their cost, and become more efficient in using their resources. 
Shared Talent Infrastructure
We make it easy, low cost, and efficient for Cimpress businesses to set up and grow teams in India via a central infrastructure that provides all the local recruiting, onboarding, day-to-day administration, HR, and facilities management to support these teams, whether for technology, graphic services, or other business functions. Most of our businesses have established teams in India leveraging this central capability, with those teams working directly for the respective Cimpress business. This is another example of scale advantage, albeit with talent, relative to both traditional suppliers and smaller online competitors that we can leverage across Cimpress. 
Competition

We estimate that Cimpress has a total addressable market of over $100 billion in North America and Europe, where it is the market leader in the transformation from traditional highly fragmented off-line production to online/mass customized approaches that deliver higher quality, faster speed and lower cost. We believe that this market is at least $150 billion annually if you include other geographies and consumer products. Additionally, as described above, through the acquisition of 99designs and organic investment in Vistaprint, we have also expanded this total addressable market to now include the large market for design services. Though Cimpress is the largest business in our space, we still represent a small fraction of the overall market, and believe there is significant room for growth over the long-term future.
The markets for the products our businesses produce and sell are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed, with many existing and potential competitors. We have very low market share relative to the total. Within this highly competitive context, our businesses compete on the basis of breadth and depth of product offerings; price; convenience; quality; technology; design content, tools, and assistance; customer service; ease of use; and production and delivery speed. It is our intention to offer a broad selection of high-quality products as well as related services at competitive price points and in doing so, offer our customers an attractive value proposition. Our current competition includes a combination of the following:
•traditional offline suppliers and graphic design providers
•online printing and graphic design companies
•office superstores, drug store chains, food retailers, and other major retailers targeting small business and consumer markets
•wholesale printers
•self-service desktop design and publishing using personal computer software
•email marketing services companies
•website design and hosting companies
•suppliers of customized apparel, promotional products, gifts, and packaging
•online photo product companies
•internet retailers
•online providers of custom printing services that outsource production to third party printers
•providers of digital marketing such as social media and local search directories
Today’s market has evolved to be much tougher in terms of competition. This evolution, which has been going on for 20 years, has led to major benefits for customers in terms of lower prices, faster lead times, and easier customer experience. Cimpress and its businesses have proactively driven, and benefited from, this dynamic. The mass customization business model first took off with small format products like business cards, post cards and flyers, and consumer products like holiday cards. As the model has become better understood and more prevalent, and online advertising approaches more common, the competition has become more intense. We are seeing these types of small format products growing at rates slower than some other product categories, and we continue to derive significant profits from these small format products. Conversely, there are other product areas that have only more recently begun to benefit from mass customization, such as signage, promotional products, apparel and gifts, textiles and packaging. Here, we see higher rates of growth, but with a wider variety of profit outcomes as we continue to scale our offering in these areas. There is also a geographic overlay to these trends. For example, in developing markets like India and Brazil where these products are more recently available in an online marketplace, we see stronger growth across all product areas, whereas the market in countries such as Germany is far more mature and therefore more slow growing. Some of these trends were distorted over the last year because of the pandemic, which temporarily altered demand and behavior patterns. 
We anticipate that the overall competitive landscape described above has already begun to change as a result of the pandemic, in the following ways:
•New business formation: Economic data shows that new business formation has increased meaningfully during the pandemic in our top markets: U.S., UK, France, and Germany. This often happens in a recession out of necessity: people who lose employment need to make ends meet and so start their own businesses. We have an opportunity to serve millions of individuals who take up self-employment or freelance roles because of our ability to serve the needs of those customers – we have demonstrated this in past recessions and expect to be able to do so again.
•E-commerce acceleration: We believe that the shift from traditional to mass customized models has accelerated as shelter-at-home experiences are making e-commerce and service-at-a-distance experiences like ours more mainstream. For example, McKinsey has estimated in the U.S. that 10 years of e-commerce adoption was compressed into three months during the pandemic[1]. There are similar trends in other countries around the world, according to an OECD policy brief[2], among other sources. 
•Accelerated shift from traditional production to mass customized sources: Conditions have been very difficult for small traditional suppliers and we believe some of these businesses are unlikely to last beyond the period of time that they are receiving government aid. We see this through industry news coverage[3] and research[4] and through some of our businesses that sell to these suppliers as bookings from those channels have been harder hit. One of the reasons for this is small traditional suppliers have a narrower 
range of products than Cimpress so as demand for those products dropped significantly, even if temporary, there was less room to maneuver. 
•Share gains versus online players: Additionally, we believe that some of the online competitors that offer a more limited product portfolio or lack scale advantages have had less flexibility to navigate changing customer demand levels. We saw online competitors[5] who report their revenue publicly down year over year 35% - 40% during the 6-month period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, while our own revenue declined just 10% in the same period.

Social and Environmental Responsibility
Above and beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we expect all parts of Cimpress to conduct business in a socially responsible, ethical manner. Examples of these efforts are:
•Environmental: We regularly evaluate ways to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment. In terms of combating climate change, we have established and centrally fund a company-wide carbon emissions reduction program to lower the emissions associated with our operations at a rate slightly exceeding the 1.5oC target pathway, and expect to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. This commitment expands upon our previous 2°C target, established in alignment with the 2015 United Nations Global Change Conference (COP21 “Paris Climate Accord”), and now includes the emissions from our supply chain (Scope 3). Our plan includes investments in energy-reducing infrastructure and equipment, renewable energy sourcing, and examination of our substrate and logistics choices for further opportunities to reduce total emissions. We are on track to meet this commitment, and we seek to make further improvements each year going forward.
We have converted the vast majority of the paper we print on in our Cimpress-owned production facilities to FSC-certified paper (FSC® C143124, FSC® C125299), the leading certification of responsible forestry practices. This certification confirms that the paper we print on comes from responsibly managed forests that meet high environmental and social standards. Currently over 85% of the paper that we print on in our facilities is FSC-certified, and we seek to move that to 100% over time. We have also committed to influencing our third-party suppliers to materially expand their use of responsibly forested paper for the products that they customize on our behalf, as well as using either FSC-certified corrugate or packaging materials containing recycled content from post-consumer sources to help ensure our packaging does not contribute to deforestation.
We also have also recently committed to improve the profile of our plastic-based packaging and products in line with the targets set by the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, co-sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme. This includes a focus on reduced plastic usage, increased recyclability, and support of products that contain recycled materials.
•Fair labor practices: We make recruiting, retention, and other performance management related decisions based solely on merit, based on an individual’s ability to do their job with excellence and in alignment with the company’s strategic and operational objectives. We do not tolerate discrimination on any basis protected by human rights laws or anti-discrimination regulations, and we strive to do more in this regard than the law requires. We are committed to a work environment where team members are treated with respect and fairness, and have invested in education and awareness programs for team members to make further improvements in this area. We value individual differences, unique perspectives and the distinct contributions that each one of us can make to the company.
•Team member health and safety: We require safe working conditions at all times to ensure our team members and other parties are protected, and require legal compliance at a minimum at all times. We require training on – and compliance with – safe work practices and procedures at all manufacturing facilities to ensure the safety of team members and visitors to our plant floors. Given the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have held our team member health and safety as a top priority, and have implemented measures such as remote working for members who are able to and increased safety 
measures at our manufacturing and customer service centers including additional cleaning and sanitary protocols.
•Ethical supply chain: It is important to us that our supply chain reflects our commitment to doing business with the highest standards of ethics and integrity. Each Cimpress business is responsible to ensure its supply chain does not allow for unacceptable practices such as environmental crimes, child labor, slavery or unsafe working conditions.
