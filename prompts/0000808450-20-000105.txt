Our 2020 Accomplishments
2020 has been an unprecedented year for the world, our customers and our Company. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a multitude of business challenges that Navistar has effectively navigated as an “essential business.” Through the dedication of our employees, communities, dealer network, customers and drivers who use our products, Navistar aided in ensuring the reliable and continued movement of essential goods throughout North America. Navistar 4.0, our enterprise-wide strategy with our customers at its core, is supported by strategic initiatives that guide decision-making and investments. This strategy has guided us in the most challenging of circumstances and reinforces our confidence that we are on the right track to grow our business.
In 2020, we made several notable advancements on our Navistar 4.0 strategy:

1. | People: Our focus on creating a high-performance organization and culture proved to be one of Navistar 4.0’s strongest pillars this past year in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our efforts resulted in our organization being able to rapidly adapt to continually changing circumstances in our business, our communities and our employees' own lives. The most notable achievements and changes we were able to implement were:


• | We immediately adapted our agile and collaborative visual management-based teaming practices to online tools and practices that were quickly scaled across the organization. Once stay at home orders started, we were able to quickly train and ramp up our organization to operate remotely with minimal disruption to most operations.


• | Significant senior leadership changes were made that strengthen Navistar’s focus on those critical areas that will help us achieve our objectives and guide us into the future:


▪ | Persio V. Lisboa became President and Chief Executive Officer. He is a strong leader with a proven record of driving results. Troy Clarke became Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, dedicated to ensuring a smooth leadership transition and to continue to manage discussions with Navistar's strategic partner, TRATON.


▪ | We integrated sales, marketing and aftersales under one leader to further improve the complete commercial process for customers and dealers.


▪ | To further drive operating efficiencies, Navistar global operations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Global Export business, have been combined under the same leadership with our current integrated operations of procurement, product development, manufacturing and supply chain.


• | Navistar and our employees are also proud of being leaders in our communities in this year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and social unrest. As a company that thrives with diversity, inclusion and social engagement, Navistar leaders, dealers and employees stepped up and demonstrated our values. Some notable examples of this are:


▪ | International dealers served nearly 10,000 meals to truckers all over the US and Canada.


▪ | International Truck, Triumph Business Capital and Triumph Pay donated more than 6,500 face masks and 6,000 bottles of hand sanitizer to drivers who came in for service at select International Truck dealerships.


▪ | Our South American engine subsidiary MWM Motores provided two mobile generators to power a soccer arena in Sao Paulo that had been converted into a temporary hospital with 200 beds.


▪ | We established the “International Cares” and “IC Bus Cares” programs to provide innovative financing solutions for our customers and to offer free access to services like our fleet management tools International 360 and IC Bus 360.


▪ | We established a platform for our employees to share concerns, thoughts and ideas on dealing with a multitude of topics going on in our world through a series of online sessions entitled “Shifting Gears.” These sessions connected employees of all backgrounds and experiences across Navistar helping them deal with ongoing events.


▪ | Navistar also moved quickly at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure a safe environment for our employees by aggressively implementing safety protocols at all our facilities.

Our people are our greatest asset, and Navistar will continue to work to keep our employees safe, healthy and productive to become the employer of choice in the industry.

2. | Performance: Continued to create sustainable long-term performance advantage within our products and services by investing in those areas with the greatest impact on revenue growth and performance. During 2020, we balanced the need to preserve financial flexibility with the ability to meet our long-term financial goals under Navistar 4.0. Our notable achievements in 2020 include:

• | Took deliberate and concerted actions to preserve liquidity and performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those actions included:


▪ | Enhanced liquidity through completion of a $600 million senior secured notes offering.


▪ | Maintained production as an “essential business” by working closely with our supply chain.


▪ | Maintained service at parts distribution centers ("PDCs"), used truck centers and dealers, in part by leveraging e-commerce and data analytics.


▪ | Implemented IT solutions to maintain critical operations and projects to increase flexibility to work from home.


▪ | Reduced cash outflows by retiming non-critical capital improvement and IT projects, and targeted deferrals and other permanent cost reduction actions.


• | Moved forward with key capital infrastructure projects, including:


▪ | Broke ground on the new San Antonio, TX plant, a $250M investment that will incorporate the latest manufacturing principles - digital factory, connected machinery, robust lean manufacturing processes and cloud analytics - to enable predictive quality and maintenance, and allow data-driven decisions to be made real time on the shop floor.


▪ | Broke ground on a $125M Huntsville, AL plant expansion that will support the production of next-generation big-bore powertrains developed with the TRATON Group.


• | Signed a new 20-year agreement with the city of Tulsa, OK for our bus plant that will keep the IC Bus school bus manufacturing facility at the Tulsa International Airport.


• | Successfully extended our relationship with Cummins Inc. ("Cummins") to supply Cummins engines through the next two greenhouse gas emissions cycles for medium duty ("MD") and heavy duty ("HD") big-bore engines.


• | Piloted new dealer sales processes, capturing new customers and launching new training modules, as well as continued to expand our portfolio of Fleetrite® products and the number of our dedicated retail service parts locations.


• | Launched the International® HX® Series, the next generation of severe service trucks in late 2020, with increased component commonality that further aligns our full product line with our Project Compass initiative.


3. | #1 Choice: Significant progress has been made in identifying and focusing on key markets where we believe we have a differentiated value proposition, defining how we will operate in each of these markets, and how to prove to our customers that we are their #1 choice. Our strategy to communicate our clear value proposition has now expanded to include electric vehicles and self-driving technology, laying the foundation for the transportation infrastructure of the future. Notable achievements in 2020 include:


• | Further solidified our on-going relationship with one of the nation’s largest fleet carriers by delivering our 5,000th LT series truck in 3 ½ years.


• | Announcement of our first order for 18 Electric CE school buses for the province of British Columbia in Canada. We expect to begin delivery of the units in 2021.


• | Formed a partnership with TuSimple, Inc. ("TuSimple"), a global self-driving technology company to co-develop SAE Level 4 self-driving trucks.


• | Formed partnerships with 7 leading telematics service providers ("TSP") that we believe covers at least 70% of the TSP market.


• | Through our NEXT e-Mobility solutions business unit, we signed a master services agreement with In-Charge Energy to provide charging infrastructure and consulting services to Navistar and our electric vehicle customers.


• | Became a member of CharIN E.V. which is a global association that focuses on electric vehicle adoption, to further establish Navistar as a participant in the electric future of the commercial truck industry.


• | Launched the industry’s first holistic suite of products designed to minimize Total Cost of Ownership ("TCO") - Intelligent Fleet Care in OnCommand Connection.

We believe that these actions, coupled with our strategic alliance, and the proposed business combination, with TRATON SE and our winning culture anchored by our high performing cross-functional teams, will continue to drive our success.

Navistar 4.0 is built upon the right vision and the right strategy. We define success as an unparalleled customer experience, mutually beneficial relationships with employees, dealers, partners, customers and suppliers, and improved financial returns for our investors.
Our Operating Segments
We operate in four industry segments: Truck, Parts, Global Operations (collectively referred to as "Manufacturing operations"), and Financial Services, which consists of NFC and our foreign finance operations (collectively referred to as "Financial Services operations"). Corporate contains those items that do not fit into our four segments. Selected financial data for each segment can be found in Note 16, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Truck Segment
Our Truck segment manufactures and distributes Class 4 through 8 trucks and buses along with production of proprietary engines, primarily in the North America markets that include the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Our Truck segment also includes our truck export business under the International and IC brands. The proprietary engines produced in North America are primarily used in our trucks and buses. Our goal is to deliver the highest quality commercial trucks and buses. The Truck segment is our largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues.
We compete primarily in our Core (collectively referred to as school buses, Class 6 and 7 medium trucks, Class 8 heavy trucks and Class 8 severe service trucks) markets. The Truck segment's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Mexico consist principally of assembling components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as designing, engineering, and producing certain sheet metal components, including truck cabs, and proprietary engines.
The Truck segment's manufacturing operations also include the production of diesel engines, which are primarily used in our trucks. The operations at our engine manufacturing facility consist principally of the assembly of components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as machining operations relating to steel and grey-iron components. We market and distribute our commercial products through our dealers and directly to large fleets both domestically and internationally. Additionally, through our dealer network of 1,052 outlets in the U.S. and Canada, which includes 342 of Love’s Travel Stops locations, 89 outlets in Mexico, and our export truck operations, primarily in Latin America, we provide a comprehensive range of services and other support functions. In addition, our network of used truck centers and International certified used truck dealers in the U.S. and Canada provides trade-in support to our dealers and national accounts group, and markets all makes and models of reconditioned used trucks to owner-operators and fleet buyers.

The Truck business competes on many dimensions, including customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, uptime, and parts availability. The markets in which the Truck segment competes are subject to considerable volatility and fluctuation in response to cycles in the overall business environment. These markets are particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Government regulation has also impacted, and will continue to impact, trucking operations as well as the efficiency and specifications of trucking equipment.
The Class 4 through 8 truck and bus markets in North America are highly competitive. Major U.S.-controlled domestic competitors include PACCAR Inc. ("PACCAR"), which sells vehicles under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates in North America, and Ford Motor Company ("Ford"). Competing foreign-controlled domestic manufacturers include Freightliner and Western Star (both subsidiaries of Daimler-Benz AG ("Mercedes Benz")), Volvo and Mack (both subsidiaries of Volvo Global Trucks), and Hino (a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation ("Toyota")). In addition, smaller, foreign-controlled market participants such as Isuzu Motors America, Inc. ("Isuzu"), UD Trucks North America (a subsidiary of AB Volvo ("UD Trucks")), and Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. ("Mitsubishi") are competing in the U.S. and Canadian truck markets with primarily imported products. In Mexico, the major domestic competitors are Kenmex (a subsidiary of PACCAR) and Freightliner. In our primary truck export market of Latin America, we compete with many truck manufacturers, including PACCAR, Freightliner, and Mack.
Refer to Note 16, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for Truck sales to external customers.
Parts Segment
Our Parts segment provides customers with proprietary products needed to support the International commercial truck, IC Bus, proprietary engine lines, and export parts business, as well as our other product lines by providing customers with proprietary products together with a wide selection of other standard truck, trailer, and engine service parts. We distribute service parts through the dealer network that supports our trucks and engines. The Parts segment is our second largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues and generates a significant portion of our net income.
Our extensive dealer channel provides us with an advantage in serving our customers by having our parts available when and where our customers require service. Goods are delivered to our customers either through one of our twelve parts distribution centers operated out of North America, or through direct shipment from our suppliers. We have a dedicated parts sales team within North America, as well as national account teams focused on large fleet customers. We also serve our global markets through our dedicated export business which supports customers globally in Latin America, the Middle East, northern Africa, South Africa, Europe, Australia, Asia and Russia. In conjunction with the Truck sales and technical service group, we provide an integrated support team that works to find solutions to support our customers.
To be competitive, the Parts Segment must focus on customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, and parts availability. We sell a substantial amount of all-make parts for light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks ("All-Make parts"), which are common across OEM truck manufacturers. We sell remanufactured parts through our ReNEWed product line and private label products through our Fleetrite brand name. The dealers and fleets have multiple outlets to purchase All-Make parts including other OEMs (including but not limited to Freightliner, PACCAR, Mack and Volvo), independent distributors, and traditional retail outlets, including Fleetpride, TruckPro, and National Auto Parts Association ("Napa"). We sell a wide-range of proprietary parts and we are subject to varying degrees of competition for many of our proprietary parts from alternative parts-providers and independent remanufacturers.
Also included in the Parts segment is our Blue Diamond Parts, LLC ("BDP") joint venture with Ford, which manages the sourcing, merchandising and distribution of certain service parts for North America Ford diesel vehicles. Major competitors for our BDP joint venture include Alliant Power, Jasper Engine Transmissions, and Delphi Automotive. In October 2019, Ford notified the Company of its intention to dissolve the BDP joint venture effective October 2021.
Refer to Note 16, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for Parts sales to external customers.
 10

Global Operations Segment
Our Global Operations segment includes businesses that derive revenue from outside our Truck and Parts segments and primarily consists of the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, IIAA. IIAA is a leader in the South American mid-range diesel engine market, manufacturing and distributing mid-range diesel engines and providing customers with additional engine offerings in the agriculture, marine, genset, and light truck markets. Additionally, we also sell our engines to global OEMs for various on-and-off-road applications. We offer contract manufacturing services under IIAA's MWM brand to OEMs for the assembly of their engines, particularly in South America. IIAA has a very significant dealer network and parts distribution center, responsible for internal and export sales of spare parts. As part of the Global Operations segment, IIAA has engine manufacturing operations in Brazil. The Global Operations segment is our third largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues.
Our commercial products are marketed through our independent dealer network, which offers a comprehensive range of services and other support functions to our end users.
IIAA also has a commercial agreement with an Indian company, Mahindra Heavy Engines Ltd. ("Mahindra"), under which MWM engines (4.8L and 7.2L) are manufactured at a plant located in the Chakan Industrial Area in the city of Pune, India. The engines produced at that plant are exclusively sold by MWM outside of the Indian market, providing a cost competitive export platform in support of the Asian markets.
In Brazil, IIAA's engines compete with Cummins, Mercedes Benz, and Fiat Powertrain ("FPT") in the light and medium truck markets; Mercedes Benz, Cummins, Scania, MAN, Volvo, and FPT in the heavy truck market; Mercedes Benz in the bus market; New Holland (a subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V.), Sisu Diesel (a subsidiary of AGCO Corporation), and Deere & Company in the agricultural market; and Scania and Cummins in the stationary market.
Financial Services Segment
Our Financial Services segment provides and manages wholesale, retail, and lease financing of products sold by the Truck and Parts segments and their dealers. We also finance wholesale and retail accounts receivable. Substantially all revenues earned by the Financial Services segment are derived from supporting the sales of our vehicles and products. The Financial Services segment continues to meet the primary goal of providing and managing financing to our customers in U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets by providing or arranging cost-effective funding sources, while working to mitigate credit losses and impaired vehicle asset values. NFC provides wholesale financing for 100% of new Truck inventory sold to our dealers and distributors in the U.S. through the customary free interest period offered by NI. At October 31, 2020 and 2019, NFC retained floor plan financing for approximately 71% and 72% of the dealers, respectively, after the expiration of any free interest period. The Financial Services segment also facilitates financing relationships in other countries to support our Manufacturing Operations.
The Financial Services segment manages the relationship with Navistar Capital (a program of BMO Harris Bank N.A. and Bank of Montreal (together, "BMO")). Navistar Capital is our third-party preferred source of retail and lease customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the U.S. In addition, Navistar Capital Canada (also a BMO program) provides financing to support the sale of our products in Canada.
Engineering and Product Development
Our engineering and product development programs are focused on the development of new products, enhancements of current products, quality improvements and continuous material cost reductions across our product lines, complying with future regulatory requirements, and investigating future technologies for our product lines. We have shifted our investment focus to developing driver-centric designs with world class uptime and fuel economy that incorporates industry leading connected technologies utilizing Navistar’s OnCommand Connection ("OCC") open architecture telematics solution. In 2019, we completed the launch of the Horizon suite of vehicles for the Global markets and also launched the International CV Series in conjunction with General Motors Company ("GM") for the Class 4/5 market.
In 2020, Navistar’s product development programs were focused on developing advances in aerodynamics, powertrain and software systems that are increasing fuel efficiency in the International LT and RH Series on-highway vehicles. In addition, we will be developing further enhancements for our products in our Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) offerings, more fuel-efficient features, and engines to comply with the 2021 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions requirements. Navistar will continue to invest in ADAS, connected technologies and electric vehicles, working with strategic suppliers and partners. We believe that the alliance with TRATON Group will further expand our capabilities in these areas.
 11

We participate in very competitive markets with stringent regulatory requirements and rapid technology adoptions, and we continue to believe that our strong commitment to engineering and product development is required to drive long-term growth. Our engineering and product development costs were $321 million in 2020, compared to $319 million in 2019 and $297 million in 2018. We expect that GHG phase 2 regulations announced in 2016 will drive significant investments in product development by us and our competitors. We believe these investments will likely continue through 2027.
Employees and Human Capital
Part of Navistar’s values focus on developing and maintaining a world class workforce through personal accountability, teamwork, customer service and innovation. While fluctuations may occur within our workforce from year to year, we carefully manage our attrition, approving the replacement of key positions that we believe are critical to sustaining improved business performance. We also analyze departure data so we can continually improve upon the employee experience. Our employee turnover for US, salaried non-represented employees in 2020 was 11.9%. Our talent management and succession plan process at Navistar includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors, and a plan for talent development. In addition to compliance-related training which is completed by all employees annually, we offer a variety of leadership training modules. Safety is also a key priority for Navistar. Employees participate in numerous training sessions focused on this topic and metrics are reviewed regularly. Targets for a reduction in recordable Incident Frequency Rates (“IFR”) and Lost Time Case Rates (“LTCR”) are set annually. For 2020, we collectively met our targets. We achieved an overall IFR of 0.92, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.92 employees incurred an injury that resulted in recordable medical treatment. The LTCR was 0.26, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.26 individuals experienced an incident that resulted in days away from work.
Navistar aligns its base and variable pay with the external market, to ensure external competitiveness while maintaining internal value or equity within the organization. Our short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to provide a variable pay opportunity to reward the attainment of key financial and operational goals and shareholder value creation. The mix among base compensation, short-term incentives and long-term incentives is designed to align with the competitive market. Navistar provides a variety of benefits including but not limited to "Doctor On Demand™" (telemedicine), tuition reimbursement for continuing education, adoption assistance, vacation buy program, and parental leave.
Our Diversity and Inclusion vision at Navistar is to empower an inclusive, engaged and unique culture that drives a sense of belonging, and respects and celebrates our differences.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion related to the risk associated with labor and work stoppages.
Patents and Trademarks
We seek and obtain patents on our inventions and own a significant patent portfolio. Additionally, many of the components we purchase for our products are protected by patents that are owned or controlled by the component manufacturer. We license third-party patents for the manufacture of our products and also grant licenses of our patents. The monetary royalties paid or received under these licenses are not material.
Our primary trademarks are an important part of our worldwide sales and marketing efforts and provide clear identification of our products and services in the marketplace. To support these efforts, we maintain, or have pending, registrations of our primary trademarks in those countries in which we do business or expect to do business. We grant licenses under our trademarks for consumer-oriented goods, such as toy trucks and apparel, outside the product lines that we manufacture. The monetary royalties received under these licenses are not material.
 12

Supply
We purchase raw materials, parts, and manufactured components from numerous third-party suppliers. To avoid duplicate tooling expenses and to maximize volume benefits, single-source suppliers fill a majority of our requirements for parts and manufactured components. Some parts and manufactured components are generic to the industry while others are of a proprietary design requiring unique tooling, which require additional effort to relocate. However, we believe our exposure to a disruption in production as a result of an interruption of raw materials and supplies is no greater than the industry as a whole.
Our costs for trucks and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel, precious metals, resins, and petroleum products. We continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of market-based commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes, material substitution, alternate supplier resourcing, global sourcing efforts, and hedging activities. The objective of this strategy is to ensure cost stability and competitiveness in an often-volatile global marketplace. Generally, the impact of commodity cost fluctuations in the global market will be reflected in our financial results on a delayed basis, depending on many factors including the terms of supplier contracts, special pricing arrangements, and any commodity hedging strategies employed.
Impact of Government Regulation
Truck and engine manufacturers continue to face significant governmental regulation of their products, especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters. For a discussion of the impact of Environmental Regulations on our business, refer to Impact of Environmental Regulation in Item7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The tariffs imposed upon key raw materials and our products increases the amount of capital expenditures for such materials and products and the overall costs of doing business. Moreover, tariffs present uncertainty about future barriers to global trade which may require significant adjustments to our supply chain management to control the costs of operation. Such changes may result in higher costs for our products to our customers which may affect our competitive position.
Government regulation of truck and engine manufacturers' products included on-highway emissions standards which require reducing allowable particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"). 
In 2010, the initial phase-in of onboard diagnostic ("OBD") requirements commenced for the initial family of truck engines and those products were certified. The phase-in for the remaining engine families occurred in 2013. Canadian heavy-duty engine emissions regulations essentially mirror those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"). In Mexico, we offer EPA 2004 and Euro IV engines that comply with current standards in that country. Mexico lowered NOx emission standards in 2019 and will be lowering NOx emission standards in 2021 to Euro V and VI levels, respectively. Navistar Heavy Duty Diesel ("HDD") engines meet the EURO V and VI with current controls technology.
Truck manufacturers are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal, state, and local regulations. As the engine is one of a truck's primary sources of noise, we invest a great deal of effort to develop strategies to reduce engine noise. We are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act ("Safety Act") and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ("Safety Standards") promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA").
Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. Because our products use fossil fuels, they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation, such as a cap and trade program, affecting the cost of fuels. We are complying with EPA and NHTSA GHG emissions rules through use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available. The EPA and NHTSA adopted a final rule in October 2016 with a second phase of federal GHG emission and fuel economy regulations. This rule contains significantly more stringent emissions levels for engines and vehicles and, while these costs are difficult to estimate, they will require substantial investments of capital. The GHG emission standards in the rule will take effect for vehicles and engines manufactured in calendar year 2021 and be implemented in three stages culminating in model year 2027. We continue to assess the impact of the rule on us and our stakeholders as we develop our product planning for that period.
Canada's version of fuel economy and GHG emission regulations are substantially aligned with U.S. fuel economy and GHG emission regulations. Canada has finalized heavy duty phase 2 GHG rulemaking, which is substantially similar to EPA regulations with more stringent requirements for heavy haul tractors.
 13

California's GHG emission rules for heavy duty vehicles are equivalent to EPA phase 1 rules. California is in the process of adopting its phase 2 equivalent rules and also has an optional lower emission standard for NOx. California has stated its intention to lower NOx standards for California-certified engines and has requested that the EPA lower its standards for engines manufactured in 2024 and 2027. In June 2016, several regional air quality management districts in California and other states, as well as the environmental agencies for several states, petitioned the EPA to adopt lower NOx emission standards for on-road heavy duty trucks and engines. In November 2018, the EPA announced the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative” which will begin the regulatory process for a reduced NOx emissions regulation while also streamlining compliance and certification requirements. In addition to lower NOx, the EPA and California may consider other actions, including extending warranty periods, mandating sales of zero emission trucks, and requiring certification of zero emission heavy duty vehicles. We continue to monitor and intend to participate in this rulemaking. We expect that heavy duty vehicle and engine fuel economy and GHG emissions rules will be under consideration in other global jurisdictions in the future. These standards will require significant investments of capital, will significantly increase costs of development for engines and vehicles, and will require us to incur administrative costs arising from implementation of the standards.
The EPA's rule in October 2015 for the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone of 70 parts per billion could lead to future lower emission standards for substances that contribute to ozone, including NOx from vehicles, at the federal and state levels. We may require additional capital expenditures to comply with such lower emission standards.
Our facilities may be subject to regulation related to environmental matters, including climate change, and climate change itself may also have some impact on our operations.
