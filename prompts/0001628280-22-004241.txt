ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We started Metromile based on the simple observation that the physical world is being increasingly digitized, that this digital data can be used to better estimate the future, and that the best opportunity to create value for everyday customers in an increasingly predictable world is to reinvent insurance, one of the largest and most important global markets.
At its core, insurance financially protects the insured customer from the occurrence of specific future events. If these events can be more accurately estimated, using data and data science, then the insurance provided can be more accurately priced — lower likelihood events would cause the price of insurance to go down and higher likelihood events would cause the price of insurance to go up. The proliferation of sensor data, from cars, mobile phones, and elsewhere, means we have a greater ability to estimate the likelihood of future events and, thus, help many customers who are overpaying for insurance save money.
We founded Metromile in 2011 to realize this opportunity and tackle the broken auto insurance industry. With data science as our foundation, we offer our insurance customers real time, personalized auto insurance policies, priced and billed by the mile, with rates based on precisely how and how much they actually drive, instead of using the industry standard approximations and estimates that make prices unfair for most customers.
Through our digitally native offering, built around the needs of the modern driver, we believe our per-mile insurance policies save our customers, on average, 47% over what they were paying their previous auto insurer. We base this belief on data our customers self-reported in 2018 with respect to premiums paid to providers before switching to Metromile.
We believe the opportunity for our personalized per-mile insurance product is significant. Federal Highway Administration data indicates that approximately 35% of drivers drive more than half the total miles driven. We believe there is a correlation between the number of miles driven and the number of insurable losses. An October 2016 report by the Insurance Information Institute noted that the increase in claims frequency appears directly linked to the increase in the number of miles driven. Notwithstanding the relationship between miles driven and claims, auto insurance premiums have historically been priced based on a driver’s “class” — and drivers are charged the same basic premium rate as others in their class no matter the actual miles driven. In the traditional pricing model, a driver’s age, credit score, accident history, and geography influences the premium paid more than the actual miles driven. Thus, the 35% of drivers who account for more than half the miles driven are not paying premiums based on how often they are behind the wheel and increasing the potential for an insurable loss claim. We believe the traditional pricing model is inherently unfair to the majority of drivers — the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven — as they are effectively subsidizing the minority of drivers who are high-mileage drivers. By offering auto insurance using a per-mile rate and then billing each customer monthly based on their actual miles driven, we are able to provide significant savings to the vast majority of drivers, the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven. Customers can simply use their connected car or use a Metromile Pulse device ("The Pulse") to share their data with us — which includes miles driven, and in certain states where permitted by insurance regulators, driving habits, such as phone use, speeding, hard-braking, accelerating, cornering, and location. Our customers are able to choose when and how to drive and share this information with us to realize these data driven savings every day. See “— Our Technology Platform” for more information regarding The Pulse and data collection.
Our offering is also more appealing to the modern digital consumer beyond just the savings we offer. Customers sign up, access customer support, and file claims entirely through our mobile app. Claims are handled quickly and, in many cases, are fully automated. Our proprietary technology underpins these unique capabilities. We are built using data science at our core — we know how to acquire and unlock the predictive value of the data generated by the car, mobile phones, and elsewhere. This translates into a better experience, higher customer retention rates, lower cost of customer acquisition, less fraud, less servicing expense, and greater operating profits.
Our core technology capabilities have also unlocked a powerful new business for us — Metromile Enterprise, a cloud-based enterprise software solution for insurance carriers that provides them advanced claims automation and fraud detection tools, improving their operating margins, while earning us a share of their insurance premium as a service fee. With Metromile Enterprise already in market, we have started to realize returns on our earlier technology investments and expect to see this business help the large incumbents in the insurance industry transition into a more digital world, while helping us quickly grow our earnings.
Today, we consider ourselves a leading digital insurance platform, providing unique and advantaged products to auto insurance customers in the United States and auto insurance companies in the United States and globally.
The U.S. auto insurance market is massive, dominated by insurers stuck on legacy technology infrastructure who offer antiquated services. U.S. personal auto insurers write approximately $250.0 billion of premiums each year, with no carrier currently achieving more than 20% market share. We believe we are strategically positioned to succeed as industry incumbents struggle to meet the significant structural changes underway in an increasingly digital world. The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized modern mobility, while connected and autonomous technologies are drastically changing consumer relationships with vehicles. As we scale and accumulate more data, we believe that we can deliver increasingly better service, pricing and experiences for customers across all stages of the policy lifecycle.
Through our core competencies in technology and operating as a full-stack insurance carrier, we are already achieving durable margin advantages that we believe will allow us to maintain a competitive edge in pricing and generate incremental cash to invest in future growth for the years and decades ahead. We believe our focus on technology will allow us to gain efficiencies through automation and the ability to scale.
We believe our customers are loyal. We measure this, in part, by our average overall net promoter score, or NPS, of 50 as of end of year 2021. The NPS metric is a management tool used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty and indicates the percentage of customers rating their likelihood to recommend a product or service to a friend or colleague. After 51 days of joining Metromile, we ask each new customer the likelihood that they will recommend Metromile to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0 to 10. Scores between 0-6 are considered detractors and scores between 9-10 are considered promoters. To arrive at Metromile’s NPS score in a given month, the percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters. Scores between 7-8 are considered passive and are counted toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0. By recommending our services to their friends and family, we believe our customers demonstrate their satisfaction and loyalty to our services. We believe our overall NPS of 50 demonstrate our customer satisfaction and loyalty to Metromile.
We have trained our predictive models to deliver what we believe is one of the most sophisticated pricing engines in the industry using the approximately three billion miles of customer driving data we have collected since our founding. Our data-driven approach is designed to improve the accuracy of risk-profiling customers while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of fraud and losses.
We built these models in the early days by carefully selecting our first markets, acquiring data and quickly iterating on our proprietary rating and underwriting models, building out our own customer service and claims functions, and reinventing as we gained new data and experience.
As our models have matured, we have also learned how to more efficiently and effectively acquire customers, as these models can also be applied to estimate the lifetime profitability of any potential new customer lead based on key indicators. We migrated from marketing in well-defined offline channels to using a variety of more cost-effective digital solutions for our customer funnel, where we can tailor ad targeting, content, and a quote funnel to each individual prospect.
We leverage a diverse mix of channel strategies to optimize our marketing efforts including search, display, and social marketing, as well as app acquisition, aggregators (like compare.com, The Zebra, and Everquote), our free app Ride Along (akin to a try before you buy experience) and key automotive original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, partnerships. Our experience and financial profile equip us to excel in our next phase of growth across the United States.
We believe we have put together one of the best leadership teams in our industry who have significant experience with top technology and insurance companies. They will help us execute our ambitious growth plans through our unique approach to insurance. We believe that we have a truly differentiated value proposition that puts customers in the driver’s seat. Through data science, we have built an impactful business that we believe will help transform the insurance industry.
Business Developments
Acquisition of Metromile, Inc. by Lemonade, Inc.
On November 8, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) with Lemonade, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Lemonade”), Citrus Merger Sub A, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lemonade (“Acquisition Sub I”) and Citrus Merger Sub B, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Lemonade (“Acquisition Sub II”). The Agreement provides that, pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) Acquisition Sub I will merge with and into the Company (the “First Merger” and the effective time of the First Merger, the “First Effective Time”)), with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the “Initial Surviving Corporation”), and (ii) the Initial Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Acquisition Sub II (the “Second Merger”), with Acquisition Sub II continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lemonade (the First Merger, the Second Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, collectively, the “Proposed Transaction”). The Proposed Transaction implies a fully diluted equity value of approximately $500 million, or an enterprise value of about $340 million net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2021. Under the terms of the Agreement, stockholders of the Company will receive shares of Lemonade common stock at a ratio of 19:1. The transaction is conditioned on customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. The Boards of Directors of both the Company and Lemonade have each approved the Proposed Transaction as well as stockholders of the Company.
Our Technology Platform
Our proprietary technology platform is a key competitive advantage. Through the collection of high frequency telematics data, we have developed a platform capable of understanding moment-by-moment driving behavior. Using data science and machine learning, we build predictive models to accurately determine the risk profiles of our customers and offer fairer, more accurate pricing.
Our customer-friendly, intuitive interface paired with The Pulse creates a seamless user experience. The Pulse device easily plugs into the diagnostic port of our customer’s car and transmits data over wireless cellular networks. The Pulse device provides visibility into customer braking behavior at each intersection, miles driven, speed, acceleration, hard-braking, cornering, and location. In addition, through our OEM partnerships, we will be able to connect directly with vehicles and stream the same sensor data without a device. The more data we collect, the better our predictive models will become, allowing us to enhance our unit economics and value to consumers.
The moment of truth for all insurers is when a customer submits a claim. In a traditional experience, a customer is required to go through many hurdles simply to get their car repaired after an accident, causing customer frustration. The fundamental cause of this high friction experience is that up to 17% of claims are fraudulent and insurers are forced to implement onerous processes and look at every claim with suspicion, where trust is eroded with the customer. Alternatively, our platform is capable of algorithmically reconstructing the accident scene and letting the majority of drivers have the claim nearly instantly approved. We create loyal customers by helping them get back on the road quickly and seamlessly.
We have been able to identify and reduce fraudulent claims by three times the rate of our industry peers. The structural costs associated with high fraud rates in the auto insurance industry are ultimately passed on to consumers. Our fraud detection advantage ultimately improves our loss ratio, which allows us to keep our costs lower and pass on additional savings to our customers.
The net result of our technology advantage is a fundamentally lower cost structure. Because premiums charged to the consumer ultimately reflect the underlying costs of the insurance business and its losses, we have developed a competitive advantage beyond our pricing model. Built from the ground-up with technology and sensors first, we have developed a durable competitive advantage with a highly efficient and streamlined operation.
The Metromile app
From the outset, we believed the experience with an auto insurer should go beyond being a compulsory purchase, selected based solely on price. With our app, our customers benefit from rich functionality, tools, and features. Prospects are able to sign up within minutes or try Ride Along to estimate and earn more savings. Aligned with our first value of creating loyal customers, we aim to stay engaged with our customers every step of the way.
Our app increases engagement and improves our relationship with customers by providing helpful features such as street sweeping notifications to help avoid parking tickets, get walking directions to their car, and monitor their car health. Everything needed to manage a policy can be done in the app, such as viewing policy information and documents, auto insurance ID cards, monthly billing summaries, and detailed trip maps. With an always-connected vehicle, we have an 85% stolen car recovery rate.
Metromile Enterprise
Metromile Enterprise is a cloud-based enterprise software offering for third party insurance carriers that was built on top of our sophisticated automated claims technology. The service helps carriers automate the claims processes for both customers and claims agents while reducing the cost of fraudulent claims through advanced fraud detection features. The service works cooperatively with existing property and casualty, or P&C, insurance enterprise software platforms and is priced based on a percentage of the insurance premium the service is used to help manage.
Our automation and fraud detection capabilities have allowed Metromile’s auto insurance claims program to detect three times more fraud than the industry average, benefiting our loss ratio, while reducing our loss adjustment expense ratio by an estimated 20% due to advanced automation. We saw an opportunity in applying these capabilities to help the broader P&C insurance industry transform and better manage their claims processes and are excited by the progress we’ve made since launching Metromile Enterprise in 2019.
Metromile Enterprise is not just for telematics-based auto insurance programs — the software helps global P&C insurers improve customer experience and reduce claim costs across a variety of use cases in auto, home, renters, pet, workers compensation and other specialized P&C insurance programs. This unique business allows us to diversify our revenue base into recurring, high-margin enterprise SaaS revenue, while actively participating in the digital transformation underway in the broader insurance markets, with minimal incremental cost. 
With respect to the platform’s specific feature set, our Metromile Enterprise offering consists of Report, Detect, Replay, and Streamline modules.
•Report: The secret to success with predictive models lies in gathering rich, reliably structured data at first notice of loss, or FNOL. The Report module is a smart digital FNOL solution for customer-facing data collection and call center representatives that creates opportunities for improved fraud detection, efficient downstream processing, and a “no-touch” claims experience.
•Detect: Our Detect module is an artificial intelligence, or AI, powered fraud detection tool trained to scan incoming claims in seconds and build a feedback loop with existing investigative experts. We help capture more fraud and cut costs by eliminating investigations on low probability claims.
•Portal: The Portal enables insurance carriers to offer their insureds a one-stop digital destination for filing claims, tracking updates on claims in progress and taking action on pending items. This solution helps improve claim handling efficiency and save claim adjuster time.
•Streamline: Streamline is a powered automation suite, enabled by sophisticated data science modeling, that reduces repetitive tasks done by claims handlers so that they can spend more time providing service for customers with more complex needs. The Streamline solution enables claims self-servicing to settle claims with efficiency.
Our platform architecture
We believe our platform provides us with a true competitive advantage. We built our technology from the ground-up with the secular shifts in insurance in mind. Our platform is built on a number of foundational architecture principles.
We are able to deliver a flexible and scalable platform where customer services can be added and evolved over time.
Through delivering micro-services, we ensure a constant evolution of the technology platform, both in terms of features supported as well as technology used. Micro-services also allow efficient scaling of the engineering organization, as it allows an ever-growing number of teams to work in parallel with the least dependency bottlenecks.
Our unified user interface is technology-agnostic and built on a back-end service that can enable a diverse range of clients.
This allows us to remain agnostic to mobile and web applications along with third-party integrations. We have the flexibility to isolate part of or all of our platform features for third-party integration both directly into a user experience and into the backend of a given platform. This provides us the opportunity to service different enterprises with different technology platforms.
Our offerings were created with the core ideas of resiliency and durability in mind to allow for uninterrupted scale.
All services are built to enable a distributed and horizontal scaling deployment. This not only supports our scalability but also provides resilience as distributed service instances can survive fault tolerances of individual instances or full zone fails.
We heavily leverage machine learning to underpin our business. From personalized pricing through to claims, our technology stack is critical to our success.
Industry and market opportunity
The U.S. auto insurance market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption as pricing and risk identification remain key components to drive competitive demand. Additionally, shifting consumer preferences toward an online environment creates opportunity for new entrants with a focus on customer experience.
•Massive market: In 2020, the U.S. personal auto insurance market generated in excess of $250 billion in premiums.
•Highly fragmented: Market share in the United States is fragmented with no carrier holding more than 20% market share. Additionally, 108 carriers generated greater than $100.0 million in premiums in 2020.
•Ripe for disruption: The auto insurance placement and claims process suffers from poor overall consumer experience, which is attributable to opaque and tiered pricing, lengthy sign-up processes, and arduous claims processes that are often long and repetitive. Additionally, traditional insurance carriers do not consider technology-driven developments to the auto industry when pricing risk. With a developing driver model including autonomous features and new means of transportation, additional factors need to be considered.
•Limited use of technology: The insurance market has typically relied on a number of factors to provide pricing and risk assessment information. Statistics like age, credit score, accident history, and geography have often been deciding factors that categorize drivers into buckets and price them accordingly. Technological developments and data science provide new applications to better understand individual driver risk, such as actual miles driven and driving behaviors, and are able to adjust pricing models to consider these variable factors. While other auto insurance providers consider an individual’s prior accident history, we believe Metromile is distinguished by further adjusting to real-time driving behavior. This real-time capture, we believe, allows Metromile to better understand each driver’s risk in ways that backward-looking algorithms, such as “good-driver rewards,” are unable to.
•COVID-19 pandemic: Although the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 remain uncertain and consumer demand for auto insurance may be impacted in a recessionary or stationary environment, a recent survey published by Capgemini SE found that 87% of global consumers prefer to use a personal vehicle to ensure safe travel, up from 57% in 2020. Further, the dramatic decline in miles driven during the second quarter of 2020 and the fact that legacy carriers were forced to react through ad hoc refund and rebate programs and were sued in class action lawsuits proves that the existing fixed priced insurance model is outdated.
Metromile is well positioned to capitalize on these tailwinds by providing a product that solves fundamental issues with auto insurance and fairly prices policies to individual drivers. This is driven by Metromile’s view that auto insurance today is unfair to most consumers, as insureds are broadly categorized into the same buckets and charged similar rates while still holding varying driving habits and vehicular uses. The distinction between this broad classification and a more technology and data driven approach to assessing risk underpins Metromile’s vision to change how insureds are assessed and charged.
Several areas within the personal lines auto space are most significant to understanding this unique market opportunity. The first and most important is regarding the traditional insurance model where insurance products are built for a “class of driver” rather than individual insureds. This foundational concept of pricing risk gained traction in the 1990s when carriers discovered independent factors such as credit score were good indicators of an individual’s driving habits and risk classification. Using additional rating variables like credit expanded segmentation via proxy and moved the industry further away from evaluating individual risk. The widespread use of such factors became industry norm where the process of receiving an insurance quote is dictated by several key factors that place customers into classes associated with varying risk levels and premium payments. While still broadly used today, this results in a significant bifurcation of insureds within each class level where drivers that have the same gender, geographic location, vehicle make, accident 
history, and credit score receive similar quotes. Other factors, however, still vary between two similar applications, the most significant and quantifiable being miles driven. This creates a pricing imbalance where a small portion of drivers within a class create significant liabilities because of their frequent driving habits. Drivers who infrequently use their vehicles therefore are subsidizing the higher risk of their peers by paying similar rates while having fundamentally different risk profiles. We believe this results in approximately 65% of drivers overpaying for personal auto insurance and 35% of drivers underpaying, as the Federal Highway Administration data indicates that approximately 35% of drivers drive more than half the total miles driven. We believe there is a correlation between the number of miles driven and the number of insurable losses. An October 2016 report by the Insurance Information Institute noted that the increase in claims frequency appears directly linked to the increase in the number of miles driven. Thus, the 35% of drivers who account for more than half the miles driven are not paying premiums based on how often they are behind the wheel and increasing the potential for an insurable loss claim. We believe the traditional pricing model is inherently unfair to the majority of drivers — the 65% of drivers who drive less than half the miles driven — as they are effectively subsidizing the minority of drivers who are high-mileage drivers.
To address this issue, Metromile has leveraged technology to create accurate methods of measuring car usage and charging drivers on a “per-mile” basis. Our product development has maintained a unique focus on understanding individual driver habits to provide more granular insight into the likelihood of requiring a claim. Metromile’s position as one of the only large carriers to offer this approach to pricing — and the only carrier solely focused on low mileage drivers — underpins its opportunity to capture market share and change the industry’s approach to risk assessment.
An additional factor supporting this market opportunity is the large market size and significant fragmentation found in personal lines auto insurance. With over $250.0 billion in annual premiums in the United States, personal auto insurance is one of the largest lines globally. An outsized number of companies operate in the space, pricing customers with varying risk demographics and underwriting a book that meets operational and loss standards. In a market with a relatively commoditized product, pricing, customer experience and added factors becomes significant to attracting new customers. Metromile has created a new competitive advantage that drives customer volume by differentiating their core product from large and traditional carriers. This large amount of fragmentation mixed with Metromile’s unique approach supports its ability to readily attract new customers by providing a different approach to pricing.
The tech enabled landscape within the automotive and broader industries has also been a key point of focus for Metromile. As the usage of smartphones and technology that collects individual consumer data becomes more widespread, so too do the opportunities for insurance companies to collect more data and conduct analytics on it. This pairs with innovation in the auto space changing the true risk of operating a vehicle. Autonomous driving, driving assistance features on vehicles, or the decrease in vehicular usage due to ride-share applications have all made the personal lines auto insurance landscape more complex with respect to individual risk that cannot be captured by a collection of data points like credit score and age. This creates a fundamental need to gain insight into individual usage and leverage this data to paint a better picture of what true risk and therefore price looks like.
Competitive strengths
•Structurally advantaged through data science. To date, we have collected approximately three billion miles of data through our core data engine. We built our engine from the ground up to realize a structural pricing and cost advantage in auto insurance. We collect our data through the next generation of connected vehicles, mobile and telematics devices to generate what we believe is the most granular and insightful data on driving behavior in the industry. We analyze data such as miles driven, speed, acceleration, hard-braking, cornering, and location to deliver market-leading intelligence. This enables us to provide highly personalized policies at scale and attractive unit economics. We currently deploy behavioral telematics, other than miles driven, in four of the eight states where we operate. We are building a durable competitive advantage through personalization, superior pricing, better fraud detection, approval automation and customer loyalty. The strength of our technological offering has even turned our infrastructure into a source of revenue. We offer our Metromile Enterprise services to a number of leading insurance carriers looking to digitize their platforms.
•Customer-oriented approach with member loyalty. We leverage our data advantage and technology to offer customers better experiences through our use of mobile technology. We were born as a digital-first entity and have invested meaningfully to develop a seamless mobile and online experience for customers long-underserved by the traditional auto insurance industry. Customers can quickly download and use our app and access our rich feature set, enabling a shorter time to receive a quote. They also receive real-time feedback on fuel consumption and driving behavior, while we are additionally automating claims through our AI enabled platform. We believe these features and customer experience have established member loyalty to our platform and cultivated a strong brand affiliation. As of December 31, 2021, Metromile’s one-year retention rate on new policies is 60%, which is the percentage of customers that remain with Metromile after two policy terms, and is inclusive of all cancellation reasons, whether initiated by the customer or by us. According to the California Department of Insurance, in 2020 in California, which is Metromile’s largest market, Metromile received 4 justified complaints, which was lower than the average number of justified complaints received by the 50 largest automobile carriers in terms of exposure counts (of which Metromile ranked 41st). Each exposure count represents an insured vehicle. In addition, in 2020 in California, Metromile ranked 41 out of 50 in terms of the ratio of justified complaints to exposure counts. In 2020, Metromile decreased its justified complaint count in California by over 50%.
•Full-Stack Insurance provider. In 2016, we became a full-stack carrier, enabling us to recapture economics from third-party providers. We have complete control over the entire process of writing a policy, from underwriting and investment discretion to the back-end processing that drives new customer acquisition and growth, leading to high capital-efficiency. Our premiums can grow with minimal increase in surplus, while mitigating large or tail losses. We partner with some of the leading reinsurers in the industry. Today, we are licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, with licenses active in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and writing business in eight 
states. We aim to be a fully national provider of insurance across 49 states and the District of Columbia in the future.
•Strategic partnerships in new channels. We are developing strategic partnerships with automotive giants that will help us to win sustainable market share. Our OEM partners can help us identify low mileage drivers based on the data collected from a newly purchased vehicle and target new customer segments with our product. Access to customers that fit our target demographic who are at a decision point in insurance buying post vehicle purchase is highly valuable and allows us to showcase our unique value proposition to the right customers at the right time. And, by connecting directly to vehicles, these connected car owners can bypass needing our Pulse device. 
•World-class talent. The Metromile team comprises a blend of experienced technology industry executives, the best data scientists and leading insurance industry veterans. Our diverse mix of talent has helped us look at the automotive insurance industry through an alternative lens. We pride ourselves on our unique DNA and fresh outlook. We focus on hiring the best talent from a wide array of backgrounds to provoke diversity of thought and ideas. Our leadership team exemplifies our foundation in data science. Dan Preston first trained as a data scientist and joined Metromile as Chief Technology Officer in 2013 before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. Outside of key leadership, Dan has built a tremendous team of technologists, insurance experts and finance veterans culled from companies including Progressive, Salesforce, and PricewaterhouseCoopers to the most innovative startups.
Our Operating Model
Our playbook for developing and growing markets is an iterative, deliberate methodology designed to ensure that all types of consumers, regardless of their “driver class”, receive competitive rates that deliver substantial savings, while pricing to accurately reflect their expected losses. Thus, as a market matures and achieves positive unit economics, we believe our ability to scale and deploy additional capital in that market increases. Our most mature markets have the largest market penetration and strongest unit economics, which is the result of a focused effort to both improve unit profitability and efficiency in Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC.
Our revenue and gross profit are significantly impacted by our reinsurance program, the terms of which vary from year-to-year. Our reinsurance program includes an upfront policy fee paid to us by the reinsurers for each new policy entering into the program, as a way for us to recover policy acquisition costs. We record this as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We then cede most of the premium earned on that policy to the reinsurance syndicate and earn back a share of the realized profit from the policy, over time, which is also recognized as other revenue.
Because our reinsurance program has varied year-to-year and the onboarding allowance portion of the program results in the recognition of more revenue during periods in which we sell more policies, we have seen a significant variance in our quarterly and annual revenue. For example, our other revenue and gross profit declined year-over-year in 2020 and 2019, primarily due to the upfront policy fee we received from our reinsurers for new policies sold in 2019 relative to 2020. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had other revenue of $29.2. million and $22.1 million, respectively. Our gross profit/(loss) declined to $(15.2) million from $(14.1) million for the same period.
We use reinsurance to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim. Our reinsurance arrangements provide for the transfer of a portion of our risk portfolio to a third-party in exchange for a share of the insurance premium, e.g., we cede a portion of the premium paid per policy. As we cede risk and premium, we not only transfer risk of loss, but are able to underwrite additional policies and generate additional premiums.
Effective as of April 30, 2021, the Company commuted all of its outstanding reinsurance agreements. For additional information, please see Note 10, Reinsurance, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Because of the effect that our reinsurance program has on our revenue and gross profit, we believe contribution profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a more useful metric to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the profitability of our insurance operation. Contribution profit is calculated as direct earned premium, plus investment income earned at the insurance company, minus direct losses, direct loss adjustment expense, and variable costs associated with the servicing of policies. Contribution margin is contribution profit divided by direct earned premium plus investment income earned at the insurance company. See “Metromile’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information regarding our use of contribution profit/(loss) and contribution margin and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.
Our negative gross margin decreased to (14.5)% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from (40.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher revenue in 2021, partially offset by reinsurance coverage on losses in 2020 combined with both increased frequency and severity of losses as well as claims related to Hurricane Ida in 2021. Our contribution margin has declined from 2020 to 2021, primarily due unfavorable prior period loss development.
As of December 31, 2021, one-year new customer retention was 60% for policies that completed their second term in the fourth quarter of 2021. We define retention as the percentage of new customers who remain with us after their first two policy terms, inclusive of all cancellation reasons.
Metromile’s Growth Strategy
Scale our position in existing markets. 
We have an established presence in our existing markets — eight states in the United States that represent approximately 30% of the market for drivers. Our data engine is helping us to continuously learn more about our customers and their driving behaviors, which allows us to improve price competitiveness in new segments. As our data aggregates over time, we become more sophisticated in our pricing, analysis and predictions while our competitors remain broadly stagnant. Our financial profile improves as we scale and refine our local market knowledge. This improved financial profile frees up more capital to invest in furthering our technical advantages and growing our customer base.
Expand nationally across the United States. 
We will apply our highly replicable model nationally, with a tailored approach to each state, driven by the regulatory environment and local market dynamics. This will allow us to expand rapidly and efficiently across different geographies while maintaining a high level of control over the specific strategy within each state. We aim to be in 49 states and the District of Columbia in the future. We do not yet have visibility on whether or not these 41 new markets will permit the use of behavioral telematics data to offer polices and premiums based on driving habits in addition to miles driven. As we expand into new markets, when appropriate, we plan to engage in discussion with state insurance regulators to expand our ability to use behavioral telematics, which we expect will evolve over time. Our data platform will continue to inform new and existing markets as we successfully scale.
Scale partnerships & key channels. 
Our existing channels have been continually optimized for lower CAC and heightened throughput. We market through a variety of channels, including direct-to-consumer advertisements, display, search, and social media marketing, search engine optimization, and customer referrals. Our products are customer-centric with an overall NPS of 50, and we benefit greatly from word-of-mouth marketing.
Cross-sell with new products and services. 
With active and loyal customers, we intend to build on that foundation to offer an expanded product offering. We believe that there is a compelling cross-sell opportunity for other insurance services including homeowners' insurance, and renters insurance, and car maintenance. Through a mix of strong partners and new internal product development, we expect to bring these products to market in an intuitive manner, consistent with the experience Metromile customers expect from us.
Investments
Our portfolio of investable assets is primarily held in cash, short-term investments, and available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and asset backed securities. We manage the portfolio in accordance with investment policies and guidelines approved by our board of 
directors, in consultation with legal counsel and as may be required to be approved by applicable regulatory authorities. We have designed our investment policy and guidelines to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital, and liquidity requirements of our operations setting guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the insurance industry. Many of our primary and direct competitors have well-established national brands, a longer operating history, and market similar products, including at prices comparable to ours. Our competitors include large national insurance companies such as Progressive, Allstate, and Nationwide, as well as up-and-coming companies and new market entrants in the InsurTech industry, some of whom also utilize telematics and offer forms of usage-based insurance. Several of these established national insurance companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, greater resources, access to additional capital, and more types of insurance coverage to offer the consumer, such as renters, homeowners, health and life, than we currently do. In particular, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase multiple other types of insurance coverage and “bundle” them together into one policy and, in certain circumstances, include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. We do not offer such “bundles” and are specialized in one type of insurance — personal automotive insurance. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products, we could face intense competition from traditional insurance companies that are already established in such markets.
Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, customer service, size, and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors, and have developed a platform and business model based on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and a stand out customer experience that we believe will be difficult for incumbent insurance providers to emulate and utilize like we have.
Telematics Device Production, Sourcing and Fulfillment
We utilize telematics technology to gather data that we use to underwrite insurance policies, bill customers, and manage claims and customer service. Our telematics hardware is designed and manufactured, and telematics data services are provided to us by a single third party. From a fulfillment perspective, we also use one third-party logistics company for our end-to-end physical inventory management process as well as the shipping and receiving of our telematics devices. We believe that we have good relationships with our vendors and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these vendors is not available. We continually review our customer demands against the capacity of our manufacturer and supplier with a view to ensuring that we are able to meet our customer commitments, reduce costs and operate more efficiently. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Technology and Security.”
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 384 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and electronic and physical security measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal, contractual, and other protections, we believe that factors such as the skill and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are large contributors to our success in the marketplace. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection on such enhancements to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
As of December 31, 2021, we have five issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States. The issued patents generally relate to determining the route and parking location of a vehicle, recording trip data associated with a vehicle, and estimating the usage of a vehicle based on refueling events. The issued patents are expected to expire between September 1, 2035 and January 11, 2036. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have trademark rights in our name, our logo, and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business.
Although we believe our intellectual property rights are valuable and strong, intellectual property rights are sometimes subject to invalidation or circumvention. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors — 
Risks Related to Our Business — Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.”
Regulation
Insurance Regulation 
Metromile is subject to insurance regulation in the jurisdictions in which we transact insurance through licensed insurance carrier and producer subsidiaries. Insurance regulatory authorities have broad administrative powers to regulate all aspects of an insurance carrier or producer’s business, including the powers to restrict or revoke licenses to transact business, and to levy fines and monetary penalties against insurers and insurance producers found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. Regulations to which the licensed insurance carrier and producer subsidiaries are subject include, but are not limited to: 
•prior approval of transactions resulting in a change of “control” (as such term is defined under the Insurance Holding Company System Registration Act of Delaware (the “Delaware Holding Company Act”)); 
•prior approval of transactions resulting in a change of “control” (as such term is defined under the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act of California (the “California Holding Company Act”)); 
•state-mandated premium rebates, refunds, or reductions as a result of potentially lower risk exposure due to the Coronavirus pandemic and related emergency orders; 
•approval of policy forms and premiums in each state in which the insurance carrier operates; 
•approval of intercompany service agreements in Delaware and California; 
•statutory and risk-based capital solvency requirements, including the minimum capital and surplus the insurance carrier must maintain pursuant to applicable laws and the CMA entered into as required by the Delaware Department of Insurance described above; 
•establishing minimum reserves that the insurance carrier must hold to pay projected insurance claims; 
•required participation by the insurance carrier in state guaranty funds; 
•restrictions on the type and concentration of the insurance carrier’s investments; 
•restrictions on the advertising and marketing of insurance; 
•restrictions on the adjustment and settlement of insurance claims; 
•restrictions on the use of rebates or other consideration to induce a policyholder to purchase insurance; 
•restrictions on the sale, solicitation, and negotiation of insurance; 
•restrictions on the sharing of insurance commissions and payment of referral fees with unlicensed persons; 
•prohibitions on the underwriting of insurance on the basis of race, sex, religion, and other protected classes; 
•restrictions on disparate treatment of similarly situated applicants and policyholders; 
•restrictions on the ability to use telematics to underwrite and price insurance policies, particularly in California; 
•restrictions on the use and weight of certain underwriting factors; 
•restrictions on the ability of the insurance carrier to pay dividends to us or enter into certain related party transactions without prior regulatory approval; 
•rules requiring the maintenance of statutory deposits for the benefit of policyholders; 
•privacy regulation and data security; 
•regulation of corporate governance and risk management; 
•periodic examinations of operations, finances, market conduct, and claims practices; and 
•required periodic financial reporting. 
The business of insurance is principally regulated at the state level, and the laws and regulations to which the licensed insurance carrier and producer subsidiaries are subject vary depending on the state. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to “state” include any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories. These rules are subject to change as state legislatures and regulatory agencies update their laws and regulations to address real and perceived issues and concerns. These laws and regulations are also subject to interpretation by courts. The NAIC and the National Council of Insurance Legislators (“NCOIL”) are the principal organizations tasked with establishing standards and best practices across the various states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories, and from time to time promulgate model rules and regulations that often are the basis for insurance rules and regulations adopted by such jurisdictions. We cannot predict precisely whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect us or the operations of the insurance carrier and producer subsidiaries. Interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes, regulations, and interpretations may be applied with retroactive effect, particularly in areas such as accounting or reserve requirements. 
Required Licensing 
The U.S. insurance carrier, Metromile Insurance Company, is domiciled and admitted in the state of Delaware to transact certain lines of property and casualty insurance. In addition to Delaware (the domiciliary state) and California (currently, a commercial domicile for the insurance carrier), Metromile Insurance Company maintains licenses to transact insurance in all states except Tennessee, and currently writes policies in Arizona, California, Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. No additional license applications are currently pending. 
The licensed insurance producer subsidiary, Metromile Insurance Services LLC, must maintain an insurance producer license in every state in which it sells, solicits, or negotiates insurance. Metromile Insurance Services LLC currently holds a resident insurance producer license in California and a non-resident license in Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. No additional license applications are currently pending. 
Insurance regulators have broad authority to restrict or revoke licenses of insurance carriers and producers who are found to be in violation of any applicable laws and regulations. 
Licensing of Our Employees 
Unless directly employed by the insurance carrier, any of our employees who sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance must be licensed insurance producers and must fulfill pre-licensing and annual continuing education and license renewal requirements. In certain states in which we operate, insurance claims adjusters are also required to be licensed and fulfill annual continuing education requirements. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation 
We are a member of an “insurance holding company system” under the Delaware Holding Company Act and the California Holding Company Act as the parent company of a wholly owned regulated insurance subsidiary. Under the insurance holding company system rules and regulations, Metromile Insurance Company is required to register with the insurance departments of Delaware and California and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of Metromile Insurance Company. Although the insurance carrier is currently commercially domiciled in California and therefore subject to certain provisions of the California Holding Company Act, this is not necessarily a permanent designation. The insurance carrier will remain commercially domiciled in California only for so long as during its three preceding fiscal years taken together it wrote an average of more direct premiums in California than it wrote in Delaware during the same period, and the California direct premiums written constitute 33 percent or more of its total direct premiums written everywhere in the U.S. for that three-year period. 
As the ultimate controlling person in our insurance holding company system, we are required to file an annual enterprise risk report pursuant to both the Delaware Holding Company Act and the California Holding Company Act. The report discloses, among other things, any material activities or developments that could adversely affect the insurance holding company system and/or the domestic insurance carrier specifically. In some states, any person divesting control of an insurer must provide thirty (30) days’ written notice to the regulator and the insurer. In addition, most states require insurance holding company systems to make annual corporate governance disclosures. 
Under the Delaware Holding Company Act and the California Holding Company Act, all inter-affiliate transactions within a holding company system must meet the following conditions: (i) the terms must be fair and reasonable; (ii) charges or fees for services performed must be fair and reasonable; and (iii) expenses incurred and payments received must be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied. The regulators in California and Delaware, respectively, often interpret these requirements differently, which can lead to delays in approval of affiliate agreements and unexpected terms or conditions. The insurance carrier generally must disclose any transaction between the insurance carrier and any other affiliate(s) to the insurance departments of Delaware and California and the insurance carrier must obtain prior approval from each such regulator before entering into certain material inter-affiliate transactions, including, but not limited to, management agreements, tax allocation agreements, service contracts, cost-sharing arrangements, extraordinary dividends, certain reinsurance transactions, and certain loan agreements. 
ORSA 
Pursuant to the ORSA Model Act, an insurance company with direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium of more than $500.0 million or that is part of an insurance group with direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium of more than $1.0 billion must maintain a risk management framework to assist the insurer with identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on its material and relevant risks. In addition, the insurer must regularly conduct an “own risk and solvency assessment” in accordance with NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. Upon the request of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance, and not more than once a year, any insurer subject to these requirements must submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and the insurance group of which it is a member. Metromile Insurance Company was exempt from these requirements in 2021 and 2020 since it had direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium of less than $500.0 million for that year, but at some point Metromile Insurance Company could become subject to the ORSA requirements. 
Restrictions on Paying Dividends 
We are a holding company that transacts a majority of its business through operating subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and meet our debt payment obligations depends on the results of operations of our operating subsidiaries and on the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, or otherwise. The payment of any extraordinary dividend by our regulated insurance subsidiary requires the prior approval (or no disapproval after thirty days’ notice) of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance and the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance. 
“Extraordinary dividend” is defined under the Delaware Insurance Code as any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (a) ten percent of Metromile Insurance Company’s surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year, or (b) Metromile Insurance Company’s net income for the twelve-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year, but does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurance company’s own securities. In addition, Metromile Insurance Company may not declare or pay a dividend or other distribution from any source other than earned surplus without the Delaware Commissioner’s prior approval. 
“Extraordinary dividend” is similarly defined under the California Insurance Code as any dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (a) ten percent of Metromile Insurance Company’s policyholder’s surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year, or (2) Metromile Insurance Company’s net income for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. 
As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, Metromile Insurance Company was not permitted to pay any dividends to its holding company parent without approval of the Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Insurance. See the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect our ability to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.” 
In addition, insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent a reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends of the maximum amount calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Delaware and/or California may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect. 
Reserves 
Metromile Insurance Company is required to hold admitted assets as reserves to cover projected losses under its policies, in accordance with actuarial principles. In accordance with the NAIC’s property and casualty statement instructions, Metromile Insurance Company must submit an annual Statement of Actuarial Opinion from a qualified actuary appointed by the company, certifying that its reserves are reasonable. The insurance departments of Delaware and California have the authority to dispute the reasonableness of the reserves certified by the actuary. 
Risk-Based Capital 
Metromile Insurance Company is required to maintain minimum levels of risk-based capital to support its overall business operations and minimize the risk of insolvency. State insurance regulators use risk-based capital to set capital requirements, based on the size and degree of risk taken by the insurer, taking into account various risk factors including asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk, and interest rate risk. As the ratio of an insurer’s total adjusted capital and surplus decreases relative to its risk-based capital, the risk-based capital laws provide for increasing levels of regulatory scrutiny and intervention. 
Delaware adopted the model legislation promulgated by the NAIC pertaining to risk-based capital, and requires annual reporting by Delaware-domiciled insurers to confirm that the insurer is meeting its risk-based capital requirements. Delaware-domiciled insurers falling below a risk-based capital threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. An insurance company with total adjusted capital that is less than 200% of its authorized control level risk-based capital is at a company action level, which would require the insurance company to file a risk-based capital plan that, among other things, contains proposals of corrective actions the company intends to take that are reasonably expected to result in the elimination of the company action level event. Additional action level events occur when the insurer’s total adjusted capital falls below 150%, 100% and 70% of its authorized control level risk-based capital. When total adjusted capital falls below 70%, a mandatory control event is triggered which results in the Delaware Department of Insurance placing the insurance company in receivership and assuming control of the operations of the insurer. As of December 31, 2021, Metromile Insurance Company’s risk-based capital levels are above all of these regulatory action level thresholds. As part of its regulatory review and approval of this transaction, the Delaware Department of Insurance required us to enter into a Capital Maintenance Agreement (the “CMA”). The CMA requires us to ensure that the regulated insurance subsidiary, Metromile Insurance Company, has and will maintain total adjusted capital in an amount equal to at least 300% of the insurance company’s authorized control level risk based capital from the close of the transaction until a date to be determined by the regulator in mid-2025. Being required to maintain capital levels above the statutory requirement could put constraints on our ability to deploy capital to which our competitors are not subject.
Hazardous Financial Conditions 
The Delaware Department of Insurance has the authority to deem Metromile Insurance Company to be in a hazardous financial condition such that the insurer’s continued operation may be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, or the general public. A finding of a hazardous condition can be based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) adverse findings in a financial, market conduct or other examination; (ii) failure to maintain adequate reserves in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards of practice; (iii) net loss or negative net income in the last twelve month period or any shorter period of time; (iv) failure to meet financial and holding company filing requirements; (v) insolvencies with a company’s reinsurer(s) or within the insurer’s insurance holding company system; (vi) a finding of incompetent or unfit management of the insurer; (vii) a failure to furnish requested information or provide accurate information in relation to a response to an inquiry or filing of a financial statement; and (viii) any other finding determined by the commissioner to be hazardous to the insurer’s policyholders, creditors or the general public. 
If the Delaware Department of Insurance finds Metromile Insurance Company to be in hazardous condition it has the authority, in lieu of placing the insurer into supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation, to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the insurer or issue an order to require the insurer to remedy the hazard. This would include, but is not limited to, ordering the insurer to: (i) increase its capital and surplus, (ii) suspend payment of dividends, (iii) limit or withdraw from certain investments, (iv) correct corporate governance deficiencies, and (v) take any other action necessary to cure the hazardous condition. 
Periodic Examinations 
Metromile Insurance Company is subject to on-site and remote or virtual visits and examinations by the state insurance regulatory authorities. Metromile Insurance Company is subject to market conduct examinations by insurance regulators, under which the regulator will examine its conduct towards policyholders including, but not limited to, complaint handling, marketing, claims, rate and form filing, nonrenewal and cancellation practices, and customer service. Metromile Insurance Company is also subject to a financial examination by the Delaware Department of Insurance every five years, under which it will review the company’s financials, including its relationships and transactions with affiliates. Metromile Insurance Company completed its first financial examination, covering the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017, by the Delaware Department of Insurance, which was accepted, adopted, and filed effective January 22, 2019, with “no significant findings or material adjustments to the Company’s financial statements” (the “2017 Examination”). In addition, the Delaware Department of Insurance may conduct special or targeted examinations to address particular concerns or issues at any time. Specifically, by memorandum dated December 3, 2018, the Delaware Department of Insurance identified several exceptions that were noted during the course of the 2017 Examination which were not deemed significant enough to be included in its January 22, 2019 report. As a follow-up to the memorandum, the Delaware Department of Insurance conducted two targeted examinations to which Metromile Insurance Company provided responses that were accepted by the regulator. The Delaware Department of Insurance is currently conducting Metromile Insurance Company's second financial examination covering the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. Insurance regulators of other states in which Metromile Insurance Company is licensed may also conduct examinations of the company, and such examinations have been completed by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and California (the California exam was limited to the Special Investigative Unit's compliance). Additionally, there are ongoing examinations by the California Department of Insurance and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The results of each examination can give rise to fines and monetary penalties as well as regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action.
Statutory Accounting Principles 
A licensed insurance carrier’s financial statements must be completed in accordance with statutory accounting principles, or SAP. SAP was developed by U.S. insurance regulators as a method of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer’s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to customers. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. 
Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles and related regulations differ somewhat from GAAP principles, which are designed to measure a business on a going-concern basis. GAAP gives consideration to matching of revenue and expenses and, as a result, certain expenses are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. Other assets such as goodwill are accounted for under GAAP financial statements but not SAP. As a result, the values for assets, liabilities, and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP may be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. 
Credit for Reinsurance 
As of December 31, 2021, Metromile Insurance Company commuted all reinsurance. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company signed an agreement under which it has ceded a portion of the risk it is insuring to various reinsurers. State insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the credit for reinsurance laws of the ceding insurer’s state of domicile. Once an insurance carrier has received credit for reinsurance it does not need to hold separate admitted assets as reserves to cover claims on the risks that it has ceded to the reinsurer. There are several different ways in which the credit for reinsurance laws may be satisfied by an assuming reinsurer, including being licensed in the state, being accredited in the state, or maintaining certain types of qualifying collateral. We ensure that all of Metromile Insurance Company’s reinsurers, and the related reinsurance and other agreements, qualify for credit for reinsurance so that Metromile Insurance Company is able to take full financial statement credit for its reinsurance. 
Rate Regulation 
Most states require personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In certain cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use. 
We currently have products on file and approved in the following states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. 
The speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it, and this process can often take multiple months. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority before being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Many states, including California, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. 
An insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs depends on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meet the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability. 
From time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. In particular, auto insurers have come under increasing pressure and in some states have been required to refund a portion of their premium to their policyholders due to decreasing auto claims arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether this pressure continues to exist depends on the persistence of COVID-19 generally, and on other political, social, and health issues that may arise. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict with precision the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates. 
In addition, insurers are restricted in their ability to use telematics-based data to set premium rates in California, Metromile’s largest market. Proposition 103, which was passed by referendum in 1988, limits the factors that insurers can use to set auto insurance rates to, in decreasing order of importance: (i) the insured’s driving safety record; (ii) the number of miles he or she drives annually; (iii) the number of years of driving experience the insured has had; and (iv) those other factors that the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance may adopt by regulation and that have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss. Under current California regulation, the use of telematics-based data beyond miles driven, including when, where or how the car is driven, is prohibited. In addition, other states in which Metromile operates, or may choose to operate in the future, similarly limit the use of telematics-based data beyond miles driven. Metromile Insurance Company is currently in discussions with the California Department of Insurance to revise its regulations to allow the use of telematics to a greater extent to underwrite and price insurance policies. Metromile cannot predict the outcome of these discussions, and there can be no assurance that the California Department of Insurance or other state regulators will revise regulations accordingly, if at all. 
Insolvency/Guaranty Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools, and Insurance Facilities 
Most states require admitted property and casualty insurance companies to become members of insolvency or guaranty funds or associations for impaired or insolvent insurance companies, which each state funds through an annual assessment on all insurance companies doing business in the state. These funds cover payments of claims of state policyholders whose admitted insurance carriers have become insolvent. The annual assessments required in any one year will vary from state to state, and are subject to various maximum assessments per line of insurance. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by any such assessments. 
In addition, most states require private passenger automobile insurers to participate in mandatory pools, insurance facilities, or similar markets of last resort. These pools allocate to all licensed auto insurers those drivers who are required by law to have automobile insurance but because of their risk profile cannot obtain coverage from the voluntary markets. Allocations are based on market share in each state. 
Investment Regulation 
Metromile Insurance Company is subject to Delaware’s rules and regulations governing the investment of its assets. Delaware’s laws generally require that an insurance company invest in a diverse portfolio, and limit its investments in certain asset categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in certain circumstances, Metromile Insurance Company would be required to dispose of those investments. 
Trade Practices 
Insurance companies and producers are subject to regulation on how they may sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance and conduct their business, with state laws prohibiting certain unfair trade practices. Such practices include, but are not limited to, false advertising, making false statements to regulators, unfair discrimination including against protected classes, and rebating premium to policyholders above certain de minimis amounts. Metromile and its affiliates set business conduct policies and provide training to ensure employee-agents and other customer service personnel are aware of these prohibitions and understand that they are required to conduct their activities in compliance with these laws. In addition, the NAIC and several states, including California, Connecticut, and New York, have indicated an increased desire and intent to examine scoring and other models used for rating and underwriting. We are not currently able to predict with precision what impact these laws, initiatives, or actions in this respect might have on our business. 
Unfair Claims Practices 
Insurance companies, third-party administrators, and individual claims adjusters are generally prohibited by state laws from engaging in unfair claims practices. Unfair claims practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions, failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies, failing to adopt reasonable standards for the investigation and settlement of a claim, and attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled. Metromile and its affiliates set business conduct policies to make claims adjusters aware of these prohibitions and to require them to conduct their activities in compliance with these laws. 
Commission Sharing 
Insurance producers cannot share insurance commissions with any person for selling, soliciting, or negotiating insurance unless such person holds an insurance producer license. There is a well-recognized, limited exception to this prohibition on commission sharing for the payment of referral fees to unlicensed persons, provided that the fee is a flat fee that is not contingent on the purchase of insurance and the referral does not involve the discussion of the terms or conditions of the policy. 
Data Privacy 
The use of non-public personal information in the insurance industry is subject to regulation under the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the NAIC Insurance Information and Privacy Act, to the extent adopted and implemented by the various state legislatures and insurance regulators, including through the California Financial Information Privacy Act. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, among other things, an insurance carrier or producer must disclose its privacy policies to all of its applicants and policyholders and must also provide either an opt-in or opt-out, depending on the state, to the sharing of non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties. 
We are also subject to the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020, and its implementing regulations which took effect in August 2020. The CCPA and related regulations give California residents the right to access and request deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed disclosures about how their personal information is used and shared. The CCPA exempts certain information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or the federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, which also apply to us. However, the definition of “personal information” in the CCPA is broad and encompasses other information that we process beyond the scope of these exemptions. In addition, on November 3, 2020, Californians approved Proposition 24, a ballot measure that created the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA will add new obligations on Metromile Insurance Company’s use, protection, and disclosures regarding personal information. We are not currently able to predict with precision what impact these laws and regulations might have on our business. 
Cybersecurity 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, insurance companies and producers must also establish a program of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the customers. 
Additionally, in response to the growing threat of cyber-attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions have begun to consider and adopt new cybersecurity regulations. On October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, intended to serve as model legislation for states to enact to govern cybersecurity and data protection practices of insurers, insurance agents, and other licensed entities registered under state insurance laws. Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Delaware, Indiana, South Carolina and Virginia, have adopted versions of the Insurance Data Security Model Law, each with a different effective date and some substantive differences. In addition, certain other states, including New York, have adopted their own cybersecurity laws with material differences from the NAIC Model Law. The CCPA also indirectly requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal information processed. Metromile Insurance Company takes steps to comply with financial industry cybersecurity regulations and believes it complies in all material respects with their requirements. Its board of directors oversees cybersecurity risk management and delegates oversight of its information security program to executive officers and a chief information security officer, who is responsible for the day-to-day management of our information security program and provides updates to the audit committee of the board of directors at each of its meetings. Metromile Insurance Company’s incident response team reports material information security incidents to executive officers, who in turn report them to the Board. 
Federal Regulation 
The regulation of insurance companies is principally a matter of state law, and the federal government does not directly regulate the transaction of insurance. However, federal statutes, regulations, and other initiatives do have an impact on the insurance industry. In particular, the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") was established within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) by the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010 to monitor and coordinate the regulation of the insurance industry across the United States. 
Although the FIO has limited direct regulatory authority over insurance companies or other insurance industry participants, it does represent the U.S. on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”). In addition, the FIO serves as an advisory member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, assists the secretary of the Treasury with administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, monitors trends in the insurance industry, and advises the secretary of the Treasury on important national and international insurance matters. The FIO has the ability to make a recommendation to the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate an insurer as “systemically significant,” subjecting the insurer to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, which could lead to higher capital requirements. 
In addition, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws, false advertising laws, anti-money laundering laws, the FCRA, and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program.
