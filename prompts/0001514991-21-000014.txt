OVERVIEW
AMC Networks is a global entertainment company known for its ground-breaking and award-winning original content. We own and operate a suite of focused and targeted video entertainment products that are delivered to viewers on an ever-expanding array of platforms. These include: our linear TV channels carried by traditional and virtual multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPD); our streaming services, consisting of AMC+ as well as our targeted streaming services; and various social media platforms.
We operate several of the most recognized brands in entertainment, creating and presenting high quality content and compelling stories to audiences, and a valuable platform for distributors and advertisers. We have operated in the entertainment industry for more than 40 years, and, over this time, we have continually enhanced the value of our portfolio. Our content spans multiple genres, including drama, comedy, documentary, reality, anthology, feature film and short form and is well known and well regarded by our key constituents — our viewers, distributors and advertisers — and have developed strong, dedicated followings within their respective targeted demographics, increasing their value to distributors and advertisers.
In the United States ("U.S."), our programming networks are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA (operated through a joint venture with BBC Studios), IFC and SundanceTV. Our deep and established presence in the industry and the recognition we have received for our brands through industry awards, critical acclaim and other honors lend us a high degree of credibility with content creators and producers, providing us with strong relationships with top creators and demand for our owned programming for distribution on third-party platforms. Our networks are distributed primarily through MVPDs and are available on every major U.S. distribution platform. Through our AMC Studios operation, we are increasingly owning our original programming. Today, through AMC Studios, we own and control a significant portion of the original scripted series that we deliver to viewers on our linear and streaming platforms.
Our ability to produce and own high quality content has provided us with the opportunity to distribute our owned content on platforms other than our domestic networks. Our owned content as well as the content that we license is distributed domestically and internationally and on multiple platforms, including linear television, company-owned and third-party streaming services, digital services, home video and syndication.
 We launched a premium subscription streaming bundle called AMC+ that includes commercial-free access to original programming from across our entertainment networks, library content including The Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead, The Walking Dead: World Beyond and Mad Men and access to a number of our targeted streaming services. AMC+ is currently available to customers through MVPDs and virtual MVPDs as well as Amazon, Apple and Roku. We also own and operate four targeted streaming services that offer curated content destinations that provide unique viewership experiences for distinct audiences. The four services are: Acorn TV, our largest streaming service, specializing in world-class mysteries and drama from Britain and beyond; Shudder, serving fans of horror and suspense; Sundance Now, featuring mysteries, prestige drama and true crime; and ALLBLK (previously known as Urban Movie Channel), the first streaming destination dedicated to Black audiences, featuring the best in Black TV and film.
While we primarily license content for these services, we continue to increasingly invest in producing original programming, which is contributing to strong growth and a stable user base.
Internationally, we deliver programming that reaches subscribers in more than 125 countries and territories around the world. The international division of the Company, AMC Networks International ("AMCNI"), consists of global brands, including AMC and SundanceTV, in the movie and entertainment programming genres, as well as popular, locally recognized channels in several other programming genres.
AMC Networks also operates IFC Films, a film distribution business that distributes independent narrative and documentary films under the IFC Films label as well as the IFC Midnight distribution label. IFC Films is known for attracting high-profile talent and distributing films that regularly garner critical acclaim and industry honors, including numerous Oscar, Golden Globe, and Cannes Film Festival-award winning titles. IFC Films also operates IFC Films Unlimited, a subscription video on demand streaming channel comprised of theatrically-released and award-winning titles from its distribution labels. IFC Films has been behind some of the most culturally impactful and successful independent film and documentary releases of all time, and IFC Films Unlimited includes a broad range of titles.
Strategy
Our strategy is to maintain and improve our position as a leading entertainment company by creating and presenting content that is high-quality, brand defining and compelling to watch, and by owning and operating some of the most popular and award-winning brands in television that create engagement with audiences globally across multiple distribution platforms. The key focuses of our strategy are:
Continued Development of High-Quality Original Programming. We intend to continue developing strong original programming across all of our programming networks to further enhance our brands, strengthen our relationships with our viewers, distributors and advertisers, and increase distribution and audience ratings. We intend to seek increased distribution of our national networks to grow distribution and advertising revenues. We believe that our continued investment in original programming will support future growth in distribution and advertising revenue. We also intend to continue to expand the exploitation of our original programming across multiple distribution platforms.
Increased Ownership and Control of Content and Valuable IP. We believe that control (including long-term contractual arrangements) and ownership of content is important. Through our AMC Studios operation, we intend to increase our control over more of our programming content. We currently control, own or have long-term license agreements covering significant portions of our content across our programming networks, our streaming services, and our independent film distribution business operated by IFC Films. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining the broadest possible control rights (both as to territory and platforms) for our content. 
Develop and Grow Targeted Streaming Offerings and Brands. We have been focused on creating and growing targeted streaming services for several years. As the market for this category evolves, consumers are increasingly complementing their general entertainment subscriptions with our targeted streaming services. Our targeted streaming strategy is to serve distinct premium audiences and build loyal and engaged fan communities around each service. 
Innovation in Content, Format, Distribution, and New Products. The technological landscape of the distribution of entertainment content has expanded to include other media platforms. We distribute our content across many of these platforms, when it makes business sense to do so, so that our viewers can access our content where, when and how they want it. To that end, our programming networks are allowing many of our distributors to offer our content to subscribers on various platforms permitting subscribers to access programs at their convenience. We also make select content available on streaming services or digital platform providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats. 
Growth and Innovation in Advertising. We continue to evolve the programming on each of our networks to achieve even stronger viewer engagement within their respective core targeted demographics, thereby increasing the value of our programming to advertisers and allowing us to obtain higher advertising rates. 
We are also creating new opportunities for brands to leverage the strength of our content and our large and passionate fan communities on social platforms as well as through on-the-ground live events. These opportunities are rooted in our strong content and proven ability to build vibrant, large and engaged fan communities around our shows and franchises.
In addition, we are embracing many new opportunities the evolving advertising space presents, including the potential of advertising video on demand (AVOD). To date, we have launched a total of seven distinct channels featuring our content, in different configurations, across major AVOD platforms, such as Pluto TV and Sling TV. We have made significant investments in advanced advertising technologies such as our proprietary targeting tool called Aurora. In what has been a multi-year effort for us, we have been building tools and staffing up as we develop data and analytics for our proprietary tools. We have seen the number of advertisers utilizing these tools increase and our targeted audience ad sales have grown as a result. In addition to our own initiatives, we are also participating in broader industry efforts, such as Project OAR, a consortium focused on bringing addressable advertising to smart TVs. We believe our products enhance our value to advertisers through better targeting, data and measurement and we believe they will improve our overall business in the mid and long term.
Increased Global Distribution. We distribute our programming networks around the globe. We first expanded beyond the U.S. market with the launch in Canada of IFC (in 2001) and AMC (in 2006), and in Europe of SundanceTV (in 2010) and AMC (in 2014). One or more of AMC Networks International's channels are available in more than 125 countries and territories worldwide.
Revenue
We earn revenue principally from the distribution of our programming and the sale of advertising. Distribution revenues primarily include fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks, revenue earned from the licensing of original programming and subscription fees paid for our streaming services. In 2020, distribution revenues and advertising sales accounted for 69% and 31% of our consolidated revenues, net, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues, net.
Distribution Revenue
Subscription revenue: Our programming networks are distributed to our viewing audience throughout the U.S. and around the world via cable and other multichannel video programming distribution platforms, including direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), platforms operated by telecommunications providers and virtual MVPDs (collectively "distributors") pursuant to agreements with the distributors. Our subscription fee revenues are based on a per subscriber fee, and, to a lesser extent, fixed fees under multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as "affiliation agreements," which generally provide for annual rate increases. The specific subscription fee revenues we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our networks, but are generally based upon the number of each distributor's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers. These agreements also give us the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programming networks. Our programming networks' existing distribution agreements expire at various dates through 2028. For our AMC Networks Streaming Services, we earn monthly fees as the streaming service is provided to our customers.
We frequently negotiate with distributors in an effort to increase the subscriber base for our networks. We have in some instances made upfront payments to distributors in exchange for these additional subscribers. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our programming networks or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by such deferred carriage fee arrangements, discounted subscriber fees and other payments, however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.
Content licensing revenue: We sell rights to our owned original programming and content acquired under long-term distribution arrangements for distribution in a variety of forms including television markets worldwide, streaming services or digital platform providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats.
Advertising Revenue
We earn advertising revenue by selling advertising time on our programming networks, on digital platforms we own and also on an increasing number of AVOD platforms. In the U.S., we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season, and by purchasing in advance, often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run, and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Internationally, advertising markets vary by jurisdiction. The majority of international advertising is sold close to the time when the commercials will be run (similar to the U.S. scatter market) and we are generally represented by third-party sales agents.
Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. In most domestic advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. If these guaranteed viewer ratings are not met, we are generally required to provide additional advertising units to the advertiser at no charge. For these types of arrangements, a portion of the related revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when we provide the required additional advertising unit or the guarantee obligation contractually expires. In the U.S., most of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. In addition to the Nielsen rating, our advertising rates are also influenced by the demographic mix of our viewing audiences, since advertisers tend to pay premium rates for more desirable demographic groups of viewers.
Our programming networks have advertisers representing companies in a broad range of sectors, including automotive, restaurants/food, health, and telecommunications industries. 
Programming
We obtain programming through a combination of development, production and licensing; and we distribute programming directly to consumers in the U.S. and throughout the world through our programming networks, streaming services, and other forms of distribution and theatrical release of our IFC Films acquired content. Our programming includes original programming that we control, either through outright ownership or through long-term licensing arrangements, as well as acquired programming that we license from studios and other rights holders. Since the founding of our first channel in 1980, 
we have been a pioneer in the cable television programming industry, having created or developed some of the industry's leading programming networks, with a focus on programming of film and original productions. Certain of our programming networks feature original programming that includes critically-acclaimed original scripted dramatic series. 
Original Programming
Through our AMC Studios operation, we increasingly produce and own more of our original programming, primarily for our programming networks and streaming services, and also for license to third parties worldwide. Decisions as to how to distribute programming are made on the basis of a variety of factors including the relative value of any particular alternative.
We also contract with some of the industry's leading production companies to produce original programming that appears on our programming networks and streaming services. These contractual arrangements either provide us with outright ownership of the programming, in which case we hold all programming and other rights to the content, or they consist of long-term licensing arrangements, which provide us with exclusive rights to exhibit the content on our programming networks, but may be limited in terms of specific geographic markets or distribution platforms. The license agreements are typically of multi-season duration and provide us with a right of first negotiation or a right of first refusal on the renewal of the license for additional programming seasons. 
Acquired Programming
The majority of the content on our programming networks and streaming services consists of films, episodic series and specials that we acquire pursuant to rights agreements with film studios, production companies or other rights holders. This acquired programming includes episodic series such as Law and Order, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, Two and a Half Men and Batman, as well as an extensive film library. The rights agreements for this content are of varying duration and generally permit our programming networks and streaming services to carry these series, films and other programming during certain window periods.

We manage our business through the following two operating segments:
•National Networks: Includes activities of our five national programming networks, AMC Studios operations and AMC Broadcasting & Technology. Our national programming networks are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC, and SundanceTV.

REGULATION
Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. The Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") regulates U.S. programming networks directly in some respects; other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change and increasingly, legislative and regulatory proposals seek to cover all sources of content, including the digital platforms over which we offer content, which may affect our regulatory burdens in the future. The descriptions below are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Closed Captioning
Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, and we must provide closed captioning on certain video content that we offer on the Internet or through other Internet Protocol distribution methods.
CALM Act
FCC rules require MVPDs to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our distribution agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Obscenity Restrictions
Cable operators and other MVPDs are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.
Program Carriage
The FCC recently made changes to the program carriage rules, which prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated programming networks over unaffiliated similarly situated programming networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between programming networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Some of these changes could make it more difficult for our programming networks to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our programming networks or a distributor action mid-contract that discriminates against one of our programming networks.
Packaging Programming and Volume Discounts
The FCC from time to time examines whether to adopt rules restricting how programmers package and price their networks, or whether to impose other restrictions on carriage agreements between programmers and MVPDs. We do not currently require distributors to carry more than one of our national programming networks in order to obtain the right to carry a particular national programming network. However, we generally negotiate with a distributor for the carriage of all of our national networks concurrently, and we offer volume discounts to distributors who make our programming available to larger numbers of subscribers or who carry more of our programming networks.
Some states also have sought to regulate the manner in which MVPDs package and offer programming. We generally do not allow our networks or individual programs on those networks today to be offered by distributors on an a la carte basis.
Effect of "Must-Carry" and "Retransmission Consent" Requirements
The FCC's implementation of the statutory "must-carry" obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give certain broadcasters preferential access to channel space, and FCC "retransmission consent" rules allow broadcasters to require cable and DBS operators to carry broadcast-affiliated networks as a condition of access to the local broadcast station and to charge substantial fees for both carriage of the local broadcast station and the broadcast-affiliated networks. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems. These carriage laws may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS 
operators, or the amount of programming funds that cable and DBS operators have available for carriage of our networks.
Website Requirements
We maintain various websites that provide information regarding our businesses and offer content for sale. The operation of these websites may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, data security, accessibility, child safety and consumer protection regulations. For example, most states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations, and new frameworks regulating consumer privacy have recently been established at the state level and overseas, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The GDPR and the CCPA impose, among other things, more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, and increased liability for violations.
Other Regulation
The FCC also imposes rules that may impact us regarding a variety of issues such as advertising in children's television, and telemarketing. Programming businesses are subject to regulation by the country in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. These regulations may include restrictions on types of advertising that can be sold on our networks, programming content requirements, requirements to make programming available on non-discriminatory terms, and local content quotas.
COMPETITION
Our programming services, consisting of linear networks and streaming services, operate in three highly competitive markets. First, our programming services compete with other programming services to obtain distribution on cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distribution systems, and ultimately for viewing by each distributor's subscribers. Second, our programming services compete with other programming services and other sources of video content, to secure desired entertainment programming. Third, our programming services compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other cable programming networks, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and, increasingly, internet sites. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming services that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do.
Distribution of Programming Networks
The business of distributing programming networks to cable television systems and other MVPDs and licensing of original programming for distribution is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks for carriage by a particular MVPD, and for the carriage on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once our programming network is selected by a distributor for carriage, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available on the distributor's system, but also with over-the-air broadcast television, Internet-based video and other online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, and other sources of information and entertainment.
Important to our success in each area of competition we face are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality and variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our networks' marketing efforts. The competition for viewers among advertiser supported networks is directly correlated with the competition for advertising revenues with each of our competitors.
Our ability to successfully compete with other networks may be hampered because the cable television systems or other MVPDs through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with other programming networks. In addition, because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming networks to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased distribution and advertising revenue for such programming networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming networks, such distributors may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.
New or existing programming networks that are affiliated with broadcasting networks like ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC may also have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the "bundling" of agreements to carry those programming networks with agreements giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station affiliated with the broadcasting network. 
Part of our strategy involves exploiting identified segments of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size. Our networks have faced and will continue to face increasing competition as other programming networks and online or other services seek to serve the same or similar niches.
We also seek to increase our content licensing revenues by expanding the opportunities for licensing our programming through other media platforms and we compete with other programming companies in this market based on the desirability of our programming.
Sources of Programming
We also compete with other programming networks and other distributors including digital distribution platforms to secure desired programming. Most of our original programming and all of our acquired programming is obtained through agreements with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such programming. Competition for this programming will increase as the number of programming networks and other distributors increases. Other programming networks or streaming services that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.
With respect to the acquisition of entertainment programming, such as syndicated programs and movies that are not produced by or specifically for networks, our competitors include national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, other cable programming networks, Internet-based video content distributors, and video-on-demand programs. Some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries.
Competition for Advertising Revenue
Our programming networks must compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other MVPDs, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and increasing shifts in spending toward online and mobile offerings from more traditional media. We compete for advertisers on the basis of rates we charge and also on the number and demographic nature of viewers who watch our programming. Advertisers will often seek to target their advertising content to those demographic categories they consider most likely to purchase the product or service they advertise. Accordingly, the demographic make-up of our viewership can be equally or more important than the number of viewers watching our programming.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
At AMC Networks, our business is driven by telling original stories that entertain with vivid characters and worlds, that capture the imagination, and endure. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital management objectives are to invest in and support our employees so that we have the ability to attract, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our vision is to be an industry leader that thinks, operates and creates using diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as a necessary lever for change and business results.
Our commitment to DEI at work ensures our success in all areas of our business. In 2020 we appointed our first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer who reports to our CEO and is dedicated to helping us build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture in our workplace and in the stories we tell. 
As part of our DEI efforts, the Company places a high value on engaging the organization in our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) around the globe. The Company has ERGs across nine categories, including Asian American, Visible & Invisible Disabilities, Emerging Leaders, Parents & Caregivers, LGBTQIA+, Black, Hispanic and Women. We believe the ERGs help facilitate networking and connections with peers, support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally, act as a sounding board for content development and programming, provide an avenue to facilitate leadership and skill development and increase the organization’s overall cultural competency.
Talent
The Company employed 2,002 full-time employees and 355 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020. Our global workforce is over 50% women, with 44% of our senior leadership positions held by women. Over 27% of our U.S.-based workforce are people of color.
We aim to attract top talent through our corporate brand and our reputation for innovation and high quality content, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards; offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally; and our commitment to fostering a positive corporate culture.
Our performance management practice includes frequent feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include: a robust internal mentorship program; dynamic 
teams that take a cross disciplinary approach to driving innovation and problem solving; leadership development programs; and tuition assistance. 
Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the range of needs of our diverse workforce and include: adoption assistance; backup child/elder care; child care resources; college planning; domestic partner coverage; domestic partner tax equalization; employee assistance program; financial planning seminars; and a health advocate offering. These resources are intended to support the health, finance, and well-being of our employees.
In addition, for certain of our productions, the Company, through in-house and third party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, actors and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Since these agreements are generally entered into on a per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year. We believe that our relations with the labor unions and our employees are generally good.
Engagement
We believe having an engaged workforce is key to employee retention and satisfaction. Communication is central to our engagement efforts and include monthly CEO-hosted Virtual Town Halls; ERG panels and events; a Talks@AMC Networks speaker series featuring notable business and creative leaders from across our industry; regular internal company communications about business developments and other company news; company intranet; and an annual all staff company-wide meeting. 
We aim to give our employees a voice in a variety of ways, including through formal engagement surveys, which solicit feedback on a range of topics such as company direction and strategy, leadership and management transparency, and diversity and inclusion.
Culture
Our Company has a proud past and a long history of innovation and originality in our storytelling. This legacy informs who we are and is imbued in our corporate culture and in our values. We embrace collaboration, openness, approachability, as well as agility and creativity. 
We strive to empower our employees to have community and social impact in meaningful ways. In 2020, we instituted two employee-led giving programs – a COVID-19 relief fund and a Social Justice fund. We asked employees to identify charitable organizations focused on COVID-19 related relief efforts and racial inequality, with each employee identified organization receiving a $1,000 donation from the Company. 
Other initiatives to foster community and social impact include paid time off for full-time employees for Juneteenth, Election Day and a volunteer day of their choice.
