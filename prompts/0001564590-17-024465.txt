For more information regarding domestic and foreign revenue and revenue by our business units, also known as our operating segments, for each of our last three fiscal years, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion of other aspects of our business including research and development (“R&D”), intellectual property, marketing and sales, future acquisition strategy, significant customers, competition, manufacturing, government regulation and our employees applies to our business in general and we describe material segment information within these sections where relevant.
 Medical Device Segment
 Advances in medical device technology have helped drive improved device efficacy and patient outcomes. The convergence of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries, often made possible by surface coatings and device drug delivery technologies, (together, “surface modification coating technologies”) presents an opportunity for major advancements in the healthcare industry. We believe the benefits of combining drugs and biologics with implantable and minimally invasive devices are becoming increasingly valuable in applications in cardiology, peripheral vascular disease, ophthalmology, orthopedics and other large markets. 
 In an effort to improve their existing products or develop entirely new devices, a growing number of medical device manufacturers are exploring or using surface modification and device drug delivery technologies as product differentiators or device enablers. The continuing trend toward minimally invasive surgical procedures, which often employ catheter-based delivery technologies, has increased the demand for hydrophilic (i.e., lubricious or slippery) coatings and other coating technologies. For example, stents, particularly drug-eluting stents, have significantly reduced the need for repeat intravascular procedures, and they have diminished the need for more invasive cardiac bypass surgery. Drug-coated balloons have further transformed intravascular therapies by enhancing patient outcomes while not leaving stents in the vascular system. Transcatheter heart valve repair or replacement via a minimally invasive catheter-based system has enabled the treatment of patients suffering from heart valve disease who are too ill to undergo open-heart surgery. Positive clinical outcomes and acceptance of these and other similar innovations by patients, physicians and insurance companies has helped certain segments of the United States (“U.S.”) medical device industry grow at a faster pace than the economy as a whole. The attractiveness of the industry has drawn intense competition among the companies participating in this area. 
 Our Medical Device segment provides surface modification coating technologies that impart lubricity, prohealing or biocompatibility characteristics, or drug delivery capabilities, as well as vascular device, catheter and balloon design, development and manufacturing capabilities. Historically, we have provided surface modification technologies to enhance our customers’ medical devices and delivery systems. Since fiscal 2013, with our investment in our drug-coated balloon (“DCB”) platform, we have been focused on a strategy to develop and manufacture proprietary medical device products that combine our surface modification 
 3

coatings with medical devices or delivery systems (“whole-product solutions”). This strategy does not change our focus on our core surface modification technologies, however we believe it will greatly increase our relevance in the industry and is key to our future growth and profitability, given the prospect of capturing more revenue and operating margin with whole-product solutions. Our aim is to provide customers earlier access to highly differentiated whole-product solutions that address unmet clinical needs, and partner with them on successful commercialization. 
 During fiscal 2017, we continued investing in our whole-product solutions strategy and achieved meaningful strategic milestones, including the initiation of the TRANSCEND SurVeil® DCB pivotal clinical trial, as well as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Conformité Européenne (“CE Mark”) clearance for our .014” low-profile percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon dilation catheter (“.014” PTA balloon catheter”), designed for peripheral angioplasty procedures. 
 Overview of Interventional Peripheral Market and Whole-Products Solutions Strategy
 Peripheral artery disease (“PAD”) is a condition that causes a narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the extremities, most often due to plaque buildup in the arterial walls. Left untreated, PAD may lead to symptoms such as large non-healing ulcers, infections, or gangrene, and may require limb amputation or, in extreme cases, result in death. 
 The American Heart Association has reported that an estimated 8.5 million Americans and 202 million people worldwide are living with PAD. The number of people affected by PAD is expected to increase as a result of an aging population, coupled with increasing prevalence of conditions linked to PAD, such as diabetes and obesity. The interventional PAD market utilizes a variety of access and therapy catheters to treat PAD.  These technologies are delivered through a number of access points into the vascular system including femoral (leg), radial (wrist or arm) and pedal (foot).
 Our business model for our whole-product solutions strategy is to design, develop and manufacture products incorporating our proprietary catheter, balloon and surface modification coating technologies. Our whole-product solutions strategy has been built on the acquisition of state-of-the-art medical device design, development and manufacturing capabilities to complement our leadership in surface modification coating technologies to develop whole-product solutions for treatment of PAD and other vascular diseases.  The Creagh Medical acquisition brought a state-of-the-art R&D and manufacturing facility offering robust extrusion, balloon-forming, top-assembly, packaging and regulatory capabilities focused on balloon catheters. The NorMedix acquisition provided ultra-thin-walled, minimally invasive catheter technologies. We have integrated our balloon catheter, ultra-thin-walled catheter and surface modification technologies to design, develop and manufacture proprietary products.  We are currently seeking third-party companies to distribute our products to end users.
 During fiscal 2017 we received FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Mark for our first whole-product solution, a .014” PTA balloon catheter, and expect to receive regulatory approval for several additional catheter and balloon-based products throughout calendar 2018.  We are currently in discussions with potential partners to distribute our .014” PTA balloon catheter.
 Surmodics is focused on the development of drug coated balloons to treat PAD. The development of the SurVeil DCB is a major step forward in our strategy to offer whole-product solutions for the medical device industry. During fiscal 2016, we initiated PREVEIL, an early feasibility clinical trial of the SurVeil DCB, which is intended to treat PAD in the leg above the knee. Enrollment in PREVEIL was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We began enrollment in the TRANSCEND SurVeil DCB pivotal clinical study in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, with the objective of obtaining data necessary to support regulatory approvals and reimbursement for this device in the U.S. We also plan to initiate SurVeil DCB clinical trials in Europe to support CE Mark approval. Until regulatory approvals have been obtained, our SurVeil DCB is not approved for commercial sale.
 In addition to our SurVeil DCB program, we are developing other DCB’s for treatment of PAD below-the-knee (“BTK”) and arteriovenous (“AV”) fistulae, commonly associated with hemodialysis.
 Overview of Surmodics’ Surface Modification and Device Drug Delivery Technologies
 We believe Surmodics is positioned to take advantage of the continuing trend of incorporating surface modification and device drug delivery technologies into the design of combination products, potentially leading to more efficient and effective products as well as new product applications. We have a growing proprietary technology portfolio that incorporates our market expertise and insight, as well as unique collaborative research, development and manufacturing capabilities — key ingredients to bring innovation together to benefit patients, us, and the healthcare industry.

Coatings for Surface Modification and Device Drug Delivery
 Key differentiating characteristics of our coating platforms are their flexibility, durability and ease of use. In terms of flexibility, coatings can be applied to many different kinds of surfaces and can immobilize a variety of chemical, pharmaceutical and biological agents. Additionally, the surface modification process can be tailored to provide customers with the ability to improve their devices’ performance by choosing the specific coating properties desired for particular applications. Our surface modification technologies also can be combined to deliver multiple surface-enhancing characteristics on the same device.
 Our proprietary PhotoLink® coating technology is a versatile, easily applied, coating technology that modifies medical device surfaces by creating covalent bonds between device surfaces and a variety of chemical agents. PhotoLink coatings can impart many performance enhancing characteristics, such as advanced lubricity (slippery) and hemocompatibility (preventing blood clot formation), when bound onto surfaces of medical devices or other biological materials without materially changing the dimensions or other physical properties of devices. 
 PhotoLink reagents can be applied to a variety of substrates. The coating formulations are easily applied to the material surface by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, dipping, spraying, roll-coating or ink-jetting. We continue to expand our proprietary reagent portfolio for use by our customers. These reagents enable our customers to develop novel surface features for their devices, satisfying the expanding healthcare industry requirements. We are also continually working to expand the list of materials that are compatible with our surface modification and device drug delivery reagents. Additionally, we develop coating processes and coating equipment to meet the device quality, manufacturing throughput and cost requirements of our customers.
 The PhotoLink coating process is relatively simple to use and is easily integrated into the customer’s manufacturing process. In addition, the process does not subject the coated products to harsh chemical or temperature conditions, produces no hazardous byproducts, and does not require lengthy processing or curing time. Further, our PhotoLink coatings are generally compatible with accepted sterilization processes, so the surface attributes are not lost when the medical device is sterilized.
 We launched our Serene® hydrophilic coating platform in fiscal 2013, which optimizes lubricity and durability while significantly reducing particulates generation. This next-generation coating has demonstrated excellent lubricity on a wide range of substrates, and has been used on FDA-cleared coronary, peripheral and structural heart devices. Serene coatings are applied using our PhotoLink process.
 Our device drug delivery coating technologies allow therapeutic drugs to be incorporated within our proprietary polymer matrices to provide controlled, site-specific release of the drug into the surrounding environment. The drug release can be tuned to elute quickly (within minutes to a few days) or slowly (from several months to over a year), illustrating the wide range of release profiles that can be achieved with our coating systems. On a wide range of devices, drug-eluting coatings can help improve device performance, increase patient safety and enable innovative new treatments. Examples of short term use drug delivery devices would include drug coated balloons and examples of longer-term drug delivery devices would include drug eluting stents. We work with companies in the medical device and biotechnology industries to develop specialized coatings that allow for the controlled release of drugs from device surfaces. We see at least three primary areas with strong future potential: (1) improving the function of a device which itself is necessary to treat the medical condition; (2) enabling site-specific drug delivery while limiting systemic exposure; and (3) enhancing the biocompatibility of a medical device to ensure that it continues to function over a long period of time.
 Licensing Arrangements
 We commercialize our surface modification and device drug delivery technologies primarily through licensing arrangements with medical device manufacturers. We believe this approach allows us to focus our resources on further developing new technologies and expanding our licensing activities. Many of our technologies have been designed to allow manufacturers to implement them easily into their own manufacturing processes so customers can control production and quality internally without the need to send their products to a contract manufacturer. 
 We generate the largest portion of our revenue through licensing arrangements. Royalties and license fees represented 43.5%, 46.5% and 51.3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Greater than 96% of our royalties and license fees revenue in this three-year period were generated from hydrophilic coating licenses. Revenue from these licensing arrangements typically includes license fees and milestone payments, minimum royalties, and royalties based on a percentage of licensees’ product sales. We also generate revenue from reagent chemical sales to licensees for use in their coating processes.
 5

The licensing process begins with the customer specifying a desired product feature to be created such as lubricity or drug delivery. Because each device and coating application is unique, we routinely conduct a feasibility study to qualify each new potential product application, often generating commercial development revenue. Feasibility studies can range in duration from several months to a year. After we complete a feasibility study, our customers cannot market their product until they receive regulatory approval.  As further described under the caption “Government Regulation,” the regulatory approval process varies in each country and ranges from several months to four or more years. At any time prior to a customer’s commercial launch, a license agreement may be executed granting the licensee rights to use our technology. We often support our customers by providing coating assistance for parts required in animal tests and human clinical trials. Typically, we complete a technology transfer to most customers which enables those customers to apply the coating at their own facilities.
 License agreement terms are generally for a specified number of years or our patent’s life, whichever is longer, although a license generally may be terminated by the licensee for any reason upon 90 days’ advance written notice. In cases where the royalty obligation extends beyond the life of the applicable patent, it is because the license also includes rights to our know-how or other proprietary rights. Under these circumstances, the royalty obligation typically continues at a reduced royalty rate for a specified number of years generally following the date on which the customer’s product was first sold. 
 Our license agreements may include certain license fees and/or milestone payments. Substantially all our licensed applications are nonexclusive, allowing us to license technology to multiple customers. Moreover, even exclusive licenses generally are limited to a specific “field of use,” allowing us the opportunity to further license technology to other customers. The royalty rate on a substantial number of the agreements has traditionally been in the 2% to 3% range, but there are certain contracts with lower or higher rates. In certain agreements, our royalty is based on an agreed-upon amount per unit. License fees, milestone payments, and the royalty rates are based on various factors, including the licensed product’s or technology’s stage of development, the perceived value of our technology to the customer’s product, the size of the potential market, and whether the arrangement is exclusive or nonexclusive. Our agreements generally incorporate a minimum royalty to be paid by the licensee. Royalty payments generally commence one quarter after the customer’s actual product sales occur because of the delay in reporting sales by our licensees. As such, we currently recognize royalty revenue in the quarter customer royalty payments are due to us.  Commencing in fiscal 2019 we are required to adopt a new revenue recognition accounting standard that will require us to recognize and accrue royalty revenue in the same quarter that the underlying customer product sale occurs.
 We have over 150 licensed product classes (customer products utilizing Surmodics technology) already in the market generating royalties and greater than 100 customer product classes incorporating our technology in various stages of pre-commercialization. We signed 17, 18 and 22 new licenses in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Under our customer license agreements, the responsibility for securing regulatory approval for and ultimately commercializing these products rests with our customers. Our reliance on our customers in this regard and the potential risks to our operations as a result are discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Moreover, we are often contractually obligated to keep the details concerning our customers’ R&D efforts (including the timing of expected regulatory filings, approvals and market introductions) confidential. Given the significant uncertainty inherent in product development and regulatory approval processes, the expected timing for regulatory approval and commercialization for the product classes pending regulatory approval is can vary greatly.
 Our licensing agreements generally require us to keep our customers’ identities confidential, unless they approve of such disclosure. Licensed customers who allow the use of their name include: Abbott Laboratories (“Abbott”), Boston Scientific Corporation (“Boston Scientific”), Cook Medical, Cordis Corporation (a subsidiary of Cardinal Health, Inc.) (“Cordis”), Covidien PLC (a subsidiary of Medtronic), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Evalve, Inc. (a subsidiary of Abbott), ev3 Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic), Medtronic, OrbusNeich Medical, Inc., and Spectranetics Corporation (a subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips N.V.). 
 In Vitro Diagnostics Segment
 Our In Vitro Diagnostics (“IVD”) business unit sells stabilization products, substrates, antigens and surface coatings to diagnostics customers. We manufacture or sell components for in vitro diagnostic immunoassay and molecular tests and we manufacture and sell surface coatings to the diagnostic, biomedical research, and life science markets.
 Immunoassay Diagnostics. An immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a target molecule, or “analyte”, in a biological fluid or sample. Analyte levels are correlated to the patient’s disease state or medical condition of a patient to diagnose the presence, absence or severity of disease. Analytes can range from large molecules such as proteins to small molecules such as hormones.  Immunoassays are developed and produced using multiple components. The component’s selection and optimization confer the assay quality and performance of the assay in terms of sensitivity and 
 6

specificity. IVD companies select these critical biochemical and reagent components to meet the assay’s diagnostic specifications. We develop, manufacture and sell high-performing, consistent-quality and stable immunoassay component products to enable our customers’ diagnostic tests to detect the absence or presence of disease.
 Molecular Diagnostics - DNA and Protein Immobilization. Both DNA and protein microarrays are useful tools for the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and research industries. During a DNA gene analysis, typically thousands of different probes need to be placed in a pattern on a surface, called a DNA microarray. These microarrays are used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for new drugs, by genome mappers to sequence human, animal or plant genomes, or by diagnostic companies to search a patient sample for disease causing bacteria or viruses. However, DNA does not readily adhere to most surfaces. We have developed various surface chemistries for both DNA and protein immobilization. Protein microarrays are used as diagnostic and research tools to determine the presence and/or quantity of proteins in a biological sample. The most common type of protein microarray is the antibody microarray, where antibodies are spotted onto a surface and used as capture molecules for protein detection.
 The sales cycle for our IVD products generally begins when an IVD company initiates the process to develop a new, or improve a current, diagnostic test. During product development, these companies will look to source the test’s critical components with reagents it produces internally or with reagents from a supplier, such as Surmodics.
 As IVD tests are developed and various reagents are tested, companies will generally seek to optimize the sensitivity (false negative reductions), specificity (false positive reductions), speed (time from sample to results), convenience (ideally as few steps as possible) and cost effectiveness. Upon regulatory approval or clearance, the customer’s diagnostic test can be sold in the marketplace. It may take several years after approval or clearance for the test to achieve peak market share and optimize Surmodics’ revenue.
 Overview of In Vitro Diagnostics Products
 Protein Stabilizers. We offer a full line of stabilization products for the IVD market. These products increase sensitivity, reduce false positive and false negative results, while extending the diagnostic test’s shelf life, thereby producing more consistent assay results. Our stabilization products are ready-to-use, eliminating the in-house manufacturing preparation time and cost of producing stabilization and blocking reagents.
 Substrates. We also provide colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates to the IVD market under our BioFX trademark. A substrate is the diagnostic test kit component that detects and signals that a reaction has taken place so that a result can be recorded. Colorimetric substrates signal a positive diagnostic result through a color change. Chemiluminescent substrates signal a positive diagnostic result by emitting light. We believe that our substrates offer a high level of stability, sensitivity and consistency.
 Antigens. We are the exclusive distributor in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico (and non-exclusive distributor in Japan) of DIARECT AG’s line of antigens. Because of the lack of high-quality antigens from natural sources, DIARECT produces the majority of these antigens and other components using recombinant technology.
 Surface Coatings for Molecular Diagnostic Applications. We offer custom coatings for molecular diagnostic applications, including DNA, RNA and protein microarrays. Our TRIDIA™ surface coatings bind molecules to a variety of surfaces and geometries and may be customized for selectivity using passivating polymers and reactive groups. This proprietary technology immobilizes DNA and protein to adhere to testing surfaces. We offer other surface coatings that improve flow characteristics through membranes and microfluidic channels on diagnostic devices including point-of-care components.
Research and Development
 Our R&D personnel work to enhance and expand our technology and product offerings in the area of whole-product solutions, drug delivery, surface modification, and in vitro diagnostics through internal scientific investigation and proprietary product development. These scientists and engineers also evaluate external technologies in support of our corporate development activities. Our R&D efforts are all guided by the needs of the markets in which we do business. Additionally, the R&D staff support the business development staff and business units in performing feasibility studies, providing technical assistance to existing and potential customers. These services, which generate our research, development and other revenue, include optimizing the relevant technologies for specific customer applications, supporting clinical trials, training customers, and integrating our technologies and know-how into customer manufacturing operations and developing whole-product solutions that meet customers’ needs by integrating our coating, medical device and medical device delivery technologies.

In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our R&D expenses were $31.8 million, $18.5 million and $16.2 million, respectively. Included in R&D expenses are the costs associated with our research, development and other revenue. We intend to continue significantly investing in R&D to advance our whole-product solutions, surface modification coatings, device drug delivery and in vitro diagnostic technologies and to expand uses for our technology platforms. We anticipate an increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2018 primarily related to whole-product solutions product development, including our DCB development and clinical study activities. In addition, we continue to pursue access to products and technologies developed outside the Company to complement our internal R&D efforts.
 Medical Device Segment
 As treatment technologies become more sophisticated and increasingly leverage minimally invasive techniques, we believe the need for improved medical devices that benefit from surface modification and device drug delivery will continue to grow. We intend to continue our development efforts to expand our whole-product solutions offerings including advancing our surface modification and device drug delivery technologies to better meet these needs across multiple medical markets and to capture more of the final product value. Our whole-products solutions R&D activities are primarily focused on the peripheral vascular market, where we believe the integration of our surface modification, balloon catheter and ultra-thin-walled catheter technologies will result in unique devices capable of producing better patient outcomes in complex, difficult-to-treat arterial disease cases. We are doing this by developing or acquiring technologies and funding development activities that may include pre-clinical and clinical studies.
 With the Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions and subsequent investments in our R&D infrastructure and facilities, we have strengthened our capabilities and broadened our capacity for R&D activities. Our facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland is fully equipped for R&D and manufacturing and is focused on design and manufacture of peripheral vascular devices. This facility’s capabilities include balloon forming, extrusion, coating, braiding and assembly of finished products. The facility is equipped for medical device R&D and manufacturing with space for future growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed an expansion of R&D and manufacturing clean rooms as well as an analytical lab to support our whole-product solutions strategy. With the NorMedix acquisition, we obtained a differentiated catheter-technology platform and additional design and development expertise that have enhanced the value we offer our medical device customers and accelerated our development of proprietary medical device products. We have continued to develop surface modification coating and DCB chemistry technologies in our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities. Our proprietary, whole-product solutions integrate our surface modification coatings, catheter and balloon technologies and are being developed with a combined team from our U.S. and Irish facilities. In addition to our DCB-platform products, we are executing on our plan to develop and commercialize 12-15 medical device products over the next 5 years. Additional planned activities include initiation of surface modification experiments that improve medical device performance, as well as incorporation of our catheter technology platform into various other devices intended for the emerging peripheral vascular treatment market. We received FDA clearance and CE Mark for the .014” PTA balloon catheter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and we expect to receive regulatory clearance for several additional, newly-developed products during calendar 2018.
 In addition to proprietary medical device product development, we work with our customers to integrate the best possible surface modification and device drug delivery technologies with their products, not only to meet their performance requirements, but also to perform services quickly so that the product may reach the market ahead of the competition. To quickly solve problems that might arise during the development and optimization process, we have developed extensive capabilities in analytical chemistry and surface characterization within our R&D organization. Our state-of-the-art instrumentation and extensive experience allow us to test the purity of coating reagents, to monitor the elution rate of drug from coatings, to measure coating thickness and smoothness, and to map the distribution of chemicals throughout coatings. We believe our capabilities in this area exceed those of our direct competitors.
 In Vitro Diagnostics Segment
 Our R&D efforts to grow our IVD business unit include identifying and addressing unmet needs that exist in the global IVD market place.  Our pipeline of IVD products includes components for immunoassay and molecular diagnostic applications, such as, new protein stabilizers, detection technologies, accessory reagents and surface coatings that have the potential to add greater sensitivity, specificity, speed, convenience and lower cost for IVD test manufacturers. In fiscal 2016 we launched StabilBlock® Immunoassay Stabilizer, our most advanced stabilizer product. 
 
Clinical Trials 
 Our PREVEIL first in-human early feasibility study using the SurVeil DCB completed enrollment in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In PREVEIL, six-month results indicated that acute success measures of safety were achieved in all patients, as well as 100 percent primary patency and encouraging late lumen loss at six months post-procedure. In July 2017, we received an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) from the FDA to initiate a pivotal clinical trial of the SurVeil DCB. The randomized clinical trial, TRANSCEND, 
 8

will evaluate the SurVeil DCB for treatment for PAD in the upper leg compared with the Medtronic IN.PACT® Admiral® DCB. The objective of the TRANSCEND clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SurVeil DCB device for treatment of subjects with symptomatic PAD due to stenosis of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries. If successful, the TRANSCEND clinical trial will be used to support regulatory approvals and reimbursement (U.S. and Europe). The trial will enroll up to 446 subjects at up to 60 sites in the U.S. and 18 outside the U.S. Study participants will be randomized to receive either treatment with SurVeil DCB or IN.PACT Admiral DCB. The trial’s primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency, defined as a composite of freedom from restenosis and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months post-index procedure. All randomized subjects will be followed through 60 months post-index procedure. We initiated enrollment in the TRANSCEND clinical trial in October 2017 and have engaged a clinical research organization to assist us with the administration of the clinical trial. There is no assurance that the TRANSCEND clinical trial will support regulatory approval, or that any anticipated time frame will be met. We estimate that the cost of the TRANSCEND clinical trial will range between $32 million to $40 million over the next several years.
 In connection with our whole-product solutions strategy, we plan to continue to sponsor and support clinical investigations to evaluate patient safety and clinical efficacy when necessary to support regulatory approval or clearance for new product initiatives. We will generate the clinical data necessary to seek regulatory approval or clearance for our existing and emerging products. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights

 Patents and other forms of proprietary rights are an essential part of Surmodics’ business. The Company aggressively pursues patent protection covering the proprietary technologies that we consider strategically important to our business. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we also generally file patent applications in European countries and, on a selective basis, other foreign countries. We strategically manage our patent portfolio so as to ensure that we have valid and enforceable patent rights protecting our technological innovations.
 We protect our extensive portfolio of technologies through filing and maintaining patent rights covering a variety of coatings, drug delivery methods, reagents, and formulations, as well as particular clinical device applications. During fiscal 2017, Surmodics filed 4 original U.S. patent applications, as well as 9 international patent applications. As of September 30, 2017, Surmodics owned or had exclusive rights to 55 pending U.S. patent applications and 135 foreign patent applications. Likewise, as of the same date, Surmodics owned or had exclusive rights to 147 issued U.S. patents and 198 international patents.
 We have licensed our PhotoLink hydrophilic technology on a non-exclusive basis to a number of our customers for use in a variety of medical device surface applications, including those described above. In particular, we have 30 issued U.S. patents, 10 pending U.S. patent applications, 34 issued international patents, and 32 pending international patent applications protecting various aspects of these technologies, including compositions, methods of manufacture and methods of coating devices. The expiration dates for these patents and anticipated expiration dates of the patent applications range from fiscal 2020 to 2035. Moreover, these patents and patent applications represent distinct families, with each family generally covering a successive generation of the technology, including improvements that enhance coating performance, manufacturability, or other important features desired by our customers. Among these, our third-generation PhotoLink technology is protected by a family of patents that expired in November 2015 (in the U.S.) and October 2016 (in certain other countries). In addition, our fourth-generation of our PhotoLink technology is protected by a family of patents that is expected to expire in early fiscal 2020. As noted above in “Licensing Arrangements,” the royalty obligation in our typical license agreement is generally for a specified number of years or the patent life, whichever is longer. In cases where the royalty obligation extends beyond the life of the applicable patent, it is because the license also includes rights to our know-how or other proprietary rights. Under these circumstances, the royalty obligation will continue at a reduced royalty rate for a specified number of years, as determined based on the specific terms and conditions of the applicable customer agreement, generally tied to the date on which the customer’s product was first sold. In recent years, we have successfully converted a number of our customer’s products utilizing this early generation technology to our advanced generation technologies. 
 The royalty revenue associated with our third-generation technology which has not yet converted, or is not in the process of converting, to our advanced generation technologies was approximately 12% of our fiscal 2017 revenue.   
 Approximately 21% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017 was generated from the fourth generation of our PhotoLink technology, which are protected by a family of patents that will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. Of the license agreements using our early generation technologies, most will continue to generate royalty revenue at a reduced royalty rate beyond patent expiration. 
 We also rely upon trade secrets, trademarks and other unpatented proprietary technologies. We seek to maintain the confidentiality of such information by requiring employees, consultants and other parties to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access by parties outside the Company to such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will 
 9

prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of this information, or that others will not be able to independently develop such information. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any agreements regarding confidentiality and non-disclosure will not be breached, or, in the event of any breach, that adequate remedies would be available to us.
 Marketing and Sales
 Our aim is to use our design, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities to provide our customers earlier access to highly differentiated products that address important unmet clinical needs, and partner with them on successful commercialization of these products.  While whole-product solutions development and manufacturing capability and capacity scale-up have been a significant focus, it does not change our business model to provide world-class surface modification coating technologies to our medical device customers. 
 Sales professionals working within our Medical Device business work in concert with our R&D personnel to coordinate customer activities. Our sales professionals’ specialization fosters an in-depth knowledge of the issues faced by our customers within these markets such as industry trends, technology changes, biomaterial changes and the regulatory environment. As we complete development of our whole-product solutions medical devices, we are seeking third-parties to sell these products. With respect to our diagnostics products, our sales professionals sell directly to IVD kit manufacturers and we enter into sales and marketing relationships with third parties to distribute those products around the world. We also offer those products for sale through our website. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding domestic and foreign revenue.
 To support our marketing and sales activities, we publish technical literature on our various surface modification, drug delivery, and in vitro diagnostics technologies and products. In addition, we exhibit at major trade shows and technical meetings, advertise in selected trade journals and through our website, and conduct direct mailings to appropriate target markets.
 We also offer ongoing customer service and technical support to our customers. This service and support may begin with a feasibility study, and also may include additional services such as assistance in the transfer of the technology to the customer, further optimization, process control and troubleshooting, preparation of product for clinical studies, and assistance with regulatory submissions for product approval. Some of these services are billable to customers, mainly feasibility and optimization activities.
 Acquisitions
 To further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses, we intend to continue to explore acquisitions and strategic collaborations to diversify and grow our business. As a result, we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe that we can broaden or enhance our technology offerings and expand our revenue sources and the markets in which we participate. Mergers and acquisitions of medical and diagnostic technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
Significant Customers
 Revenue from Medtronic represented approximately 18% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017 and was generated from multiple products and fields of use, substantially all of which were recognized in our Medical Device segment. The percentage of revenue from Medtronic decreased in fiscal 2017 as our customer base was diversified with the Fiscal 2016 Acquisitions. No other customer provided more than 6% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2017. Two customers in our IVD business accounted for 13% and 10%, respectively, of our IVD operating segment revenue.
Competition
 Medical Device Segment
 We believe that the intense competition within the medical device market creates opportunities for our technologies as medical device manufacturers seek to differentiate their products through new enhancements or to remain competitive with enhancements offered by other manufacturers. Upon receiving regulatory clearance for our proprietary products, we plan to seek third parties to sell these whole-product solutions products.  Our core balloon and catheter capabilities compete with larger original equipment manufacturer (OEM) suppliers, as well as some of our largest medical device partners that have in-house resources to produce balloons and catheters. We provide differentiated whole-product solutions that integrate our surface modification, catheter, balloon and other proprietary technologies.

Because a significant portion of our revenue depends on royalties derived from our customers’ medical device product sales incorporating our surface modification coating technologies, we are also affected by competition within the markets for such devices. As we typically license our surface modification coating technologies on a non-exclusive basis, we benefit by offering our technologies to multiple competing manufacturers of a device. However, competition in the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on us. While we seek to license our products to established manufacturers, in certain cases, our surface modification licensees may compete directly with larger, dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. We also are unable to control other factors that may impact commercialization of our whole-product solutions and licensees with medical devices that utilize our surface modification coatings, such as regulatory approval, marketing and sales efforts of our customers and licensees or competitive pricing pressures within the particular market.  Many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have.
 The ability for surface modification coating technologies to improve the performance of medical devices and drugs and to enable new product categories has resulted in increased competition in these markets. Some of our competitors offer device drug delivery technologies, while others specialize in lubricious or hemocompatible coating technology. Some of these companies target cardiovascular, peripheral or other medical device applications. In addition, because of the many product possibilities afforded by surface modification technologies, many of the large medical device manufacturers have developed, or are engaged in efforts to develop, internal competency in the area of surface modification and device drug delivery. 
 We attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing what we believe is a high value-added approach to drug delivery and surface modification technology. We believe that the primary factors customers consider in choosing a particular technology include performance (e.g., flexibility, ability to fine tune drug elution profiles, biocompatibility), ease of manufacturing, time-to-market, intellectual property protection, ability to produce multiple products from a single process, compliance with manufacturing regulations, ability to manufacture clinical and commercial products, customer service and total cost of goods (including manufacturing process labor). We believe our technologies deliver exceptional performance in these areas, allowing us to compete favorably with respect to these factors. With respect to our licensed surface modification technologies, we believe that the cost and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals significantly reduces the likelihood of a customer changing the manufacturing process it uses once a device or drug has been approved for sale.
 In Vitro Diagnostics Segment
 Competition in the diagnostics market is highly fragmented. In the product lines in which we compete (protein stabilization reagents, substrates, recombinant autoimmune antigens and surface chemistry technologies), we face an array of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Some of our competitors have substantially more capital resources, marketing experience, R&D resources and production facilities than we do. We believe that our products compete on performance, stability (shelf life), sensitivity (lower levels detected, faster results), consistency and price. We believe that our continued competitive success will depend on our ability to gain market share, to develop or acquire new proprietary products, obtain patent or other protection for our products and successfully market our products directly or through partners.
Manufacturing
 We manufacture our surface modification and drug delivery reagents, and our IVD products in our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facility. In certain limited circumstances, we also provide contract manufacturing services for our customers, including, for example, coating their medical devices that are intended for pre-clinical and clinical development (including human clinical trials), and products that are sold for commercial use by our customers. We manufacture balloon catheters in our Ballinasloe, Ireland facility, which offers a suite of capabilities, including balloon forming, extrusion, coating, braiding and assembly of finished products. We plan to manufacture substantially all of our whole-product solutions devices in our Irish facility by the end of fiscal 2018.
 We attempt to maintain multiple sources of supply for the key raw materials used to manufacture our products. We do, however, purchase some raw materials from single sources, but we believe that additional sources of supply are readily available. Further, to the extent additional sources of supply are not readily available, we believe that we could manufacture such raw materials.
 We follow quality management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance for the development and manufacture of materials and device, biotechnology or combination products that support clinical trials and commercialization. In an effort to better meet our customers’ needs in this area, our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facility is certified to ISO 13485 and ISO 9001. Our facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland is certified to ISO 13485. Each of these facilities is registered with the U.S. FDA as a “Contract Manufacturer.”

Government Regulation
 The medical devices, IVD and biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are required to undergo long, expensive and uncertain regulatory review processes that are governed by the U.S. FDA and other international regulatory authorities. New medical devices utilizing our surface modification coating technologies can only be marketed in the U.S. after a 510(k) application has been cleared or a PMA application has been approved by the FDA. This process can take anywhere from several months (e.g., for medical device products seeking regulatory approval under the 510(k) approval process) to several years (e.g., for medical device products seeking regulatory approval under the PMA application process). With respect to our customers’ products that incorporate our surface modification coating and IVD technologies, the burden of securing regulatory approval typically rests with our customers as the medical device manufacturers. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, Surmodics had multiple customers obtain regulatory clearance on medical devices incorporating our Serene coating platform. With respect to our whole-product solutions, including the SurVeil DCB and any additional medical device products that we develop, the burden of securing regulatory approval will rest on us unless we partner with other organizations to pursue such approval. 
 In support of our customers’ regulatory filings, we maintain various confidential Device Master Files with the FDA and provide technical information to other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. regarding the nature, chemical structure and biocompatibility of our reagents. Our licensees generally do not have direct access to these files. However, they may, with our permission, reference these files in their various regulatory submissions to these agencies. This approach allows regulatory agencies to understand in confidence the details of our technologies without us having to share this highly confidential information with our customers.
 U.S. legislation allows companies, prior to obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a medical product in the U.S., to manufacture medical products in the U.S. and export them for sale in international markets. This generally allows us to realize earned royalties sooner. However, sales of medical products outside the U.S. are subject to international requirements that vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2017, we had 257 employees. Of these employees we employ 101 outside the U.S., primarily in R&D and manufacturing operations functions. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
 We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, management and marketing personnel. We are committed to developing and providing our employees opportunities to contribute to our growth and success.
