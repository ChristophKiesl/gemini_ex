Item 1. Business.
Overview
Quotient Technology Inc. is an industry leading digital media and promotions technology company that powers cohesive omnichannel brand-building and sales-driving marketing campaigns for advertisers and retailers to influence purchasing decisions throughout a shopper's path to purchase. These marketing campaigns are planned, delivered and measured using our technology platforms and data analytics tools. Our vision is to build the world's leading performance marketing platform that delivers a variety of targeted digital marketing solutions which advertisers and retailers can purchase to drive measurable improvements in sales and customer loyalty. 
Our customers consist primarily of consumer-packaged goods ("CPG") companies and their brand marketers (together referred to as "advertisers") who want to drive sales and positive brand engagement with shoppers. Our digital marketing platform is designed to produce returns on marketing investment for advertisers by utilizing consumer behavior and intent data to deliver the right marketing message to the right shopper at the right time, through multiple touchpoints while they are engaged online, out of home and in-store. We partner with retailers, who primarily sell through local, physical stores as well as through eCommerce properties. We are primarily focused on the US-based grocery retail market and the advertisers who sell products through that channel. However we are expanding outside the grocery retail space, such as with partners in certain vertically-integrated industries (also known as "verticals"). 
By partnering with Quotient, retailers can monetize their proprietary sales data and digital properties to build an alternative revenue stream and offer effective marketing opportunities for their brand partners to engage consumers, with the aim of achieving higher sales through their physical stores and eCommerce sites.
Over the last five years, we have grown our platform capabilities and our network of marketing channels to reach shoppers through a combination of in-house innovation, partnerships, and acquisitions. Our network includes the digital properties of our retail partners, non-retail partners and CPG customers, social media platforms, and our consumer brand Coupons.com and digital out-of-home ("DOOH") properties. This network provides Quotient with proprietary and licensed data, including retailers' point-of-sale ("POS") shopper data, consumer behavior and purchase intent data, and location intelligence. With such data powering our platforms, customers and partners use Quotient to leverage consumer data and insights, engage consumers via digital channels, and integrate marketing and merchandising programs to drive measurable sales results and consumer engagement.
Our network is made up of several different constituencies:
•Our advertiser customers consist of approximately 900 CPGs, representing over 2,500 brands, including many of the leading food, beverage, personal care and household product manufacturers;
•Our retail partners represent multiple classes of trade such as grocery retailers, drug, automotive, mass merchant, dollar, club, and convenience merchandise channels, where most CPGs' products are sold;
•Our network partners currently include a select group of partners who invest in online consumer engagement and who help us to increase our network's reach to more US shoppers; and
•Millions of consumers who visit our owned websites, mobile properties and social channels, as well as those of our CPGs, retailer partners and other network partners.
Through these relationships, we believe we have created a network effect, which engages consumers and provides us a competitive advantage over both offline and online competitors. As our network expands and our consumer audience increases, we generate more consumer data and insights, which further improves our ability to deliver targeted and personalized media and promotions, and also strengthens our measurement and data insight solutions. We believe this will make our platforms more valuable to advertisers and retailers for their digital marketing campaigns. We expect that the breadth of media and promotion content delivered through Quotient platforms from leading brands will increase and enable us to attract and retain more retailers and consumers. 
We primarily generate revenue by advertisers and retailers using our technology platforms to help achieve their digital marketing objectives in four distinct ways:
•Plan and buy media and promotions campaigns to reach the right shoppers;
•Target advertising, promotions and messaging to shoppers for maximum impact;
•Sell advertising space and activate the shopper data that retailers collect through loyalty programs and digital transactions; and
•Measure the impact of advertisements, promotions or messages that have been planned, sold or placed with "closed loop" measurement, defined as the use of consumer data to help understand and evaluate how certain digital campaigns impact our advertiser customers' and retailer partners' sales.
Using shopper data from our retail partners and our proprietary data and audience segments, we deliver targeted and/or personalized digital media and promotions to shoppers through our network. As our customers and partners shift more of their marketing spend to digital channels, our solutions help them optimize the performance of such digital channels. Our platforms measure performance by attribution of digital campaigns to retail purchases in near real time, demonstrating return on spend for our customers and partners.
Our promotions products include digital paperless coupons, digital print coupons, in-lane receipt promotions, digital national promotions, shopper promotions, digital rebates and loyalty offers. Our media solutions include display, social, DOOH, Retailer.com display and sponsored search, shoppable brand pages, and audiences. A growing number of our customers purchase an integrated campaign which combines a mix of digital media and/or promotions solutions within a single campaign. While the revenue we earn from these programs is generally determined on a cost-per-click, cost-per-impression or cost-per-acquisition basis, in 2021 we launched duration-based (also known as time-based) pricing for our new offering Duration-Based National Promotions Solution, which we plan to deploy to a greater extent in the future (See "Business Model Changes" in this Item 1. Overview Section). 
We generally pay a distribution fee, or revenue share, to retailers and publishers for activation or redemption of a digital promotion, for media campaigns, and for use of data targeting and/or measurement. We also pay a fee to third-party publishers and distribution partners for traffic acquisition, which consists of delivering campaigns on certain networks or properties. Generally, these distribution, revenue share and third-party service fees are included in our cost of revenues because we control the digital promotion and media advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. In limited instances where we do not control the digital promotion and media advertising inventory, we record revenues on a net basis, and the distribution, revenue-share and third-party service fees are deducted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues. 
During 2021, we generated revenues of $521.5 million, representing 17% growth over 2020, and a net loss of $45.6 million in 2021 as compared to a net loss of $65.4 million in 2020. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues during each respective period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was one customer that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues.
Business Model Changes
During 2021, we began to evolve our business model to better align our offerings to the demand in the marketplace. We have historically supported our customers using a managed service approach to digital marketing by supporting the advertiser with services throughout the campaign’s planning, execution and measurement phases. A trend in our industry is that an increasing percentage of CPGs, national advertising agencies and other advertisers are looking for transparency in the pricing and execution features of a campaign, and also for more self-service capabilities whereby they have more control over the campaign. In response to this trend, in the third quarter of 2021 we introduced self-service capabilities on some of our media products related to sponsored search. With self-service campaigns, the customer decides on campaign objectives and which digital property to place advertisements. We believe moving more business to self-service and away from managed services will enable us to grow more profitably by utilizing the power of our platform technology and reducing the manual effort and overhead expenses associated with managed-service campaign execution. Our sponsored search solutions are designed to utilize our data and market intelligence to target the most appropriate shoppers. As a result of these and related operational changes, we began recognizing revenue net of third-party costs on our sponsored search offering. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information.
During the first quarter of 2021, we introduced a new offering, Duration-Based National Promotions Solution, for our national promotions business. This offering provides advertisers access to our proprietary platforms for a specific period of time (the campaign period) in exchange for a fixed fee. This allows retailers and advertisers to coordinate merchandising calendars and specify time periods during which the promotion is run. Duration-based pricing also more directly aligns with the traditional way in which promotions have been priced and executed using traditional physical coupons distributed through the free-standing insert (“FSI”) historically included in the daily or Sunday newspaper. 
Promotions that are still run under our historical cost-per click or cost-per-acquisition model could result in a digital coupon or rebate that is available online for only the first few days of a campaign, if shopper activations are higher than expected. Under our new duration-based pricing model, a promotional offer will be available for use during the entire planned start and end dates, which generally are between seven and twenty-eight days.
We believe this duration-based pricing and delivery model change is beneficial to our retailer partners and advertisers as it aligns with their traditional methods of budgeting for marketing spend and executing on merchandising plans. Duration-based pricing promotions revenue represented approximately 32% of national promotions revenue during the fourth quarter of 2021, and we expect that percentage to increase rapidly in the upcoming quarters. We also plan to expand duration-based pricing to shopper promotions in 2022.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we also began rolling out a change to our business model with respect to retailer-specific promotion or media campaigns (also known as shopper campaigns). In our traditional shopper model, advertisers are our customers and retailers are marketing distribution partners through whom we deliver shopper campaigns, where we have discretion in establishing pricing and control the digital promotion and media before the campaign is delivered to our customer. In the new shopper model, we sell shopper campaigns to advertisers on behalf of the retailers. Under the new model, retailers set pricing and determine how shopper media and promotions campaigns are executed through our platforms and network. In accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles, in this model we are the agents of the retailers, who are customers and pay us for the use of our platforms and services. This business model change is designed to provide several benefits to retailer customers including improved pricing transparency and control over the shopper marketing campaign’s prospects for success. 
Our Industry
Our growth is driven by several major market trends that impact our industry:
Moving budgets from offline to digital – Marketing methods that traditionally have been executed offline are continuing to move to online digital marketing. Historically, the vast majority of CPG's budgets have been spent in offline channels, such as the FSI found in newspapers, direct mail, printed circulars, in-store aisle tags, end caps and television. These traditional offline channels are becoming less effective as consumers spend more time online, particularly through mobile devices, and a feature of this trend is the rising importance of using data to drive personalized and targeted content to consumers. To reach consumers at the right time and place, now more than ever, CPGs are shifting media and promotion dollars that have been historically spent in offline channels to digital channels. Over the past year, the vast majority of US grocery purchases were still made in-person in physical grocery retail stores. However, as mobile applications and the use and utility of smartphones continue to grow, an increasing percentage of shoppers are engaging digitally in their path to purchase. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift and drove significant increases in the use of eCommerce for grocery and other retail transactions. More purchasing decisions being made online means, in our view, that advertisers must move advertising budgets to online vehicles in order to influence more shoppers during their path to purchase.
Collaborative spend programs and merchandising calendars – For decades, CPGs and retailers have been focused on driving sales. However, only recently have they started to work more collaboratively to increase sales and revenue through the utilization of data, which in turn benefits both parties. CPGs sell their products to retailers, and retailers are responsible for selling those products directly to consumers. To help retailers attract consumers and ensure sales, CPGs spend over $225 billion annually in promotions, media, shopper marketing, trade and other in-store advertising. Excluding trade and certain other budgets from the $225 billion results in approximately $117 billion of spend, which we believe is a total addressable market metric for the solutions we offer on Quotient's platforms. 
At the same time, traditional retailers are paving the path for the digital shift by utilizing technology and creating digital strategies to better compete and drive sales. This includes focusing on retail performance media, loyalty strategies, eCommerce experiences, and data-driven media platforms, many of which Quotient powers for its retailers and partners. As retailers expand their digital capabilities, and as shoppers increase their digital engagement through more eCommerce purchases or a mixed mode of online and in-store purchases, greater opportunities are created for CPGs to shift marketing dollars from offline to digital, as well as to collaborate better with retailers.
National digital promotions including rebates, primarily funded by CPGs' consumer marketing budgets, have been found to be more effective and are redeemed at higher rates compared to traditional offline promotions. We believe that the ease of creating and delivering digital promotions, coupled with the increasing size and broadening demographic reach of online audiences, will drive continued momentum for digital promotions.
Additionally, shopper digital media and promotions, typically funded by CPGs' consumer marketing budgets to increase consumer awareness and drive sales within a specific retailer, continue to shift from traditional in-store and print promotion and media solutions to digital ones, particularly as regards the mobile device user. Consumer marketers are looking to reach consumers directly across the right touchpoints throughout the path to purchase, and thereby to influence their purchase decisions. 
As the shift to digital media and promotions continues to grow, so does the importance placed on the use of data to target audiences and measure campaign performance. As a greater portion of grocery sales have shifted from offline to online, retailers are focused on implementing omnichannel strategies, technology, and solutions to meet consumer demands, to compete effectively and to drive sales. This omnichannel approach, which leverages combined data from offline and online sales, is resulting in an increased number of digital touchpoints for retailers and their CPGs to target shoppers with relevant promotions and digital marketing. As retailers add more omnichannel capabilities, brands increasingly are able to shift more marketing dollars to digital. 
Our Platforms and Solutions
We offer industry-leading digital platforms providing technology and services that power integrated digital media and promotions campaigns for brands and retailers. We do this through personalized and targeted media and promotions for the purpose of driving profitable sales, building shopper loyalty and increasing brand awareness and affinity. Our customers use our platforms to plan, manage and distribute digital media and promotions, target shopper audiences, and measure campaign performance and sales results.  
Our solutions fall into the following categories:
Promotions
Quotient Promotions Platform (for CPGs)
The Quotient Promotions Platform offers digital paperless promotions, digital print promotions, and cash back rebates across our distribution network. With digital paperless and rebates, shoppers add promotions directly to retailer loyalty accounts for automatic digital redemption, or use a mobile device to take a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for cash back redemption. With digital print, shoppers select promotions and print them from their desktop or mobile device to redeem in store.
Through this platform, brands and retailers can reach shoppers on the web and on mobile devices by offering digital promotions through our extensive network which includes:
•brand and retailer websites and mobile applications;
•thousands of third-party publisher websites and mobile applications; and
•the Coupons.com website and our Coupons.com mobile applications.
The Quotient Promotions Platform offers national digital promotions from brands and retail-specific promotions sourced from shopper marketers and retailers. Other platform solutions include in-lane on receipt promotions, loyalty rewards promotions, digital rebates, and specialty retail or promotional codes and rebates. Promotions can be personalized and/or targeted to shoppers through a combination of data points including shopper purchase and intent data, historical purchase transactions, promotion activations 
and redemptions, shopper interests, online click and search behavior, demographics, and location data. These techniques enable us to optimize the delivery of promotions across the network and drive campaign performance.
Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform (for retailers)
The Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform is used by top retailers in the grocery, drug, automotive, , mass merchant, dollar, club and convenience merchandise channels to integrate into their POS systems or loyalty programs. This platform solution is designed to function as a component of the retailer's digital marketing platform, to create a direct, digital relationship with shoppers, and to engage them through an omnichannel experience. Through the Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform, we use consumer data and insights to distribute personalized and targeted media and promotions, primarily funded by our advertiser customers, to help drive consumer loyalty and increase sales. Additional solutions on this platform include personalized e-mails, targeted in-lane promotions at checkout, loyalty rewards, rebate offers, digital grocery lists, digital receipts, branding landing pages, and digital circulars.
Media
Quotient Media Platform (for CPGs)
The Quotient Media platform offers targeted advertising solutions, enabling brands to reach shoppers before, during and after their shopping cycles with digital media campaigns. Brands can leverage our proprietary shopper data and audience segments to deliver targeted media ads across our network, including retail partners, other network partners and Coupons.com, and also across third-party publishers’ web, mobile and social channels outside our network. For example, we can target, with advertising within certain product categories, consumers on Meta Platforms, Inc.'s platform called Facebook ("Facebook") who have redeemed a promotion or purchased a product in that particular product category.
Our media solutions include display, social, DOOH, Retailer.com display and sponsored search, shoppable brand pages and audiences.
Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform (for retailers)
The Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform ("RPM") provides retailers with the technology to build a sustainable omnichannel strategy leveraging their consumer data and digital properties to drive sales and enhance the shopper experience. Through the RPM, brand marketers can use specific retail data to target and deliver media directly to shoppers and measure direct sales results. Additionally, retailers deliver digital media campaigns through RPM. Solutions included on this platform include onsite media (sponsored search and display) and offsite media (programmatic, desktop and mobile, DOOH, social and self-service demand side platform ("DSP")). Quotient distributes this targeted media content via retailer digital properties, our expansive publisher network including Coupons.com web and mobile sites, and other third-party publishing sites. We also power Quotient Digital Circular, a personalized retail circular experience for shoppers, with targeted media units for CPGs to showcase their products and drive sales.
Quotient Analytics 
Quotient Analytics provides campaign analytics and measured sales results to brands and retailers, attributing digital promotions and/or media campaigns to in-store and online purchases. Through Quotient Analytics, we combine purchase data from select retailers across the Quotient Retailer Promotion Platform and/or the Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform with online engagement and purchase-intent data from Quotient’s flagship brand, Coupons.com, and the Company’s thousands of publishing partners. Our campaign measurement tools are also designed to provide brands and retailers with flexibility to adjust their campaigns in mid-flight to drive greater efficiency with marketing dollars. This capability and analysis is provided to customers who utilize our promotions and media platforms. Our campaign measurement tools provide the basis for our calculations to CPGs regarding their Return-on-Ad-Spend and Return-on-Promotion-Spend. As our platforms, network impact and audience numbers expand, we believe that the value of our data and analytics increases. 
Quotient Consumer Properties
Our consumer properties complement our platform offerings and enable us to deliver critical capabilities. We provide CPGs and other parties access to our Coupons.com, Coupons.com Brandcaster and Shopmium audiences, including our website and mobile properties, to market their brands in ways that include premium media and product placements on our site, promoted positions within our coupon galleries, and otherwise with premium display within our owned and operated digital properties.
Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our platforms and our business through the following key strategies:
Increase revenues from CPGs already on our platforms as well as expand our CPG base. 
From our experience to date, we believe we have opportunities to continue increasing revenues from our existing customer base through:
•increasing our share of CPG spending on overall media and promotions by providing CPGs with a high return on their marketing investments and their deployment of larger digital marketing budgets as CPGs move from off-line spend to on-line digital marketing spend;
•increasing the number of brands from each advertiser that are using our platforms; 
•leveraging data to provide our customers and partners with more insights, including campaign performance, and to distribute more targeted promotions, media, and analytics across our retail partner properties, our network including our owned and operated properties, and third-party sites; and
•maximizing consumer experiences across all products.
Increase the growing number of smaller CPG advertisers that use, or desire to use, our solutions. 
We believe we have an opportunity to capture this revenue through:
•a dedicated sales team focused on smaller CPGs; and
•leveraging our solutions and retailer platforms to provide this segment of customers with digital opportunities on a national and shopper level versus traditional solutions such as the offline FSI that, due to such customers' smaller market size, such customers historically have not had the ability to access.
Grow our digital promotions business.      We plan to grow our digital promotions business by increasing the reach of our promotions platforms. We believe our users will increase through our increasing the number of retail partners and other network partners who are delivering our promotions to consumers, and by increasing the number of promotions that brands offer on our platforms as we leverage the shift from offline to digital channels. We expect much of this growth to come from CPG and retailer budgets that have transitioned away from traditional offline coupon solutions such as the FSI. Additionally, smaller advertisers who have been excluded from the FSI due to their smaller market size are seeking to take advantage of the market shift to digital solutions for promotions. By bringing additional retailers and other network partners into our network, our ability to expand our targeted promotions and expand our audience reach grows, increasing our ability to more effectively engage shoppers and drive sales. We plan to continue to expand consumer participation on the Quotient Promotions Platform through our solutions, such as national promotions, targeted digital paperless promotions, brand loyalty promotions, and national rebates.  
Grow our network and add retailers in new verticals.    We believe that we have an opportunity to grow our publishing network, expand our reach to engaged consumers, and drive volume of transactions on our platforms. We also believe we have an opportunity to grow the number of retailers that we partner with, thereby increasing the value of our platforms to advertisers and consumers. Also, we intend to continue growing our network with the addition to our platforms of retailers in new verticals, such as automotive, outside of our core grocery vertical.
Grow our digital media business.     As the industry continues to see eCommerce growth, the market for our digital media capabilities grows. We plan to capitalize on this through our digital media business, including the Quotient RPM, programmatic display, social, DOOH, and our self-service sponsored search offering, as we see continued demand for these solutions from CPGs and our retail partners. We plan to continue to innovate and invest in our media solutions, expanding the use of our proprietary data as well as data from select retail partnerships, and 
by adding and expanding relationships including those with national media buyers and publishers, new partnerships, verticals, and third parties such as media agencies.
Offer more integrated digital media and promotions solutions. We continue to focus our sales strategy on further integrating digital media and promotions, including selling these offerings together through packaged solutions. We believe that brand spend on digital media and promotions will continue to grow as POS, mobile channels and social media offer new opportunities to engage consumers on their path to purchase.
Fraud Prevention and Distribution Controls
Our platforms include a proprietary digital distribution management system designed to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for linking coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique identifier (ID) that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique identifier ("ID") also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platforms allow us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons. We also have a proprietary rebate distribution solution with built-in authentication capabilities through phone and payment verification. Additionally, we have transactional level controls for rebates to enforce stacking rules and prevent receipt alteration and/or manipulation. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. We believe that our sales, integration, digital media and promotions campaign management and analytics capabilities, as well as our customer success and support capabilities, are difficult to replicate and are a key reason for the growth of our business. Our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands within existing and new CPG customers, including smaller CPGs, that offer digital media and promotions through our platforms as well as increasing the revenue from those brands currently using our platforms. The team is also focused on expanding relationships within CPGs to include their shopper marketing and digital media teams, where we believe there is a large opportunity for growth. Additionally, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our publisher and network partner networks. We are also seeking to partner with retailers in our non-core verticals.
In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers with the aim of ensuring that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified time frames. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.
We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new revenue pipelines from both CPGs and retailers. We often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team runs targeted digital marketing programs, develops data-led collateral and customer case studies, sponsors and conducts research, and delivers engaging content through social media channels. 
Technology and Infrastructure
Since inception, we have made significant investments and we plan to continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary platforms aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on solutions that provide measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and data scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include:
•Scalable infrastructure.    We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software in seeking to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platforms. We use a combination of public and private cloud computing 
platforms. Our private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across data centers in co-location facilities situated in California and Virginia.
•Redundancy.    Our critical production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to another data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site are designed to provide fast recovery whenever recovery is requested. Each single data center has been designed to handle an activity level in excess of our entire system needs, the goal of which is to enable us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact.
•Reporting.    Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide campaign insights.
•AdTech.    Our media delivery is largely powered by proprietary ad servers, creative and social platforms, workflow automation tools, and data management tools. We develop and use these platforms with a range of differentiated features that are specialized for the CPG and retail industries.
•Security.    Our security policy adheres to established policies that are designed to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it.
Competition
We compete against a variety of companies with respect to different aspects of our business, including:
•providers of digital promotions such as Valassis Communications, Inc., Catalina Marketing Corporation’s Cellfire; Inmar/You Technology; Neptune Retail Services' (formerly known as News America Marketing) SmartSource; companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc.; and Neptune Retail Services' Checkout 51;
•offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in FSIs or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., Neptune Retail Services and Catalina Marketing Corporation;
•retailers who develop and manage, with or without a third-party vendor, digital advertising or data products in-house, such as the Albertsons Companies' ("Albertsons") recently-announced launch of the Albertsons Media Collective, or The Kroger Company ("Kroger") with its wholly owned subsidiary of 84.51°; 
•companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and advertisers, such as Flipp Corp.; and
•companies offering digital advertising technology, inventory, data, and services solutions and channels for advertisers and retailers including Facebook, Alphabet, Inc. ("Alphabet"), Pinterest, Inc., Amazon.com ("Amazon"), Inc., Adobe Inc., The Trade Desk, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Criteo S.A., Microsoft Corporation, Publicis Groupe's CitrusAd and others.
In certain instances, we have entered into, and in the future we may enter into, strategic alliances or partnerships with companies that are competitors in other areas of our business. We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following:
•scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting advertisers and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other digital properties;
•scale and reach of a company's retailer network; 
•scale and reach of a company's targetable audience data;
•ability to attract consumers to a company's platform;
•platform security, usability, scalability, reliability and availability;
•integration with retailer applications, POS systems, and consumer channels;
•access to consumer data;
•measurement that demonstrates the effectiveness of campaigns; 
•quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of digital marketing campaigns;
•integration of products and solutions;
•rapid deployment of products and services for customers;
•breadth, quality and relevance of a company's solutions;
•ability to deliver high quality and increasing numbers of digital promotions that are widely available and easy to use in consumers’ preferred form;
•brand recognition and reputation; and 
•ability to recruit, retain, and train employees.
While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger, more-established and greater-resourced companies that seek to enter our market, or from smaller companies that launch new products, solutions and services that could gain market acceptance.
Human Capital Resources
Our plan for long-term business success is driven by technological innovation, superior client service, and operational excellence. We operate under a single purpose - transforming shopping to make life better for consumers, brands, retailers and our employees. Attracting, developing and retaining top talent are critical to our long-term business goals and to fulfilling our Company purpose. We know that investing in our people is just as important as investing in our products.
In 2021, the majority of our workforce continued to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To support employees while working from home, we offered Wi-Fi reimbursement, expanded home office equipment support, enhanced health and wellness programs, and converted training to a virtual format. Quotient strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated, providing flexible time off to accommodate employee schedules. The Bangalore office coordinated with healthcare providers to sponsor an on-site vaccination drive for employees and their families. We are planning to formally return to the office in early 2022 under a hybrid work model.
We continue positioning the Company for growth, and expect that innovation in our solutions, especially around self-service and automation, will lead to an improved bottom-line, a better customer experience and the potential to expand our customer and partner base. In the second half of 2021, the Company evaluated areas of the business in which to initiate cost-cutting activities, and in some cases, jobs were impacted. In addition, the wind down of our partnership with Albertsons led to a reduction-in-force to reduce our costs and better align spend with anticipated future revenues. Employees impacted were provided a transition period and severance package. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized restructuring expense of $0.5 million related to the wind down of our partnership with Albertsons. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,162 full-time employees, consisting of 693 employees in the United States and 469 employees internationally. Voluntary workforce turnover was 27% in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our global workforce was 52% female, and nearly 44% of our employees holding a "manager or above" title were women. As of such date, women represented 50% of our executive leadership team. 
We strive to create an environment that welcomes and supports diversity and promotes equity and inclusion across all levels of the Company. Our volunteer-based Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Council focuses on four key areas: Awareness and Education, Community Outreach, Recruitment, and Development & Retention. In 2021, we partnered with Eskalera, Inc. to launch a robust training platform to build greater DEI awareness, maximize individual potential and elevate decision-making in the workplace.
We believe that investing in our employees' development is pivotal to ensuring sustainable performance success as a high-growth global technology company. We are committed to providing training and development that supports employees in their current roles and beyond.
Our Talent and Performance process aligns performance to reward and provides actionable feedback to employees. Twice a year, leaders commit to a comprehensive organization and talent review, covering key elements such as organization structure, employee performance and potential, succession planning and employee development. In 2021, we introduced a new learning system that provides access to on-demand training through a leading learning platform with over 16,000 content and expert-led courses. In addition, internally-created content on a variety of Quotient topics provides just-in-time training for managers and employees right when they need it.
We have a long-standing culture of helping local communities and neighbors through our philanthropic program. In January 2021, the program was rebranded to Quotient for Change and is committed to providing communities with tangible outcomes through our three key pillars: Economic Stability, Technological Equity and Environmental Sustainability. We also launched a new matching gift program in 2021, which offers all full-time employees a monetary match on their charitable donations. We donated over $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, supporting over 485 charities globally, and logged over 1,750 volunteer hours.

We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and equivalent rights in other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we hold or have exclusive rights to 51 active issued patents in the United States and 39 active patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2022 and 2039.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective, or may require significant expenditures and other resources to enforce. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could harm our business and our operating results, or our ability to compete.
Companies in Internet-related and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to in the past, and we expect that we may face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
