Item 1. Business
 
Our Company is engaged in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral properties within the Homestake Gold District of the Black Hills of South Dakota. To date, while no development or mining activities have commenced, our strategy is to move projects from exploration to development and finally on to mining as results of exploration may dictate. Dakota Territory’s management and technical teams have extensive mining and exploration experience in the Homestake District and we intend to leverage our experience together with our business presence in South Dakota to create value for our shareholders. 
The Company currently holds four brownfield project areas in the district comprised of 404 unpatented claims and a combination of surface and mineral leases covering a total of approximately 7,166 acres. Our goal is to obtain sufficient capital to advance our current property portfolio, to fund acquisition of additional prospective mineral property, and for the general working capital needs of the Company.
 
Recent Developments
 
Dakota Territory entered into an agreement with JR Resources Corp. (“JR”) in May 2020 (“Agreement”) whereby JR loaned the Company $1,150,000 and the Company granted JR the right to purchase up to 142,566,667 shares of common stock at $0.15 per share (approximate 64.24% on a fully diluted basis) in one or more closings on or prior to October 15, 2020 (“Termination Date”). The Agreement allows Dakota to advance its current mineral property acquisition strategy with a seasoned team of mining and exploration executives with a track record of building mines and mining companies from quality assets. The Company intends to use proceeds from this loan to acquire up to $350,000 of mineral interests or properties, up to $500,000 to conduct an airborne geophysical survey, and the balance for general corporate and working capital purposes.
 
Upon execution of this Agreement, JR and the Company entered into an amended and restated promissory note in the amount of $1,450,000, of which $300,000 was advanced in February 2020 and $1,150,000 was advanced in May 2020. The note is unsecured and bears interest at the annual rate of 0.25%, compounded annually, payable on December 31, 2021. Upon a closing of a change of control transaction with JR as a result of the purchase of shares of common stock pursuant to the Agreement (“Change of Control Closing”), JR will be required to exercise, and will in fact be deemed to have exercised, its right to convert the principal of and accrued interest on the note into Company common stock at the rate of $0.15 per share. On the maturity date, the principal amount of the note, together with any accrued but unpaid interest, will be due and payable in cash, provided that, if and to the extent that the Company does not pay this note in cash on the maturity date, then JR will be required to exercise, and will in fact be deemed to have exercised, its right to convert such unpaid portion of the note into shares of Company common stock. The conversion price is $0.15 per share through December 31, 2020 and, thereafter, the lesser of $0.15 per share and the volume weighted average price of Company common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of such conversion (with a floor of $0.10 per share). The note has customary event of default provisions and, upon an event of default, JR will be required to convert the unpaid portion of the note into the shares of Company common stock, if not paid prior thereto in cash by the Company.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, JR shall have the right, prior to the Termination Date, to purchase the 142,566,667 shares (for a purchase price of up to $21,385,000, reduced by the amount of note converted) in one or more closings from the Company. Each closing is subject to negotiation of closing deliverables and satisfaction of closing conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the Company and JR, including agreement on how the proceeds will be utilized. In the event of a Change of Control Closing, the closing deliverables to be negotiated and mutually agreed upon include the application of the use of proceeds, negotiation of employment agreements, agreement on equity grants pursuant to an equity compensation plan to be adopted, and amended bylaws to be adopted that will govern the appointment of JR director designees. There is no assurance that closing deliverables will be agreed upon and that any closing will occur, as JR is not obligated to purchase any of the 142,566,667 shares of common stock.
 
JR and the Company agree to set up a technical committee to identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities, plan and conduct field programs, develop a framework and platform for the Company’s database, conduct data research, compile and assemble data, organize work programs to evaluate potential mineral inventories and develop long term exploration and mining strategies including capital and operating budgets.
 
Until the Termination Date, the Company has agreed to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and without the prior consent of JR the Company shall not:
 

adopt or propose any amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws;  
 

effect any equity financings in excess of $250,000, exclusive of any common stock issued upon, and any proceeds received from, the exercise of outstanding derivative securities and common stock issued upon conversion by JR of the note; 
 

incur any additional debt or issue any debt securities other than in the ordinary course of business;  

8




make any material loans or advances or assume or guarantee any obligations, except for existing financing arrangements or otherwise in the ordinary course of business;  
 

sell, transfer, assign, relinquish or dispose of any material asset or property; and  
 

other than in the ordinary course of business, modify or amend in any material respect or terminate any material contract.  
 
If and upon a Change of Control Closing, it is contemplated that the Company board shall consist of JR designees and certain current Company directors, as Company designees, it being understood that the number of Company directors shall not exceed five, and that the number of JR designees at any given time shall be one more than the number of Company designees. In the event of any vacancy in the office of any JR designee, a majority of the remaining JR designees shall have the right to designate a replacement, and in the event of any vacancy in the office of any Company designee, a majority of the remaining Company designees shall have the right to designate a replacement, in each case to fill such vacancy. These rights will be incorporated in amended bylaws to be negotiated and mutually agreed upon. Prior to such appointment of JR director nominees, the Company shall cause a Schedule 14f-1 to be filed with the SEC and mailed to the Company shareholders. It is expected that the amended bylaws shall provide for, among other things, the board composition mechanisms during the Standstill Period (as defined in the following sentence). The Standstill Period means the period ending on the earlier of (i) 18 months from a Change of Control Closing and (ii) the uplisting of the Company common stock (or the common stock of a successor-in-interest to the Company) to the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
During the Standstill Period, JR has agreed to the following corporate governance provisions, among others:
 

to not vote its shares of common stock to remove any Company designee without the consent of a majority of the Company designees or approve a material amendment to the articles of incorporation or the amended bylaws unless approved and recommended by a majority of the Company Designees;  
 

JR shall vote its shares of common stock for the election of Company designees; 
 

any transaction between JR or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (including, without limitation, the issuance of Company capital stock or derivative securities to JR or any of its affiliates and entering into certain business combinations by and between JR, the Company and any of their respective affiliates), shall be subject to approval by the Company designees and the JR designees shall recuse themselves from voting on the approval of such transactions; and  
 

not to engage in proxy solicitations or certain communications (other than in connection with a sale of the Company to a third party), or acquire additional shares of Company common stock or assets of the Company, in each case without the approval of the Company designees.  
 
In June 2020, the Company secured the services of New-Sense Geophysics Ltd. (“New-Sense”) to undertake a high resolution helicopter-borne district scale magnetic and radiometric survey of the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. New-Sense is an industry leader in the collection and data processing of airborne geophysics. Robert B. Ellis (EGC Inc.) has also been engaged to consult on the design of the survey for Dakota Territory and will oversee data acquisition, provide additional processing and modeling of the data, and work with the Dakota Territory’s technical team to integrate the high resolution geophysics with the Company’s geology and geochemistry data sets. 
 
Subsequent to March 31, 2020, outstanding warrants entitling the holders to purchase an aggregate of 2,200,000 shares of common stock were exercised. We received proceeds in the amount of $220,000 from the exercise of these warrants. 
 
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada in 2002. The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from operations. The Company’s gold initiatives included:
 

The September 2012 acquisition of North Homestake Mining Company, a private Nevada corporation that owned the Blind Gold Property located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The Blind Gold Property was initially comprised of eighty-four unpatented mining claims covering approximately 1,600 acres and is located approximately four miles northwest of the historic Homestake Gold Mine. The Blind Gold Property is underlain by the Homestake Formation, an iron-formation that is the unique host for gold mineralization at the Homestake Mine. The two founders of North Homestake have 44-years of combined exploration, mining and management experience at the Homestake Mine, and own a 5% net smelter return royalty recorded on the original eighty-four claims that comprised the property acquired through the transaction.


The December 2012 acquisition of three groups of unpatented lode mining claims from Black Hills Gold Exploration LLC. Comprised of fifty-seven unpatented lode mining claims, the property acquisition covers approximately 853 acres in total. Twenty-three of the claims acquired are situated to the west, south and southeast of the Company's Blind Gold Property, with the balance of the claims establishing the Homestake Paleoplacer and City Creek Properties. All three groups of unpatented claims are brownfields exploration targets based on the previous work performed by Homestake Mining Company. With the addition of the new property in 2012, Dakota Territory increased the size of its land package in the Black Hills by approximately 50% to nearly 2,466 acres in total. 
 

The February 2014 acquisition of surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Located immediately to the north and adjoining the Company’s Homestake Paleoplacer Property, Mineral Survey 1706 was explored by Homestake Mining Company in the late 1980’s. 
 

The March 2014 acquisition of approximately 565.24 mineral acres in the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. The acquisition increased our mineral interests in the Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property acquisition, we purchased an additional 64.39 mineral acres located immediately southwest and contiguous to our Paleoplacer Property, including mineral title to the historic Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke Gold Mines. The March 2014 acquisition consolidated and extended our Paleoplacer Property position to a distance extending approximately 3,100 feet along the trend of the channel. 
 

The April 2017 acquisition of a combination of surface and mineral title to 284 acres in the Homestake District of the Northern Black Hills of South Dakota. The acquisition included 61 acres located immediately south and contiguous with our City Creek Property; 82 acres located approximately one half mile south of our Blind Gold Property at the western fringe of the historic Maitland Gold Mine; and 141 acres located immediately north and contiguous to our Homestake Paleoplacer Property, which added approximately 2,600 feet of the channel trend to our property position. 
 

The November 2018 acquisition of 42 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 718 acres located immediately to the north and adjacent to the Company’s City Creek Property. The acquisition was based on our inversion modeling of magnetic and gravity geophysical survey data. Through this staking, the City Creek project area was expanded from approximately 449 acres to 1,167 acres. 
 

The September 2019 acquisition of 106 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 1,167 acres in close proximity to the historic Tinton Gold Camp. The Tinton area was the site of placer mining activity between 1876 and the turn of the century, the lode source for which has not been discovered. The Company has based the acquisition of this property on extensive research conducted by members of our technical team at Homestake Mining Company. 
 

The March 6, 2020 acquisition of 65 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 1,152 acres in the Homestake District of the Black Hills of South Dakota. The property is contiguous to the Company's Blind Gold Property and is the subject to historic prospecting activity that we believe suggests the occurrence of gold and/or silver mineralization at multiple locales on the property. We believe that the property is also a target for Pre-Cambrian Homestake style gold mineralization under the younger cover rocks based on the Company’s projections of the Homestake stratigraphic sequence (Ellison, Homestake, and Poorman Formations) and inversion modeling of geophysical survey data completed by our technical team in late 2018. 
 
U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources will ever be converted into SEC Guide 7 Compliant Reserves. We have not established that any of our properties contain proven or probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7.
 
Competitors
 
The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, some with greater financial resources available to them. We therefore will be at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, there are established and well-financed companies active in the mining industry that will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties.

Government Approvals
 
The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus, permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include “permitting” or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, any mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once any commercial mining operations have ceased.
 
Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”), the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 
The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the State of South Dakota. If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.

11



Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment, and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are primarily responsible for such discharges.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities, although costs may increase in future periods.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our management, all of whom are consultants, conducts our operations. Given the early stage of our exploration properties, we intend to continue to outsource our professional and personnel requirements by retaining consultants on an as needed basis. However, if we are successful in our initial and any subsequent drilling programs, we may retain employees. 
Insurance
 
We currently do not maintain any insurance coverage to cover losses or risks incurred in the ordinary course of business.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company has spent only nominal amounts during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development activities.
 
Office Facilities 
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 10580 N. McCarran, Building 115-208, Reno, NV 89503. Our telephone number is (713) 542-5161.
