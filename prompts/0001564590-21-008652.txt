Item 1. Business
General 
 Pactiv Evergreen Inc. (“PTVE”, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), a Delaware corporation, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of fresh foodservice and food merchandising products and fresh beverage cartons in North America. We produce a broad range of products that protect, package and display fresh food and beverages for consumers who want to eat or drink fresh, prepared or ready-to-eat food and beverages conveniently and with confidence. We supply our products to a broad and diversified mix of companies, including full service restaurants (“FSRs”) and quick service restaurants (“QSRs”), foodservice distributors, supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers, other food stores, food and beverage producers and food processors. We operate primarily in North America. 
Strategy
 We have a culture that constantly seeks to improve the way we work throughout our business, from our products to our manufacturing and distribution processes to the way we work with our customers. We continually seek to optimize our business through comprehensive business reviews, ideation and targeted strategic initiatives. The review process, identification of focus areas, development of actionable improvement programs and implementation and monitoring of these initiatives are coordinated and managed by our Strategic Project Management Office (the “SPMO”). Our strategic initiatives are grouped into six key areas: growth; value-added customer service; profitable innovation; cost reduction; the integration of Beverage Merchandising and sustainability.

• | Growth: Drive growth of our products and support our customers while maintaining our commitment to quality, reliability, service and safety.

• | Beverage Merchandising. Our Beverage Merchandising segment manufactures cartons for fresh refrigerated beverage products, primarily serving dairy (including plant-based, organic and specialties), juice and other specialty beverage end-markets. Products include integrated fresh carton systems, which include printed cartons with high-impact graphics, spouts and filling machines. Beverage Merchandising also produces fiber-based liquid packaging board for its internal requirements and to sell to other fresh beverage carton manufacturers, as well as a range of paper-based products which it sells to paper and packaging converters. Beverage Merchandising’s customers include dairy, juice and specialty beverage producers, cup, plate and container manufacturers, and other beverage carton manufacturers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We use segment adjusted earnings before income taxes and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 21, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The pie charts below show the breakdown of our net external revenues from continuing operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 by our segments.

 The pie charts below show the breakdown of our net revenues from continuing operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 by our products.
 
Divestitures and Distributions
 The assets, liabilities, results of operations and supplemental cash flow information of substantially all of our Closures business, sold in December 2019, all of our former Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. ("RCPI") segment, distributed in February 2020, and all of our former Graham Packaging Company ("GPC") segment, distributed in September 2020, are presented as discontinued operations for all years presented. For additional details on divestitures and distributions of certain operations that impacted our results, see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Customers
 We supply our products to a broad and diversified mix of companies, including FSRs and QSRs, foodservice distributors, supermarkets, grocery and healthy eating retailers, other food stores, food and beverage producers, food packers and food processors. Our customers range from large blue-chip multinational companies to national and regional companies to small local businesses. We have developed strong and longstanding relationships with our customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2020. Our five largest customers accounted for 28% and our ten largest customers accounted for 37% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2020.
 2


Seasonality
 Our business does not experience high seasonality due to the complementary nature of the seasonal effects on our segments, though portions of our business are moderately seasonal. Our Foodservice and Food Merchandising operations peak during the summer and fall months in North America when the favorable weather, harvest and holiday seasons lead to increased consumption, resulting in greater levels of sales in the second and third quarters. Beverage Merchandising’s customers are principally engaged in providing products that are generally less sensitive to seasonal effects, although Beverage Merchandising does experience some seasonality as a result of increased consumption of milk by school children during the North American academic year, resulting in a greater level of carton product sales in the first and fourth quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Impacting Comparability – COVID-19 within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.
 Competition
 The markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality and price. While we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and we may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all, as pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship. The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. 
Distribution and Marketing
 We have a large well-invested, manufacturing base and a hub-and-spoke distribution network in the United States and in the international geographies in which we operate. The majority of our assets are in the United States, which allows us to provide an extensive offering of products manufactured in the United States to our customers. We believe our manufacturing footprint and distribution network provides us a competitive advantage in each of our segments. Foodservice is the only manufacturer among its competitors in the United States with an extensive nationwide hub-and-spoke distribution network, which enables customers to buy across our entire product offering. Food Merchandising is a low cost U.S. manufacturer with well-invested facilities that are within close proximity to our customer base. We have an unrivalled product offering in the North American foodservice and food merchandising markets and a “one-face-to-the-customer” service model. This service model uses one sales representative per account to produce one order with multiple SKUs supported by one customer service representative that is responsible for one shipment with one invoice. We believe Beverage Merchandising is uniquely positioned in the U.S. and in the emerging markets we serve as the only producer that manufactures fresh beverage cartons, filling machinery and liquid packaging board, which we believe positions us as a low cost solution with excellent customer service. 
 We have made manufacturing flexibility a priority in our investment of capital. We are able to offer substrates and product lines to match changing market needs efficiently and at low cost. This enables us to scale production to match the requirements of our customers and trends in the market, including for example, increasing our use of recycled and recyclable material to produce a greater number of sustainable products and earn higher margins from the sale of these products. We have strategically invested in flexible manufacturing assets that can be quickly converted to produce alternative products. Our broad manufacturing base includes approximately 900 production lines and we manufacture approximately 115 billion units each year. 
 Foodservice has 16 manufacturing plants. Food Merchandising has 24 manufacturing plants. Foodservice and Food Merchandising share the use of 26 warehouses and 8 regional mixing centers. Beverage Merchandising has 6 U.S. beverage carton manufacturing plants, 7 international beverage carton manufacturing plants (including 3 plants in our joint ventures), 2 filling machinery plants, 3 extrusion plants, 2 integrated liquid packaging board and paper mills and 3 chip mills. Each of our manufacturing plants is managed by a manufacturing director, and we utilize lean operating practices and information systems to measure performance against objective metrics to optimize manufacturing efficiency and reduce cost. 
 Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins, fiber (principally raw wood and wood chips) and paperboard (principally cartonboard and cupstock). We also use commodity chemicals, steel and energy, including fuel oil, electricity, natural gas and coal, to manufacture our products. Purchases of most of our raw materials are based on negotiated rates with suppliers, which are tied to published indices. Typically, we do not enter into long-term purchase contracts that provide for fixed quantities or prices for our principal raw materials. For Beverage Merchandising, most raw materials and other input costs are purchased on the spot market. 
 Resin prices have historically fluctuated with changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in refining capacity and the demand for other petroleum-based products. The prices of raw wood and wood chips may fluctuate due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity and commodity market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies and regulations. The cost of our raw materials can also be affected by tariffs, trade sanctions and similar matters that affect international commerce.

We address higher commodity costs through higher product pricing, manufacturing and overhead cost control and hedging. Revenue is directly impacted by changes in raw material costs as a result of raw material cost pass-through mechanisms in many of the customer pricing agreements entered into by our segments. Generally, the contractual price adjustments do not occur simultaneously with commodity price fluctuations, but rather on a mutually agreed upon schedule. Due to differences in timing between purchases of raw materials and sales to customers, there is often a lead-lag effect, during which margins are negatively impacted in the short term when raw material costs increase and positively impacted in the short term when raw material costs decrease. Historically, the average lag time in implementing raw material cost pass-through mechanisms has been approximately three months. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.
 At this time, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. 
 For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to Financial Outlook – Raw Materials and Energy Prices within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Intellectual Property and Research and Development
 We have a proven history of product innovation, including the introduction of new products and the addition of innovative features to existing products. Innovation is a core capability we are proud of and a key focus area going forward as we strive to enhance our product portfolio, drive growth and increase margins. 
 We have significant intellectual property and proprietary know-how. We hold over 400 patents related to product design, utility and material formulations. 
 Our primary focus areas for product innovation are the development of packaging with new value-add features, engineering new materials that improve the performance of our products and commercializing new environmentally-friendly packaging solutions. Both consumer preferences and the requirements of our customers continually evolve and we strive to develop new value-add features and products to meet those needs. Through our long-standing customer relationships, we gain valuable insight into our customers’ needs and are able to identify, engineer and develop the optimal products for them. Functionality, quality, material savings, brand marketing and safety are key drivers in our product development. Examples of our product innovations include reclosable beverage cartons, strawless lids, compostable cutlery and recycled polyethylene terephthalate “PET” containers. 
 In Foodservice, our product innovation initiatives are focused on developing new products made from sustainable materials. In Food Merchandising, our product innovation is focused on rapidly growing emerging companies for whom packaging helps deliver their brand. In Beverage Merchandising, we have developed a variety of carton designs to help beverage manufacturers differentiate their products and generate stronger brand recognition. Our barrier board technology allows our customers to achieve longer shelf life for their products as well as protecting against the loss of vitamins and other nutrients. 
 In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we spent a total of $20 million, $22 million and $19 million, respectively, on research and development efforts. We have dedicated technology and innovation facilities, and we employ personnel focused on product development, material innovation and process improvement. Our material science expertise and state-of-the-art product design and testing capabilities enable us to engineer high-performing materials and create new and innovative products to meet the demanding requirements of our customers and the preferences of consumers as well as to increase food safety. We use our material science expertise to focus on sustainability, performance and material savings. We have an industry-leading analytical lab and dedicated technology center in Canandaigua, New York where we develop innovative resin blending and compounding formulations and processes and new engineered materials using paper/fiber substrates. We also have an innovation center in Bedford Park, Illinois where we have on-site design, testing, prototyping and production capabilities. These unique material and product design capabilities allow us to partner with our customers to rapidly develop and commercialize new and innovative solutions that further increase the value we provide our customers. 
 Regulation
 Our products are formulated and fabricated in compliance with all applicable food laws and regulations. In addition, our production facilities are independently audited for adherence to good manufacturing practices. All North American Beverage Merchandising facilities have received Safe Quality Food (“SQF”) certification, and 22 Foodservice and Food Merchandising facilities have achieved British Retail Consortium (“BRC”) certification for meeting globally-recognized standards related to food safety and quality. Additionally, our paper mills are FSSC 22000-certified, the relevant scheme also related to food safety management.
 We have programs across our businesses to ensure we remain in compliance with all applicable food laws and regulations, as well as compliance with state and local government environmental regulations. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors".

Sustainability and Environmental
 We believe we offer the most extensive selection of eco-friendly fresh food and beverage products in North America that are manufactured from recycled, recyclable or renewable materials and we continue to grow our offering of sustainable products with new bio-resin and fiber-based offerings. We offer customers sustainable alternatives across nearly all of our products and categories today and we believe our EarthChoice brand is the largest eco-friendly foodservice brand with one of the broadest product lines in the North American foodservice industry.
 We offer a broad range of sustainable products that are made with recycled, recyclable or renewable materials. We manufacture an eco-friendly alternative across nearly our entire range of products and offer products made from seven different types of sustainable substrates. Through our state-of-the-art production technology and material science experience, we have the ability to develop new value-add and sustainable solutions. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from changing consumer preferences for more environmentally sustainable products. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 63% of net revenue from continuing operations came from products made from recycled, recyclable or renewable materials, and we have set a goal of having 100% of our net revenue come from such products by 2030.
 In addition, many of our customers have publicly-stated goals to increase the use of sustainable products. A significant portion of our new product and material innovations are geared toward developing sustainable products for our customers. As current customers using traditional materials look to switch to more sustainable alternatives, we are well-positioned to quickly and effectively support them. With a high percentage of our net revenue coming from products that are made from recyclable or other sustainable materials, we are helping our customers achieve their own sustainability goals. 
 In addition to using recyclable and compostable materials, we support efforts to expand opportunities for consumers to recycle or compost our products, notably as one of the founding members of the Carton Council, Paper Recovery Alliance, Plastics Recovery Group, Foam Recycling Coalition and the Paper Cup Alliance. We have demonstrated our commitment to use more recycled plastic by joining the Association for Plastic Recyclers’ Demand Champions program. We engage with the composting industry through the U.S. Composting Council, and a growing number of our products are certified compostable by the Biodegradable Products Institute. We are a longstanding member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, an industry working group dedicated to a more robust environmental vision for packaging. 
 Our dedication to sustainability goes beyond just the products we manufacture. Within our operations, we are working to limit our environmental impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, as well as minimizing water use and decreasing waste going to landfills. We’re focusing on what’s material to our company, and from 2015 to 2019, we achieved a 12% reduction in absolute energy consumption, and a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Improving energy efficiency is critical to us as energy expenses are among our highest cost categories to manufacture our products. We’re also looking to use more renewable energy, which further reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. Today, about half of our annual energy consumption comes from renewable sources including biomass, hydropower, wind and solar.
 Efforts to minimize our water usage takes various forms, given the variety of operations we run. We primarily use water for process operations, cooling and cleaning. The majority of our water use occurs at our two paper mills. Most of our water use is “non-consumptive use,” which means the water is treated and returned back to the environment after being used in our operations.
 Reducing waste in our operations is an ongoing, company-wide pursuit. We reuse a significant majority of plastic and paper scrap back in manufacturing our own products and implement programs to reduce scrap in production as much as possible. The plastic or paper scrap that cannot be reused in the manufacturing process is recycled by other third parties where possible.
 Protecting the sustainability of our forests is a critical initiative, given our broad use of paper through our product offerings. Our Beverage Merchandising business holds third-party certifications from three independent internationally recognized organizations which demonstrates our commitment to responsible forest management, wood procurement procedures and chain-of-custody procedures. In 2020, we were awarded the American Forest & Paper Association’s 2020 Leadership in Sustainability Award for Sustainable Forest Management.
 In September 2020, we issued our 2019-2020 Sustainability Report, which includes expanded reporting on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics and highlights our progress towards our ESG initiatives. 
 Governance
 We have implemented a strong, independent governance program. The composition of our board of directors reflects our commitment to independence. Of the seven members of the board, four are independent members, including two women one of which is also from an underrepresented minority. The chairman of our board of directors is also an independent member.

 Human Capital Resources
 We employed approximately 14,600 people at December 31, 2020. Employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent 31% of our employees. Our operations are subject to various local, national and multinational laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.
Workforce Health and Safety
 We are committed to engaging our employees and communities through a variety of social initiatives centered around safety, leadership and community involvement. Safety is a core value and affects everything we do. Our manufacturing facilities have achieved safety metrics that are approximately three times better than industry average in 2020. We had a total recordable incidence rate of 1.40 compared to the industry average of 3.40, a total lost time rate of 0.97 compared to the industry average of 2.00, and a total lost workday rate of 0.30 compared to an industry average of 0.90. 
Diversity, Inclusion and Talent Development
 We are committed to values of respect for our people and our communities and we focus on attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. For example, we engage our communities and provide leadership opportunities for our employees through our Operations Leadership Development Program and our Leadership Advisory Council. Our Operations Leadership Development Program recruits Junior Military Officers and puts them through an intensive training program to fast-track their transition into manufacturing and logistics leadership roles. Thirty-seven candidates have successfully completed or are currently enrolled in this program and seven are currently Plant Managers or Warehouse Operations Managers. Our Leadership Advisory Council identifies high performing and high potential employees. We also provide these employees with the executive mentorship and guidance needed for them to excel, and we provide them with leadership and strategy development training. This program has been highly successful, with two of our CEO’s direct reports having participated in the program. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies.
