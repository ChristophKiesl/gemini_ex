 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Our mission is to put people at the heart of commerce, empowering everyone to thrive.
 We are a social marketplace that combines the human connection of a physical shopping experience with the scale, reach, ease, and selection benefits of eCommerce. In doing so, we bring the power of community to buying and selling online. We created Poshmark in 2011 to make buying and selling simple, social, and fun. Pairing technology with the inherent human desire to socialize, our marketplace creates passion and personal connections among users. We dynamically curate our marketplace into lifestyle categories that our users love, including apparel, accessories, footwear, home, beauty, and pets. Powered by our proprietary technology, our social marketplace is purpose-built to enable simple transactions, seamless logistics, and an engaging experience at scale. As of December 31, 2021, we had 7.6 million Active Buyers.
 We empower people to sell a few items or to become successful entrepreneurs by providing them with end-to-end seller tools. We refer to this as “making selling a superpower.” Our comprehensive infrastructure makes it easy for sellers, from casual consumers to professional sellers, brands, and retailers, to build their businesses with seamless listing, merchandising, promotion, pricing, and shipping. Sellers use content, inventory selection, and social interactions to monetize their listings. Our transparent fee structure aligns our success with the success of our sellers. Our fee is 20% of the final price for sales $15 and over, or a flat rate of $2.95 for sales under $15. We attract, engage, and retain sellers by creating a vibrant community where sellers can use their personal passion for economic empowerment. We do not own or manage inventory as all products are listed, managed, sold, and shipped by our sellers, utilizing our transaction tools that makes the selling process seamless and easy. This asset-light model creates scalability and favorable working capital dynamics.
 Our social features make the discovery and purchase process simple and enticing for buyers, fostering high engagement and retention. We enable buyers to discover, connect, and curate their network and news feed with that of other users who share similar styles and personal preferences, creating a fun shopping experience. Our marketplace is vast, with sellers listing millions of secondhand and new items across multiple categories. We use data-driven personalization to customize each user’s feed to feature the most relevant listings and make it easy to quickly search for and find products of interest. Furthermore, sellers list a variety of items across all price points, with the added benefit of being able to negotiate offers directly with buyers seeking to optimize their budget, allowing sellers to manage their listings to achieve their individual objectives. Because our marketplace features a massive selection of secondhand items, buyers are also able to support their personal style while minimizing their environmental impact.
 The scale of our community of users, buyers, and sellers creates network effects that drive growth in our social marketplace. We make it easy for buyers and sellers to build and deepen relationships through a variety of social mechanisms designed to foster social interactions, create community, and drive engagement. As users join our community, they interact with one another and build personal networks through likes, comments, shares, follows, offers, and purchases. This engagement attracts new sellers who, in turn, increase the breadth and depth on our marketplace, and ultimately attract more buyers. Buyers often convert to becoming sellers after experiencing the ease and value of selling on our marketplace. At any time, a user may be a buyer, a seller, or both. This high velocity flywheel of community engagement drives strong monetization potential and an attractive business model with efficient user acquisition dynamics.
 Proprietary technology and data underpin our community, social marketplace, logistics, and payments. Our eCommerce technology allows seamless, secure transaction capabilities in a highly distributed network across millions of buyers and sellers, without having to touch or own physical inventory. We rely on data science to personalize every user’s feed while offering powerful, easy to use tools to drive seller success. The result is a unique ecosystem built for social commerce, which leverages social tools to humanize the online shopping experience and harnesses community engagement, while providing an integrated end-to-end system across the transaction cycle, from shopping to shipping.

Future of Online Shopping is Social
 While eCommerce offers substantial improvements to buyers over in-person shopping, namely the unparalleled scale and diversity of brands, styles, and price points, the personalization element remains a challenge. The sheer scale of online inventory can often overwhelm potential customers. Despite some advances in personalization, the online buyer experience is still largely one-way and transactional.
 In the offline shopping experience, product discovery is inherently social. Shoppers are seeking the same in the digital world and increasingly turn to one another for recommendations and validation online. Social technology platforms take a central role in facilitating personal, meaningful interactions at scale through photos and discovery-based content. In addition, consumers increasingly favor resale shopping, fueled by the desire for sustainable consumption and increased orientation towards value. From the seller perspective, people continue to find ways to pursue their passions with a digital “side-hustle” or as digital entrepreneurs. The growing demand for social shopping online creates a meaningful opportunity for sellers to expand their potential customer base from local to global, with the data-driven ability to reach, acquire, and retain buyers.
 The Poshmark Solution
 Poshmark makes buying and selling simple, social, and sustainable.
 Benefits to Buyers
 Social and fun. Our shopping experience flourishes because of authentic human connection. We enable our buyers to grow their personal networks on our marketplace, driving positive social feedback, long-term engagement, and repeat purchases. Our community builds relationships through a variety of social actions and encourages sellers to style and promote each other’s items. Through Likes, Posh Parties, conversations, styling “Bundles,” and negotiations, we have brought the benefits of the real-world shopping experience online.
 Simple and personalized. Our marketplace makes shopping and buying easy and accessible. Users can access our marketplace on numerous devices, with a simple payment and shipping process and a consistent buying experience across the platform. Buyers can benefit from personalized experiences with sellers who understand their individual style, sizing, and fit. Our sellers offer a vast assortment of items and we offer the data-driven ability to sift through all of it and personalize the experience for each user. Sellers often send personal, handwritten notes to buyers along with their item, while buyers often write digital “love notes,” commenting on the purchase or seller experience.
 Value shopping with breadth and depth. Our marketplace allows buyers to optimize the best value for them. Sellers offer a vast assortment of secondhand and new items at value price points enabling shoppers to easily find and purchase any style, including everyday items as well as hard-to-find items. The average order value on our marketplace in 2021 was $40, up from $35 in 2020.
 Win-win for environment and enduring style. Shopping on our marketplace allows members of our community to support their commitment to environmental sustainability across multiple products and brands that fit their personal style. We believe this trend will grow, in particular as the next generation of consumers age and have growing disposable income.
Benefits to Sellers
 Easy and simple to rotate a closet or build and grow a business. End-to-end tools make selling a superpower through robust listing, fulfillment, and customer support capabilities. Underpinned by our proprietary technology, our millions of sellers can easily list their inventory in real time and connect with buyers. We offer an integrated stack for running a full-scale online shop from a mobile phone, supported by end-to-end marketplace tools for order fulfillment. The simplicity of this selling experience makes it possible for anyone to engage with buyers and sell on our marketplace, whether it is individuals cleaning out their closets, professional sellers building their own brands, local boutiques expanding online, merchants engaging other merchants, or brands and retailers building their online social store presence.

Ability to build a personal brand and loyal customers. Sellers use their personal passion to feature content, select and style inventory, and engage in social interactions to monetize their listings and drive the growth of their businesses. Sellers can create a personal brand and ongoing relationships with buyers on our marketplace, and this social feedback helps keep sellers engaged. This is a powerful feature of our marketplace and has enabled entrepreneurial sellers to launch their businesses and build their own brands quickly and cost effectively, while empowering brands and retailers to deepen their interaction and engagement with our loyal customer base.
 Built-in demand based on community scale and engagement. As our business has grown, we have invested in new technology and capabilities to allow our sellers to reach and engage with more users and buyers. We market and enable sellers to market their items through social tools so that sellers do not need to spend money on marketing to drive traffic to their listings.
Transparent business model and pricing. Our business model is simple. We make money when our sellers make money on our marketplace. We charge a transparent fee based on the final sale price of an item: 20% of the final price for sales $15 and over, or a flat rate of $2.95 for sales under $15. There are no other fees that the seller pays to sell on our marketplace.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages that will enable us to maintain and expand our position as a leading social marketplace, including:
 •Diverse, highly engaged, and loyal community built on genuine human connection. Our community is diverse and spans age and geography in the United States, Canada, Australia, and India. Our users live in big cities and small towns and engage with each other across geographies to discover, list, buy, and sell items across all price points. 
 •Vast, curated social marketplace. By making it easy for anyone to sell, our marketplace can offer a vast and diverse collection of resale and new items. Our sellers offer a wide variety of items and provide a uniquely curated, constantly refreshed selection that they share with our community. Our algorithms personalize each user’s feed to feature the most relevant listings. Buyers can also quickly and easily search for specific items or categories. The dynamic nature of the product listings on our marketplace and the freshness of the curated assortments by our sellers further increase engagement on our marketplace. 
 •End-to-end social marketplace services provide a seamless buying and selling experience. Our end-to-end solutions are designed to connect buyers with sellers, promote listings, enable easy shipping, and grow sales. We provide buyers with the ability to meaningfully engage with sellers via socially curated content, video sharing capabilities, personal styling, and price negotiation. We also offer comprehensive marketplace services that make it seamless for sellers to grow their businesses on our marketplace. New listing creation, a simple and transparent fee structure, marketing and merchandising support, shipping management, sales reporting, and order management tools provide important value to our sellers, particularly those who seek to grow a successful small business on our marketplace.
 •Proprietary technology and data platform designed to enable social interactions and transactions at scale. We have built our proprietary technology and data platform from the ground up and designed it to enable social interactions and transactions at scale, across iOS, Android, and on the web. We have built a complex social graph that helps power each user’s experience on our marketplace. Additionally, our technology allows for real-time updates, with the Poshmark feed refreshing in real time throughout the day with the new products, social updates, and recent deals.
 •Supports sustainability. We believe that our marketplace can be a force for social good and drive more sustainable consumption. Consumers, in particular younger generations, are increasingly focused on sustainability. We deliver on this desire for sustainability by promoting resale, while also helping consumers to make and save money and fuel small business entrepreneurship.
 •Visionary, founder-driven management team with complementary strengths. Poshmark is a social marketplace built on love and community. Since day one, this has been the vision of our founders and management team and remains the core tenant of our brand. Furthermore, we prioritize diversity of 

experience, thought, and background throughout our entire team, to ensure a breadth of complementary skill sets.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Community is the engine of our business, and our main priority is ensuring that this community continues to grow and transact. Our community provides both the supply and the demand on our social marketplace, which is critical to our success. We are therefore focused on expanding the community and fostering the best environment possible for a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience. We focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:
 •Grow our community of Active Users. New users bring incremental social engagement, listings, and transactions to all users, which leads to a virtuous cycle—the more Active Users on our platform, the more powerful the network effect. Not only are we focused on growing the community in number, but also in diversity which directly feeds into the breadth of products and social interactions offered on our marketplace.
 •Add new product categories. We organize all of the products on our marketplace into distinct, shoppable categories. Women’s was our first category, followed by our launch of Men’s and Kid’s in 2016. Plus and Petite Sizes were added in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we added the Home category, in 2020, we added the Beauty and Toys categories, and in 2021, we added the Pets and Electronics categories. We anticipate adding new categories to expand our product offering and continue to serve demand from our diverse community.
 
•Drive innovation to increase engagement and enhance the marketplace. There is a strong correlation between the overall level of engagement on our platform and the frequency of transactions. As a result, we are focused on increasing engagement on our marketplace by adding new discovery elements and continuing to make social interaction with other users simple, useful, and fun. We plan to continue to innovate to increase engagement and make selling easier on our marketplace.
 
•Offer high impact enterprise seller services. Sellers are drawn to our social marketplace because we empower them to succeed. The more we invest in our marketplace, the more we enable our sellers to grow and scale their businesses efficiently, reaching a vast and diverse user base. We intend to enhance our enterprise selling services and continue to attract professional sellers, brands, and retailers to participate on our social marketplace.
 
•Expand internationally. The more people we can reach, the greater the benefit to our users. We have designed our global infrastructure to serve a multitude of countries with minimal local support. We believe our marketplace can be successful in additional geographies outside of the United States and Canada, and we plan to strategically expand globally in the future. In 2021, we expanded our operations to Australia and India.
 The Poshmark Social Marketplace
 Our User Experience—Driving Engagement Through Social Interactions
 We believe that commerce on our marketplace is fundamentally driven by the engagement of our community. To harness this engagement, we have built a set of tools and features that are designed to drive broad user reach, while enabling our users to interact and engage with each other in meaningful ways throughout our platform.

Key social features on our app include:
 •Share. Sharing a listing is a way to feature an item to a broad audience within the community. Users can share their own listings and those of other Poshmark users, spreading engagement exponentially.
 •Like. A user is able to like any listing in our marketplace. When a user likes an item, the seller is notified of their interest and the like is archived so that the user can review or revisit the item at any point in time.
 •Follow. Users can follow each other in our marketplace to expand their presence and network.
 •Comment. Users can leave comments for sellers on their listings. This enables sellers to promptly respond to customer inquiries, which builds community engagement and drives conversion.
 •Offer. Offers are a common way for buyers and sellers to negotiate the purchase price of an item and are a critical tool for price discovery. Both buyers and sellers have the ability to make an offer and it is a core engagement mechanism to draw users back to our marketplace.
 •Posh Parties. Posh Parties are time and category-focused virtual events for our community, organized by Poshmark, where curated and relevant listings are shared.
 Our Seller Services—Making Selling a Superpower
 We believe that anyone can become a successful seller on our marketplace. We have built a broad set of tools that make selling simple and seamless, because we think selling should be a superpower. These tools harness the massive reach and engagement of our community and support selling end-to-end, from the listing process and marketing to fulfillment and customer support.
 End-to-end marketing and selling features for sellers include:
 Storefront Services: Our seller services help professionalize all sellers with their own unique storefronts.
 •Listing. Sellers can list items for sale in a quick, simple, and free process that only takes a few minutes. Sellers upload images of an item and can include listing information around size, color, condition, brand, and pricing. The listing is broadcasted to all of the seller’s followers and can be connected directly to other social platforms and search engines, increasing user reach and engagement.
 •Pricing. Sellers control the pricing of their listings and manage buyer negotiations. Sellers have the option to offer dynamic pricing or targeted discounts.
 •Wholesale. We provide sellers the opportunity to purchase inventory in bulk for sale in their stores via Posh Wholesale. 
 Social Marketing Services: Sellers can engage with users and promote their listings through our Social Marketing Services. These services add a deeply personal element to the online shopping experience, leveraging social actions to deepen engagement and ultimately drive transactions.
 •Posh Stories. Posh Stories enable sellers to showcase and sell their listings in short videos and photos that disappear in 48 hours. 
 •Bundles. Sellers can create a storewide seller discount to entice buyers to buy more than one item.
 •Drops Soon. Sellers can pre-market items with Drops Soon, a tool that allows sellers to list items that are not yet available for purchase.
 •Reposh. With the Reposh feature, sellers have a simple, one-click way to resell items bought on our marketplace.
 
Logistics and Payment Services: We provide a full range of logistics and payment support services, including shipping, payment, and authentication to ensure that both buying and selling are seamless.
 •Shipping. Through Posh Post, sellers have an easy and fast shipping solution to fulfill a transaction. In the U.S., buyers pay a flat fee to ship any item with the United States Postal Service, or the USPS, up to five 

pounds, regardless of size, price, or location. Sellers receive a pre-paid, pre-populated shipping label directly from Poshmark when an item is sold to facilitate shipping.
 
•Payment. We provide users with transaction processing, offering buyers a variety of payment methods, including credit card and Posh Credits, and providing sellers with payment remittance as quickly as 2-3 days.
 
•Authentication. We facilitate trust on our marketplace through features such as Posh Protect, where buyers can request refunds if an item is not as described, and Posh Authenticate, a physical authentication service offered at no charge for each item sold at $500 or more.
 Customer Support Services: We provide ongoing customer support through our Community Services team, whether it is before or after a transaction. Our support services include dispute management, credit services, post order communication, and overweight package management.
 Heart and Hustle Community Fund: Our Heart and Hustle Community Fund, which provides small grants to select sellers to support their business goals, is one way we recognize Poshmark sellers who are looking to grow their businesses on our social marketplace.
 Competition
 We face competition for both our buyers and our sellers from a wide range of competitors, which include both online or offline retailers, such as large marketplaces, national retail chains, local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces. These competitors include, but are not limited to, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Facebook, Mercari, Shopify, T.J.Maxx, and Walmart. We believe that our competition falls into two categories:
 •Buying and Selling Merchandise. We compete for shopping market share across both new and resale merchandise. New merchandise consists of both items sold directly by manufacturers and retailers and examples of competitors include online and offline general retailers and specialty retailers. Resale merchandise consists of items that have been previously purchased and used and examples of competition include online and offline specialty retailers dedicated to resale merchandise, and informal, peer-to-peer venues for selling used items.
 
•Discovery and Engagement. We also face competition from social media sites and commerce enablement companies that provide other outlets for engagement time spent. For instance, social media sites that are not specifically dedicated to commerce, as well as offline gatherings that are focused on shopping.
 We believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively based on the experience and tools that we provide to sellers and buyers, awareness of our brand, and the social nature of our marketplace.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand and technology, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of international and domestic registered, pending and common law trademarks to protect our brand and, as of December 31, 2021, we own trademark registrations for “Poshmark” and the Poshmark logo in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions.
 As of December 31, 2021, we own three issued patents in the United States, which are expected to expire as early as 2035, in each case assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. We additionally own two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications. These pending U.S. patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire as early as 2038, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary
rights agreements with our employees and independent contractors. Our employees are also generally subject to invention assignment agreements. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.”
 Human Capital
 Employees
 Our human capital resources objective is to build amazing teams and foster a culture that is anchored by our values of focusing on people, leading with love, growing together, and embracing our weirdness.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 750 full-time employees of which 248 were in research and development, 88 were in marketing, 333 were in operations and support, and 81 were in general and administrative. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Compensation & Benefits
  Our reward programs are designed to attract, motivate, and retain great people who are passionate about our mission, drive our business forward, and create value for our stakeholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary, short-term incentives and long-term incentives that are reviewed on an annual basis. Our comprehensive benefits package also includes medical, dental, vision, life, and disability plans, as well as lifestyle benefits such as parental leave.
Employee Safety and Wellness
 We are committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of our employees. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our corporate offices and transitioned the majority of our employees to remote work. To support the remote working environment, we implemented a program where employees have a monthly allowance that can be used to cover certain expenses related to health, wellness, and productivity. We also launched mental health benefits to support our employees’ wellbeing. For our facilities that remain open, we have implemented safety standards based on guidance from public health authorities. For those who can work remotely, we will continue to offer work location flexibility throughout the 2022 year as the COVID-19 situation remains in flux. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation of COVID-19 and take all necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of our employees, operations, and community.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce that is reflective of the community we serve. We strive to build a strong talent pipeline to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and support greater representation with our company. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERG) program empowers our employees to build internal communities, champion inclusion and belonging, and create development opportunities. We have also developed more robust demographic data to measure progress in the hiring and development of underrepresented communities and historically marginalized groups. In 2021, we further diversified our executive leadership team and board of directors by recruiting and hiring diverse candidates from underrepresented groups. We also implemented unconscious bias education for all employees to support our goals of diversity and inclusion.
