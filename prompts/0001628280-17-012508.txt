ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General 
ABM Industries Incorporated, which operates through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “ABM,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is a leading provider of integrated facility solutions with a mission to make a difference, every person, every day. Our history dates back to 1909, when American Building Maintenance Company began as a window washing company in San Francisco with one employee. In 1985, we were incorporated in Delaware under the name American Building Maintenance Industries, Inc., as the successor to the business originally founded in 1909. In 1994, we changed our name to ABM Industries Incorporated. Over the past ten years, we have grown into a multi-segment facility solutions company, particularly through new service offerings and strategic acquisitions:
The acquisition of OneSource in 2007 bolstered ABM as a leader in the janitorial market, while the Linc Group acquisition in 2010 established ABM as a “facility solutions” company with new service offerings, including lighting, mechanical, and electrical “technical solutions.” With demand increasing for industry-specific service providers, in 2012 we purchased Air Serv and established our first industry group, “aviation,” which was previously included in “other.” In recent years, we have strategically acquired companies in the U.K., particularly with the GBM and Westway acquisitions, which expanded overseas both our janitorial and technical solutions businesses. In 2017, we completed the acquisition of GCA Services, a provider of integrated facility services to educational institutions and commercial facilities for $1.3 billion, the largest acquisition in ABM history. As a result of this acquisition, we are now a leading facility solutions provider in the education market. In recent years, we also evaluated all of our service offerings and sold our Security and Government Services businesses as they did not align with ABM’s long-term industry-group focus. 
As a result of these strategic acquisitions, we have strengthened our ability to offer janitorial, facilities engineering, parking, and specialized mechanical and electrical technical solutions, on a standalone basis or in combination, and positioned ourselves as a leading integrated facilities management company. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31. 
2020 Vision
In September 2015, we announced a comprehensive transformation initiative (“2020 Vision”) intended to drive long-term profitable growth through an industry-based go-to-market approach. Our 2020 Vision involves three phases: During Phase 1, which we completed on November 1, 2016, we realigned our organization; in Phase 2, which is continuing today, we are focused on improvements to our operational framework to promote efficiencies and process enhancements; and in Phase 3, on the foundation of benefits realized from Phases 1 and 2, we anticipate accelerating growth with our industry-based, go-to-market service model. For additional information on our 2020 Vision, see Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Contract Types
We generate revenues under several types of contracts, as explained below. Generally, the type of contract is determined by the nature of the services. Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a high client retention rate and expect to continue maintaining long-term relationships with our clients. 

Contract Type | Description 
Monthly Fixed-Price | These arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month over a specified contract term. A variation of a fixed-price arrangement is a square-foot arrangement, under which monthly billings are based on the actual square footage serviced. Janitorial contracts are commonly structured as fixed-price arrangements.
Cost-Plus | These arrangements are contracts in which the clients reimburse us for the agreed-upon amount of wages and benefits, payroll taxes, insurance charges, and other expenses associated with the contracted work, plus a profit margin. Facilities engineering, janitorial, and catering services are commonly structured as cost-plus arrangements. 
Tag Services | Tag work generally consists of supplemental services requested by clients outside of the standard service specification. This contract type is commonly used in janitorial services and includes cleanup after tenant moves, construction cleanup, flood cleanup, and snow removal. 
Transaction-Price | These are agreements in which the clients are billed for each transaction performed on a monthly basis (e.g., wheelchair passengers served or aircrafts cleaned). 
Hourly | These arrangements are contracts in which the client is billed a set hourly rate for each labor hour provided. Certain Aviation contracts are structured as hourly arrangements. 
Management Reimbursement | Under these parking arrangements, we manage a parking facility for a management fee and pass through the revenue and expenses associated with the facility to the owner. 
Leased Location | Under these parking arrangements, we generally pay to the property owner a fixed amount of rent, plus a percentage of revenues derived from monthly and transient parkers. We retain all revenues and we are responsible for most operating expenses incurred. 
Allowance | Under these parking arrangements, we are paid a fixed or hourly fee to provide parking services, and we are responsible for certain operating expenses, as specified in the contract. 
Energy Savings Contracts and Fixed-Price Repair and Refurbishment | Under these arrangements, we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct a project and guarantee that the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. 
Franchise | We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions. 

Segment and Geographic Financial Information
For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are currently separated into five reportable segments: Business & Industry (“B&I”), Aviation, Emerging Industries Group, Technical Solutions, and the newly acquired GCA Services. Among other changes, once we integrate GCA into our industry group model in 2018, we anticipate our Education industry group will become a reportable segment. We also expect to present a new Technology & Manufacturing reportable segment, that will combine our High Tech industry group and the legacy GCA and ABM Industrial & Manufacturing (“I&M”) businesses. ABM’s legacy I&M business was included in the B&I segment. Our principal operations are in the United States, and in 2017 our U.S. operations generated approximately 94% of our revenues. For segment and geographical financial information, see Note 18, “Segment and Geographic Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ONGOING REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND DESCRIPTIONS
 | B&I, our largest reportable segment, encompasses janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for commercial real estate properties, sports and entertainment venues, and industrial and manufacturing sites. We typically provide these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through a competitive bid process. 
 | Aviation supports airlines and airports with services ranging from parking and janitorial to passenger assistance, catering, air cabin maintenance, and transportation. We typically provide services to clients in this segment under master services agreements. These agreements are typically re-bid upon renewal and are generally structured as fixed-price arrangements, parking reimbursement contracts, transaction-price arrangements, and hourly arrangements. Two clients accounted for approximately 35% of revenues for this segment in 2017.
 | Our Emerging Industries Group is comprised of our Education, Healthcare, and High Tech industry groups. Services include janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for clients in these industries. The Emerging Industries Group typically provides these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through a competitive bid process. 
 | Technical Solutions provides specialized mechanical and electrical services. These services can also be leveraged for cross-selling within B&I, Aviation, and the Emerging Industries Group, both domestically and internationally. Contracts for this segment are structured as cost-plus arrangements, fixed-price arrangements, energy savings contracts, and franchise arrangements. 
 | GCA Services is a provider of integrated facility services to educational institutions and commercial facilities. It typically provides these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through a competitive bid process. 

Service Marks, Trademarks, and Trade Names
We hold various service marks, trademarks, and trade names, such as “ABM,” “ABM Building Value,” “ABM Greencare,” “MPower,” “Linc Service,” and “TEGG,” which we deem important to our marketing activities, our business, and, with respect to certain of these, the franchising activities conducted by our Technical Solutions segment.
Dependence on Significant Client
No client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2017, 2016, or 2015.

Competition
We believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We mainly compete with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with competitive advantages in those regards. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing activities include digital engagement and direct interactions with prospective and existing clients, pricing, proposal management, and customer relationship management by dedicated business development teams, operations personnel, and management. These activities are executed by branch and regional sales, marketing, and operations teams assigned to our industry groups and are supported by centralized sales support teams, inside sales teams, corporate marketing personnel, and our Center of Excellence teams. These sales and marketing teams perform lead acquisition, lead nurturing, and lead management as well as training in sales tools and proposal systems, all governed by standard operating procedures. 
Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water, and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. From time to time we are involved in environmental matters at certain of our locations or in connection with our operations. Historically, the cost of complying with environmental laws or resolving environmental issues relating to locations or operations in the United States or abroad has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Employees
As of October 31, 2017, we employed approximately 140,000 employees, of which approximately 44,000, or 32%, were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements.

We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
