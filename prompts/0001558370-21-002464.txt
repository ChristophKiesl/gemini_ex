ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Certain prior year financial statements are not comparable to our current year financial statements due to the adoption of fresh start accounting. References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to November 19, 2020. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, November 19, 2020.
FTS International, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”) is one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in North America. We have 1.4 million total hydraulic horsepower across 28 fleets, with 13 fleets active as of January 1, 2021. Our customers include leading oil and natural gas E&P companies in North America. We operate in some of the most active oil and gas basins in the United States.
​
​
We provide the equipment, personnel, expertise, and certain materials needed to stimulate our customers’ wells safely, effectively, and efficiently. In addition, we manufacture many of the components used by our fleets, including fabrication of pumps and certain consumables used in pumps, such as fluid-ends. We also perform substantially all the maintenance, repair, and refurbishment of our fleets, including the rebuilding of engines and transmissions. We believe the cost to manufacture components and refurbish fleets is significantly less than the cost of utilizing third-party suppliers. In addition, we believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities allow us to reactivate equipment quicker and at a lower cost than utilizing third-party suppliers.
We have a uniform fleet of high-horsepower hydraulic fracturing equipment, designed for completions work in areas requiring high levels of pressure, flow rate and sand intensity. We designed and assembled all of our existing fleets 

1



using internal resources. The standardized, “plug and play” nature of our fleet provides us with several advantages, including reduced repair and maintenance costs, reduced inventory costs, reduced training, the ability to redeploy equipment among operating basins and reduced complexity in our operations, which improves our safety and operational performance.
Recent Developments
Bankruptcy Update
On September 22, 2020, FTS International, Inc., FTS International Services, LLC, and FTS International Manufacturing, LLC filed petitions for voluntary relief (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On September 22, 2020, FTSI International, Inc., FTS International Services, LLC, and FTS International Manufacturing, LLC filed the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of FTS International, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates (as amended, modified or supplemented, the “Plan”) and the related disclosure statement (the “Disclosure Statement”). On November 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Plan, as modified by the Confirmation Order, and approving the Disclosure Statement.
On November 19, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and FTS International, Inc., FTS International Services, LLC and FTS International Manufacturing, LLC emerged from Chapter 11. Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, all agreements, instruments, and other documents evidencing, relating to or otherwise in connection with any of our common stock or other equity interests outstanding prior to the Effective Date (collectively, the “legacy equity interests”) were cancelled and such legacy equity interests have no further force or effect after the Effective Date. Holders of our legacy equity interests received (i) a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to their proportionate distribution of approximately 9.4% of our common stock under the Plan (subject to dilution by the warrants issued pursuant to the Plan and the Amended and Restated Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “MIP”)), (ii) their proportionate distribution of 1,555,521 Tranche 1 Warrants to acquire Class A common stock and (iii) their proportionate distribution of 3,888,849 Tranche 2 Warrants to acquire Class A common stock.
In addition, pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, all outstanding obligations under the 6.25% senior secured notes due May 1, 2022 (the “Notes”) and were cancelled and the indenture governing such obligations was cancelled, and the credit agreement, dated as of April 16, 2014, by and among FTS International, Inc., the lenders party thereto, and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as successor administrative agent (the “Term Loan Agreement”), was cancelled, in each case except to the limited extent expressly set forth in the Plan. On the Effective Date, all liens and security interests granted to secure such obligations were automatically terminated and are of no further force and effect. The holders of Notes and holders of the claims under the Term Loan Agreement received their proportionate distribution of approximately 90.1% of our common stock (subject to dilution by the warrants issued pursuant to the Plan and the MIP) plus their pro rata share of $30.7 million cash distribution. The holders of claims in connection with the termination of the supply agreement between the Predecessor and Covia Holding Corporation received, in exchange for their claims, a $12.5 million cash distribution and 0.5% of our common stock (subject to dilution by the warrants issued pursuant to the Plan and the MIP).
Shares of Class A common stock were also issued to a holder of certain termination claims under the Plan.
Our Services
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our primary business is providing hydraulic fracturing services, also known as pressure pumping, to E&P companies. These services enhance hydrocarbon flow in oil and natural gas wells, thus increasing the amount of hydrocarbons recovered.

2



Oil and natural gas wells are typically divided into one or more “stages,” which are isolated zones that focus the high-pressure fluid and proppant from the hydraulic fracturing fleet into distinct portions of the well and surrounding reservoir. The number of stages that will divide a well is determined by the customer’s proposed job design. Our customers typically measure our operational performance in terms of the number of stages fractured or the number of hours pumped in a day, which is an indicator of how well we minimize non-productive time on our jobs. As a result, we believe the average number of stages completed per active fleet in a given period of time is an important operating metric.
Hydraulic fracturing represents the largest cost of completing an oil or natural gas well. The process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to fracture, or prop open, the formation. The fracturing fluid consists of water and sand, also known as proppant, mixed with a small amount of chemicals. Once the pressure opens the fractures, the proppants act as a wedge that keep the fractures open, allowing the trapped hydrocarbons to flow more freely. As a result of a successful fracturing process, hydrocarbon recovery rates are substantially enhanced, increasing the return on investment for our customer. The amount of hydrocarbons produced from a typical oil or natural gas well generally declines quickly. As a result, E&P companies must continually complete new wells to maintain production levels.
Each of our fleets typically consists of approximately 20 hydraulic fracturing units along with ancillary equipment. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high-pressure pump, a diesel or combined diesel and natural gas engine, a transmission and various other supporting equipment mounted on a trailer. The high pressure pump consists of two key assemblies: the fluid-end and the power-end. Although the power-end of our pumps generally lasts several years, the fluid-end, which is the part of the pump where fluid is converted from low pressure to high pressure, is a shorter-lasting consumable, typically lasting less than one year. We refer to the group of hydraulic fracturing units, auxiliary equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” Our fleets operate on a 24-hour-per-day basis, in which we typically staff three crews per fleet, including one crew with the day off.
Each hydraulic fracturing fleet includes a mobile, on-site control center that is used to control the equipment and monitor job data including pressures, rates and volumes. Each control center is equipped with high bandwidth communication that provides continuous upload and download of data. The data is delivered on a real-time basis to on-site job personnel, the customer and our National Operations Center.
We prefer to enter into service agreements with our customers for one or more “dedicated” fleets, rather than providing our fleets for “spot work.” Under a typical dedicated fleet agreement, we deploy one or more of our hydraulic fracturing fleets exclusively to the customer to follow the customer’s completion schedule until the agreement expires or is terminated in accordance with its terms. By contrast, under a typical spot work agreement, the fleet moves between customers as work becomes available. We believe that our strategy of pursuing dedicated fleet agreements leads to higher fleet utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month, which we believe improves our revenue and profitability.

Our Strategy 
Our primary business objective is to deliver best in class pressure pumping services to our customers while providing a safe working environment for our employees and maintaining a competitive cost structure. We intend to achieve this objective through the following strategies:
Deepen and expand relationships with customers that value our completions efficiency
We prefer to dedicate one or more of our fleets exclusively to the customer for a period of time, allowing for those fleets to be integrated into the customer’s drilling and completion schedule. As a result, we are able to achieve higher levels of utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month and the number of hours each fleet is working each day, which increases our profitability. Accordingly, we seek to partner with customers that have a large number of wells needing completion and that value efficiency in the performance of our service. Specifically, we target customers whose completions activity typically involves minimal time between stages, a high 

3



number of stages per well, multiple wells per pad and a short distance from one well pad site to the next. This strategy aligns with the strategy of many of our customers, who are trying to achieve a manufacturing-style model of drilling and completing wells at a competitive cost. We plan to leverage this strategy to expand our relationships with our existing and prospective customers.
Capitalize on our uniform fleet and in-house manufacturing to provide superior performance with reduced operating costs
Our uniform fleet allows us to cost-effectively redeploy fleets to capture the best pricing and activity trends. The uniform fleet is easier to operate and maintain, resulting in reduced non-productive time as well as lower training costs and inventory stocking requirements.
Our in-house manufacturing allows us to maintain and refurbish our fleets, with lower operating expenses and capital expenditures compared to utilizing third-party suppliers. We also believe this capability allows us to reactivate equipment quicker and at a lower cost than competitors, which we believe at times is a competitive advantage.
Maintain high safety standards
Safety is at the core of our operations and defines who we are and how we operate as a company. Our safety record for 2020 was the best in our history and we believe significantly better than our peer group, based on data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2011 through 2018. Our 2020 Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) was 0.20 and Lost Time Incident Rate (“LTIR”) was 0.00 for a total of 2,035,023 man hours worked. Our outstanding Experience Modification Rate for 2020 was 0.58. We believe that our TRIR is about one-fourth the industry average and our LTIR has averaged several times lower than the industry average for the past decade. We believe continually searching for ways to make our operations safer is the right thing to do for our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and our Company.
Rapidly adopt new technologies in a capital efficient manner
Our large scale and culture of innovation allow us to take advantage of leading technological solutions. We have been a fast adopter of new technologies focused on: increasing fracturing effectiveness for our customers, reducing non-productive time on our equipment, reducing the operating costs of our equipment, and enhancing the health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) conditions at our well sites. 
Recent examples of initiatives aimed at reducing our operating costs include: vibration sensors with predictive maintenance analytics on our equipment; automated greasing systems; remote start capabilities; the ability to automate certain portions of our operations using technology; and adoption of hardened alloys for our consumables. Recent examples of initiatives aimed at improving our HSE conditions include: dual fuel engines that can run on both natural gas and diesel fuel; electronic pressure relief systems; spill prevention and containment solutions; electronic logging devices; containerized proppant delivery solutions; and advanced fire suppression systems.
Maintain a focus on cost effectiveness and capital efficiency
All levels of our organization focus on providing the safest work environment for our employees and on generating the highest level of cash generation as possible, within the limitations of industry conditions.
We focus on operating our equipment at the highest level of efficiency to maximize billing activity for each of our fleets, which is often measured in terms of stages completed per active fleet. In turn, we strive to charge a competitive rate to our customers and to be compensated for the high level of efficiency that we provide. This ultimately leads to lower costs for our customers.
In addition, we embrace innovation to continually find ways to lower the costs of doing business. This is enabled by our culture and our in-house manufacturing capabilities, which allow us to continuously identify and execute improvements in the design and operation of our equipment.

Customers
The customers we serve are primarily large, independent E&P companies in North America. For the Successor period of November 20, 2020 to December 31, 2020 we had 6 customers make up over 10% of our consolidated revenue. These six customers represented 81% of our consolidated revenue; this level of customer concentration is partially due to the short time period included in the Successor period and may not be representative of customer concentration levels over a longer time period, such as a full fiscal year. For the Predecessor period of January 1, 2020 through November 19, 2020 we had one customer make up over 10% of our consolidated revenue. This customer represented 12% of our consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we had two customers make up over 10% of our consolidated revenue. These two customers represented 26% of our consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we had two customers make up over 10% of our consolidated revenue. These two customers represented 24% of our consolidated revenue. The loss of any of our largest existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While we view revenue as an important metric in assessing customer concentration, we also compare and manage our customer portfolio based on the number of fleets we place with each customer.
Suppliers
We purchase parts used in the refurbishment, repair and manufacturing of major fleet components such as fluid-ends, power-ends, engines, transmissions, radiators and trailers. We do not expect significant interruptions in the supply of any of these materials. While we believe that we will be able to make alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these items, there can be no assurance that there will be no associated price or supply issues.
When requested by the customer, we also purchase the proppants and chemicals we use in our operations and the diesel fuel for our equipment from a variety of suppliers throughout the United States. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis at competitive prices. In the past, we have experienced some delays in obtaining these materials during periods of high demand.
Competition
The market in which we operate is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Our competition includes multi-national oilfield service companies as well as national and regional competitors. Our major multi-national competitors is Halliburton Company, which has significantly greater financial resources than we do. Our major domestic competitors are NextTier Oilfield Solutions, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp, Liberty Oilfield Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., and Pro Frac Services. Certain of these competitors provide a number of oilfield services and products in addition to hydraulic fracturing. We also face competition from smaller regional service providers in some of the geographies in which we operate.
Competition in our industry is based on a number of factors, including price, service quality, safety, and in some cases, breadth of products. We believe we consistently deliver exceptional service quality, based in part on the durability of our equipment. Our durable equipment reduces non-productive time due to equipment failure and allows our customers to avoid costs associated with delays in completing their wells. By being able to meet the most demanding pressure and flow rate requirements, our equipment also enables us to operate efficiently in challenging geological environments in which some of our competitors cannot operate effectively.
Cyclical Nature of Industry 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry driven mainly by the level of horizontal drilling activity in the United States, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production decline rates. A critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the supply and demand for both oil and natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to large and rapid fluctuations. These fluctuations are driven by commodity demand and corresponding price increases. When oil and natural gas prices increase, producers could increase their capital expenditures, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. However, increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production, which historically, has resulted in 

5



increased supplies and reduced prices that, in turn, tend to reduce demand for oilfield services such as hydraulic fracturing services. 
The pricing for our services is also driven by the industry capacity of hydraulic fracturing equipment. Historically, the industry has built additional equipment to supply the increased demand. When the demand declines, the industry has more equipment than what is needed by customers. This often leads to a decline in the price for our services until equipment is de-activated and the supply and demand fundamentals are closer to balanced.
For these reasons, our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations.
Seasonality
Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations. However, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers’ capital expenditure budgets are depleted. Similarly, the beginning of some years has a slow start as customers are starting a new capital budget cycle and our operations are more prone to experience winter weather. Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions that cause disruption to our supply chain or our ability to transport materials and equipment to the job site.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 890 total employees, primarily all were full-time. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Insurance
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims.
Despite our high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, and our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for our industry. These coverages and retentions address certain risks relating to commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business auto, property and equipment, directors and officers, environment, pollution and other risks. Although we maintain insurance coverage in types and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium or deductible costs relative to perceived risk.
Safety and Health Regulation
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information about 

6



the identities and hazards of the chemicals used or produced in operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, labeling requirements, training requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard, which requires hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls to limit exposure to respirable silica sand by June 23, 2021. Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of this rule or any other proposed rule, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our research and development efforts are focused on providing specific solutions to the challenges our customers face when fracturing and stimulating wells. In addition to the design and manufacture of innovative equipment, we have also developed proprietary blends of chemicals that we use in connection with our hydraulic fracturing services. We have three U.S. patents relating to fracturing methods, the technology used in fluid-ends, hydraulic pumps and other equipment. We believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are also valuable proprietary assets. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications for various names under which our entities do or intend to conduct business and offer products. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business.
Governmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, natural resources, clean air, drinking water, wetlands and endangered species, as well as chemical use and storage, waste management, and transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may impose strict liability, joint and several liability or both for environmental contamination. Strict liability means we could be liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements, including as a result of the recent presidential and congressional elections, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities. Environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, including its potential impacts on drinking water sources, have become the subject of increasing scrutiny by governmental authorities. This scrutiny, including ongoing or proposed studies of hydraulic fracturing like these could spur initiatives to further regulate the practice under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) or other regulatory mechanisms. For example, on November 29, 2018, EPA and the State Review of Oil and Natural Gas Environmental Regulation (“STRONGER”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding pursuant to which EPA and STRONGER will collaborate on oil and natural gas exploration and development regulatory programs.
In addition, public concerns have been raised recently regarding the disposal of hydraulic fluid in injection wells. Partly in response to public concerns, the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”), amended its existing oil and gas disposal well regulations to require seismic activity data in permit applications and provisions to authorize the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. Regulations in the states in which we operate may require our customers to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate saltwater disposal wells. These regulatory agencies have the general authority to suspend or modify one or more of these permits if continued operation of an underground injection well is likely to result in pollution of freshwater, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, leaks to the environment or other conditions such as earthquakes. Although we are not involved in the injection process of wells that 

7



we provide services on for our customers, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries.
Further, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the RRC issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The well integrity rule took effect in January 2014. Other states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as regional authorities such as the Delaware River Basin Commission and local governments, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, while certain other states have issued bans on the practice. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. See “Risk Factors—Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays” in Item 1A of this annual report
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund law,” and comparable state laws generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the conduct at the time it occurred, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time a release of hazardous substances occurred and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances to an offsite facility, and liability under these laws can be imposed on a joint and several basis without regard to fault and can extend to damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations issued thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water, which require covered facilities to obtain permits, maintain storm water plans and implement practices to minimize risks related to storm water. In June 2016, EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
These laws and regulations also prohibit certain other activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the “Corps.” In September 2015, a new rule became effective which was issued by the EPA and the Corps defining the scope of the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Corps over wetlands and other waters of the United States. After extensive litigation and rulemaking, on January 23, 2020, the EPA and Corps replaced this rule with the Navigable Waters Protection Rule to define “Waters of the United States,” a rule that streamlines the definition of “Water of the United States” that are federally regulated under the Clean Water Act to four categories. Litigation challenging the rule is ongoing, which may also be subject to revision by the current Presidential administration. The rapidly changing landscape of federal regulation creates uncertainty in our and our customers’ business. Under the Clean Water Act, we are also subject to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plan requirements that require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.

8



Underground injection operations are also subject to SDWA as well as analogous state and local laws and regulations including the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the UIC provisions to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of “underground injection” under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. Legislation regulating underground injection has been introduced at the state level. For example, at the state level, several states in which we operate, including Wyoming, Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma, have adopted regulations requiring operators to disclose certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids.
Waste Handling. Wastes from certain of our operations (such as equipment maintenance and past chemical development, blending, and distribution operations) are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain oil production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions.
However, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous.” Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own, owned previously or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws. Under such laws and related regulations, we have been and may be required to investigate, remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, but of which we have not been made aware, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants, including through the issuance of permits. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We are required to obtain air permits in connection with some activities under applicable laws. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for compliance. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit operations.
Additionally, the EPA’s Tier IV regulations apply to certain off-road diesel engines used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these regulations, we are required to retrofit or retire certain engines and we are limited in the number of non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Tier IV engines are costlier, and until Tier IV-compliant engines that meet our needs are more widely available, these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of diesel engines to expand our fleet and to replace existing engines as they are taken out of service.
Other Environmental Considerations. E&P activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, also known as NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. E&P activities, as well as proposed exploration and 

9



development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to habitat, jurisdictional waters or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration activities. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Government entities may require permits and may also seek damages for harm to species, habitat, or natural resources or resulting from filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials.
In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) enacted a new rule imposing a variety of regulatory mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal land, which was rescinded by the U.S. Department of the Interior in December 2017. In 2016, BLM promulgated regulations aimed at curbing air pollution, including greenhouse gases, for oil and natural gas produced on federal and Indian lands, but a number of waste prevention requirements were rescinded in 2018. On July 15, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated the U.S. Department of the Interior’s rescission of the 2015 rule. The outcome of ongoing litigation relating to the BLM rules, as well as any efforts to reissue them, or impose other limitations on oil and gas operations on federal lands, including any such efforts by the presidential administration, cannot be predicted. In addition, the new Presidential administration has taken steps to restrict oil and gas exploration on federal lands. On January 20, 2021, the Department of the Interior placed a 60-day moratorium on new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands. President Biden issued executive order on January 27, 2021, which, among other things, halts indefinitely new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a review by the Secretary of the Interior of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices in light of the administration's concerns regarding the impact of these activities on the environment and climate. These restrictions and similar restrictions that may be issued in the future may limit our operations and adversely impact our future financial results.
Climate Change. Responding to scientific studies that emissions of gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” including gases associated with the oil and gas sector such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide among others, may be contributing to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has begun to adopt regulations to report and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Any such regulations could affect our business, customers or the energy sector generally. In addition, the U.S. signed an international accord in December 2015, the so-called Paris Agreement, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas exploration and production operation as well as the power sector. However, in November 2019, the U.S. submitted a formal notice of its withdrawal to the United Nations. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued a statement formally accepting the Paris Agreement on behalf of the U.S., which triggers a 30 day process for rejoining the accord.
In 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations in 2016 that would set volatile organic compound (“VOC”) and methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. Those standards regulate GHGs through limitations on emissions of methane. However, in September 2020, the EPA published a final rule amending the 2016 regulations by removing sources in the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinding the new source performance standards (including VOC and methane requirements) applicable to these sources, and separately rescinding the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the industry. These final rules have become subject legal challenges and the outcome of these challenges is uncertain. In addition, these standards may be subject to reconsideration pursuant to an executive order issued by President Biden on January 20, 2021, which specifically calls for a proposal to suspend, revise or rescind the September 2020 final rule making technical amendments to the 2016 Standards by September 2021. The executive order also calls on EPA to consider new regulations governing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing onshore oil and gas operations by September 2021.

Notwithstanding these federal standards, state regulations with respect to emissions of GHGs could continue to become more restrictive regardless of the decreased burdens under federal regulations. For example, in June 2018 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PDEP”) adopted heightened permitting conditions for all newly permitted or modified natural gas compressor stations, processing plants and transmission stations constructed, modified, or operated in Pennsylvania in an effort to regulate emissions of the GHG methane at such sites. Then, in December 2019, the PDEP proposed a plan to regulate emissions of VOCs (including methane) at existing well sites and compressor stations. If these or any other actions to address GHG emissions become implemented in the future, they could result in increased costs associated with our operations, a decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities of our customers and affect the demand for natural gas.
In addition, the U.S. Congress occasionally attempts to adopt legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and many states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories, carbon pricing policies or regional cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not yet adopted such legislation, it may do so in the future. Several states continue to pursue related regulations as well. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our customers’ business and consequently our own.
In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal or state common law. Private parties, as well as local governments, have also filed lawsuits against certain energy companies seeking compensation for climate change related damages, including personal injury or property damages. Future climate change litigation could increase our operating costs or negatively impact demand for our services.
NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM.
Pollution Risk Management. We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through employee training. We also maintain a pollution risk management program if a pollution event occurs. This program includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical or hazardous substance release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical or hazardous substance release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to foreseeable environmental exposures. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address incidents that result in bodily injury or property damage and any ensuing investigation and clean up needed at our owned and leased facilities as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleet, as well as any claims resulting from our operations.
We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and risks relating to “downhole” liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water. The customers remove the water from the well using a controlled flow-back process, and we are not involved in that process or the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the greatest extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the

indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act.
