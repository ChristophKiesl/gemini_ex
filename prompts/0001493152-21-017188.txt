ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a marine power equipment, data solutions and service provider. We control the design, manufacture, sales, installation, operations and maintenance of our solutions and services while working closely with commercial, technical, and other development partners that provide software, controls, mechatronics, sensors, integration services, and marine installation services. We believe our renewable autonomous ocean solutions deliver power and data collection, analysis and communication in remote ocean environments, allowing users to gather actionable intelligence with their ocean jurisdictions. Our mission and purpose are to provide intelligent maritime solutions and services that enable safer and more productive ocean operations for the defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind markets. We achieve this through our proprietary, state-of-the-art technologies that are at the core of our clean and renewable energy platforms upon which we offer our solutions and services.
 
We continue to develop and commercialize our proprietary systems that generate electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves for our PowerBuoy® (“PB3”), and solar power for our hybrid PowerBuoy® (the “hybrid”). The PB3 uses proprietary technologies that convert the kinetic energy created by the heaving motion of ocean waves into electricity. Our strategy includes developing complete solutions and services, including cloud-based delivery systems for ocean data and predictive analytics to provide actionable intelligence for our clients. Based on feedback from our current customers, discussions with potential customers in the defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind markets, as well as government applications in fishery protection and protected marine areas, together with our market research and publicly available data, we believe that numerous markets have a direct need for our solutions. Our recent projects have been in the offshore oil and gas and science and research industries. We believe there is an increasing need for our products and services in areas such as fishery protection, offshore windfarm support, and maritime domain awareness applications. We believe that having demonstrated the capability of our solutions, we can advance our product and services and gain further adoption from our target markets. Our marketing efforts are focused on offshore locations that require a cost-efficient solution for renewable, reliable, and persistent power and communications, either by supplying electric power to payloads that are integrated directly with our product or located in its vicinity, such as on the seabed and in the water column. We believe we are the leader in offshore autonomous ocean wave power conversion technology which provides renewable power for offshore operations that were previously logistically problematic and difficult to decarbonize.
 
We are continuing to build upon our mission of connecting the oceans with those who operate and manager the resource in the environment. We do this through our solution offerings, that are based on our proprietary renewable power platforms and engineering skills. Our solutions focus on three major services areas, Data as a Service, supported and enabled by Power as a Service, and underpinned by our Strategic Consulting Services, which we expanded with the acquisition of 3dent Technology, LLC (“3Dent”), in February 2021. Over the course of fiscal 2022, we intend to continue to grow our service sectors and develop, evolve, and strengthen our solutions.
 
Our Power as a Service segment delivers value to customers by utilizing our managed power platforms, such as the PB3 PowerBuoy® or hybrid PowerBuoy®, and subsea battery for topside and subsea power applications. Our focus for this segment is on bringing autonomous clean power to our customers wherever it is required. On our project with Eni S.p.A. (“Eni”), we utilized our PB3 PowerBuoy®, which operated in the Adriatic Sea for over 600 days of continuous operation as part of Eni’s resident autonomous underwater vehicle (“AUV”) feasibility studies. During commercial operations, an AUV would remain on site to perform various inspection, maintenance, and repair tasks. As demonstrated during our project with Eni, our Power solutions generated sufficient power that could, with client assets extend missions for longer durations.
 
Our Data as a Service segment is an evolution of the work we did for Premium Oil (now known as Harbour Energy) in the North Sea in 2019. Since then, we have been developing a Maritime Domain Awareness solution (“MDA-S” or “MDA”) to introduce edge computing and artificial intelligence modules that can be delivered to customers via cyber secure cloud environments.
 
Our Strategic Consulting Services, materially strengthened by the acquired 3Dent team, focus on delivering value to our customers in the areas of ocean engineering, structural and dynamic analysis, Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) studies, and motion simulation. These services can be delivered as part of our broader Power and/or Data as a Service utilizing our solutions or on a standalone basis. In the near term, we are focusing on increasing our market share in the floating offshore wind market and the broader floating foundation design market, as well as our business with offshore oil and gas customers.

Throughout FY21 we delivered several transactions and projects laying the foundations for our growth in FY22. In February 2021, the Company acquired all the outstanding equity interest of 3Dent, a company based in Houston, Texas, that offers offshore engineering and design services that are complementary to our technology and products and strengthen our Strategic Consulting Services.
 
In November 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Offshore Operators Committee (“OOC”) under which the Company will provide engineering and technical services for a new project under the DeepStar Global Technology Consortium Program. This forms part of our Power as a Service offering.
 
In October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Adams Communication & Engineering Technology, Inc. (“ACET”) to conduct a feasibility study for the evaluation of a PB3 power and 5G communications solution in support of the U.S. Navy’s Naval Postgraduate School’s Sea, Land, Air, Military Research Initiative (“SLAMR”). This forms part of our Data as a Service division. 
 
We also strengthened our balance sheet by raising over $81.0 million of cash through At the Market (“ATM”) and equity line of credit (“ELOC”) programs with Alliance Group Partners (“AGP”) and Aspire Capital (“Aspire”).
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in April 1984 and began commercial operations in 1994. On April 23, 2007, we reincorporated in Delaware.
 
Our Solutions and Power Generating Platform Services
 
PB3 PowerBuoy®
 
The PB3 generates electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves. The PB3 features a unique onboard power take-off (“PTO”) system, which incorporates both energy storage and energy management and control systems. The PB3 generates a nominal name-plated capacity rating of up to 3 kilowatts (“kW”)of peak power during recharging of the onboard batteries. Power generation is deployment-site dependent. Our standard energy storage system (“ESS”) has an energy capacity of up to a nominal 150 kW-hours to meet specific application requirements.
 
The PB3 is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in remote offshore locations. The hull consists of a main spar structure loosely moored to the seabed and surrounded by a floating annular structure that can freely move up and down in response to the passage of the waves. The PTO system includes a mechanical actuating system, an electrical generator, a power electronics system, our control system, and our ESS which is sealed within the hull. As ocean waves pass the PB3, the mechanical stroke action created by the rising and falling of the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the PTO, which in turn, drives the electric generator. The power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is collected within an ESS. The operation of the PB3 is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system.
 
The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the PB3 subsystems. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the PB3 is a significant advantage of our technology. In the event of large storm waves, the control system automatically locks the PB3, and electricity generation is suspended. However, the load center (either the on-board payload or one in the vicinity of the PB3) may continue to receive power from the ESS. When wave heights return to normal operating conditions, the control system automatically unlocks the PB3 and electricity generation and ESS replenishment recommences. This safety feature helps to prevent the PB3 from being damaged by storms.
 
The PB3 can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods. Once at port, the PB3 can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity. The PB3 may then be towed to site using a standard vessel (if the location is within an appropriate distance from the port), or the PB3 may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site. The PB3 is then attached to the mooring system, which is installed during a separate operation, after which a brief commissioning process places the PB3 into operation.
 
We believe that using wave energy for electricity generation has the following potential benefits, compared to existing incumbent solutions.
 

● | Scalability within a small site area. Due to the dense energy in ocean waves, we believe that the electricity may be aggregated to supply larger payloads, as a result, for example, of multiple PB3 which are placed in an array, occupying a relatively small area. We believe the array of a larger number of PB3 could offer end users a variety of advantages in availability, reliability and scalability. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Predictability. The generation of power from wave energy can be forecasted several days in advance. Available wave energy can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy based on satellite images and meteorological data, even when the wave field is hundreds of miles away and days from reaching a PB3. Therefore, we believe end-users relying on PB3 for power may be able to proactively plan their logistics, payload scheduling and other operational activities based on such data, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Constant source of energy. The annual occurrence of waves at specific sites can be relatively persistent and defined with relatively high accuracy. Based on our studies and analyses of various sites of interest, we believe that we will be able to deploy our PB3 in locations where the waves could produce usable electricity for most of the year. 

 
Based on our market research and publicly available data, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) 2019 Powering the Blue Economy Report, the Westwood Energy World ROV Operations Forecast 2019-2023, and the World Bank Database, we believe that numerous markets may have a direct need for our PB3 including defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind, as well as government applications in fishery protection and marine protected areas. Depending on payload power requirements, sensor types and other considerations, we have found that our PB3 could satisfy several application requirements within these markets. We believe that the PB3 can generates sufficient power to meet the requirements of many potential customer applications within our target markets, and that the hybrid could provide ample power in geographies where wave conditions may not be sufficient to allow the PB3 to generate sufficient power.
 
hybrid PowerBuoy® 
 
The Company has product launched a hybrid PowerBuoy® that is a solar powered surface buoy, compared to the wave power generating PB3. The hybrid PowerBuoy® is powered primarily through solar panels with an efficient and clean burning external combustion Stirling engine to provide back-up power and is capable of providing reliable power in remote offshore locations, regardless of ocean wave conditions. We believe this product is complementary to the PB3 by providing the Company the opportunity to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave environments, with the potential for greater product integration within each customer project. It is primarily intended for shorter term deployment applications, such as electric remotely operated vehicle (“eROV”) and autonomous underwater vehicle (“AUV”) inspections and short-term maintenance, topside surveillance and communications, and subsea equipment and controls. The hybrid can be quickly deployed and offers customers a cost-effective solution. The design has a high payload capacity for communications and surveillance, with the capability of being tethered to subsea payloads such as batteries, or with a conventional anchor mooring system. The hybrid generates power from both an array of solar panels and an efficient, clean burning 1 kW Stirling engine fueled by liquid propane. This energy is stored in onboard batteries which power subsea and topside payloads. The Company has designed the hybrid with a Stirling engine backup system to outperform traditional diesel buoys, which we believe have more frequent service and refueling intervals and higher carbon intensities. We believe the hybrid will be able to operate over a broad range of temperature and ocean wave conditions.
 
The towable, boat-shaped hull design of the hybrid is appropriate for deployment throughout the world. Power is generated independent of wave activity, making it a good solution for providing power through extreme weather and in heaving seas, or in calm, low wave environments and is complimentary to the PB3.
 
As with the PB3, the control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the hybrid subsystems. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the hybrid is a significant advantage of our technology. In the event of extended cloudy periods, the control system automatically switches electricity generation from the solar panels to the backup engine. However, the load center, either the on-board payload or one in the vicinity of the hybrid, may continue to receive power from the on-board ESS. When more suitable solar power generation conditions return, the control system automatically stops the backup up engine and ESS replenishment recommences by way of solar electricity generation.
 
The hybrid is designed for use with a single point umbilical and mooring but can be adapted for a 3-point mooring installation for use as a temporary replacement for PB3 installations during planned maintenance or repairs.
 
The hybrid can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods. Once at port, the hybrid can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity. The hybrid may then be towed to site using a standard vessel (if the location is within an appropriate distance from the port), or the hybrid may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site. The hybrid is then attached to the single point mooring system, which is installed during a separate operation, after which a brief commissioning process places the hybrid into operation.
 
The hybrid is configured with a nominal 30 kW-hours of battery energy storage and approximately 1 megawatt-hour (“MWh”) of stored energy in the propane system. While the batteries are primarily charged through solar power generation, the propane powered Stirling engine system on the hybrid can be considered reserve energy storage, with propane having a much higher energy storage density than lithium-ion batteries. It can be utilized when needed based on load demand and will provide approximately 1 MWh of stored energy capacity. We believe that this amount of stored energy offers an attractive local, autonomous energy solution for clients in a range of industries, including but not limited to offshore oil and gas and marine observation, particularly for shorter term deployments.

Subsea Battery
 
We have product launched a subsea battery that is complementary to both of our PB3 and hybrid products and can be deployed together with our PowerBuoys® or on its own. It offers customers the option of placing additional modular and expandable energy storage on the seabed near existing or to be installed subsea equipment. Our lithium-ion subsea batteries supply power that can enable subsea equipment, sensors, communications and AUV and eROV recharge. Our PB3 and hybrid are complimentary to the subsea batteries by providing a means for recharging during longer term deployments, or the batteries can be used independently for shorter term deployments.
 
The subsea battery has been designed to provide continuous and/or short-term power supply from its integrated energy storage system, enabling us to supply into a range of industries and applications, from backup power to critical subsea infrastructure to continuous operation of subsea equipment, such as electric valves. The base design of the subsea battery has a nominal 100 kW-hours of energy storage. The subsea battery can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods. Once at port, the subsea battery can be lifted onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity. The battery can then be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site. It comes installed on a ready deployable subsea skid suitable for installation on the seabed. The subsea battery can be integrated into other subsea equipment on land prior to deployment. The battery is then connected to the other components on the seabed with the use of an eROV.
 
Maritime Domain Awareness Solution
 
The International Maritime Organization defines Maritime Domain Awareness as the effective understanding of any activity that could impact upon the security, safety, economy, or environment. Since 2002 the United States of America, for example, has had an active strategy to secure the Maritime Domain. Furthermore, in 2020 US Coast Guard elevated Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (“IUU”) fisheries, one aspect of MDA security, as the leading global maritime threat. It is estimated that tens of billions of Dollars are lost every year to IUU fishing alone.
 
We intend our MDA Solution payload to consist of a high-definition radar, gyro-stabilized high-definition optical and thermal imaging cameras, vessel automatic identification system (“AIS”) detection, and integrated command and control software and as customer needs dictate. Capabilities include 24/7 vessel tracking, automatic radar plotting, automated vessel warnings, and high-definition optical and thermal video surveillance capable of providing evidentiary backup of activity to aid in prosecution.
 
We intend data from our MDA solution will be processed onboard our buoys using edge computing, developed together with our software partners, transmitted to shore-based command stations via cyber-secure Wi-Fi, cellular, and/or satellite systems, depending upon location, and then further processed in our cloud-based analytics platform. Surveillance data can be integrated with readily available marine monitoring software or with our own MDA software solution developed together with leading partners in the technology industry to provide command and control features of a multi-buoy surveillance network. The data can also be integrated with satellite, weather, bathymetric, and other data feeds to form a detailed surface and subsea picture of a monitored area.
 
A single buoy Maritime Domain Awareness Solution, coupled with a PB3 PowerBuoy®, can monitor vessel traffic, with or without AIS turned on, across an area approximately 1,300 square nautical miles of ocean territory on a permanent or temporary basis, with the ability to link multiple surveillance assets together over large ocean areas giving end-users visibility into potentially damaging environmental or illegal activities. Customized solutions are also available including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures, tsunami, and water quality.
 
Strategic Consulting Services 
 
In addition to work being performed by OPT for the DeepStar project, through our technology subsidiary, 3Dent, we also offer a full range of high-level offshore engineering, including providing consulting engineering and design services to offshore wind developers, offshore construction companies, drilling contractors, major oil companies, service companies, shipyards, and engineering firms. 3Dent’s team of dedicated consultants/designers has expertise in structural engineering, hydrodynamics and naval architecture. Among its services is a focus on addressing the issues current or would-be owners of offshore floaters, jackups, and lift boats have with their fleet. 3Dent’sservices include simulation engineering, software engineering, concept design and motion analysis.

Competitive Advantages
 
We intend to commercializing our products and solutions by targeting customers in our principal markets (defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind, as well as government applications in fishery protection and marine protected areas) that require reliable and persistent power sources in remote offshore locations for short and long-term deployments. We believe that our solutions and our existing commercial relationships provide the following competitive advantages in our target markets:

● | Numerous applications within multiple major market segments. We have designed our products to address multiple offshore applications around the world. We are targeting customers with multiple applications within the defense and security, offshore oil and gas, science and research, and offshore wind markets as well as government applications in fishery protection and marine protected areas (“MPAs”). Our PB3 is designed for longer-term deployment in high ocean wave climates. Our hybrid is designed to meet the needs of customers with projects in low sea state locations and/or those requiring short-term deployments. We believe our subsea battery enables persistent power to be delivered from the seabed to support autonomous, all-electric subsea operations. Together, all these products can be integrated to provide customized power solutions for our customers. Our PowerBuoy® products can also act as self-powered solution platforms for payloads, such as our MDA package which can provide real-time perimeter security, vessel tracking and area surveillance for government defense and fishery protection. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Considerable life-cycle cost savings over current solutions for many applications. Our PB3 is designed to operate over extended intervals between required servicing. We believe that our PB3 reduces costs over multi-year operations. These cost reductions are mostly due to reduced vessel and personnel servicing activities. For short term deployments, our hybrid is a cost-efficient means of providing MDA and subsea power solutions. Our subsea battery can provide power to sea floor systems when combined with either the PB3 or hybrid for power regeneration, thus reducing or even potentially eliminating the need for manned vessels to replace expended subsea batteries during mission life. 
● | Real-time data communications. Our PowerBuoys® can be equipped with a variety of communications equipment, such as 5G, 4G LTE, satellite (VSAT) and Wi-Fi, which enables the transmission of data on a frequent or near-continuous basis. We believe that more frequent data communication could enable an end-user to more quickly and proactively make data-driven decisions which could result in economic advantages. Real-time data communications are an essential component of our MDA payload, allowing continued autonomous remote monitoring of marine traffic from land. 
● | Increased power and persistence compared to certain current solutions. We have found that our PowerBuoys® may provide substantial power and persistence for long term deployments. We believe that this may allow additional sensors to be employed at the same site, a higher sensor data transmission rate to be achieved, extended operation and reduced downtime, and improved operational costs for the customer. Enabling these new capabilities may contribute to enhanced operations through real-time decision making and increased life-cycle cost savings. 
● | Modular and scalable designs. Our PB3 and hybrid are designed with a modular ESS which allows us to tailor its configuration to specific application requirements, including expansion of energy storage capacity, potentially allowing for a more customized solution and potential cost savings for our customers. We believe that our power technology is scalable to higher power levels We have developed concepts for multiple PB3s to be installed in an array in order to achieve higher levels of aggregate power in remote areas where other power sources become cost prohibitive, although to date we have not yet demonstrated a PB3 array. We believe that the modular design of our subsea battery enables clients to specify larger energy storage than would be possible with just buoys and have this placed at the seabed and near existing electric subsea equipment. 


● | Flexible electrical, mechanical and communication interfaces for sensors. The PB3 and hybrid can be equipped with payloads, either mounted on or within the PowerBuoy®, or tethered to the PowerBuoy®. The PowerBuoys® have mechanical and electrical interfaces which allow for simplified integration of payloads, creating flexibility for the end-user. Our subsea battery will have specific interfaces for simplified integration with our PowerBuoys® for electric power recharging, as well as for surface communications. Our PowerBuoys® will also have standard interfaces for subsea batteries of other providers for charging as well as multiple payloads. Flexible interfaces reduce cost through simplified integration and deployment.

● | Zero carbon emission, environmentally benign and aesthetically non-intrusive system design. Our PB3 emits no carbon. We further believe that our PB3 does not present significant risks to marine life, nor does it emit significant levels of pollutants, and therefore has minimal environmental impact. We believe there is no significant audible impact to the surrounding environment. We believe that our PB3 produces renewable electricity through the conversion of renewable ocean wave energy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Ocean and factory-tested technology. Our PB3 is designed to be durable, with a three-year interval between required maintenance activities. The PB3 has survived hurricanes, tropical storms and North Sea winter storms. The PB3 has been successfully deployed for Harbour Energy, Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd (“MES”) and Eni. The MES PB3 performed well in a challenging shallow-water, high-current environment, and achieved its performance and duration objectives. The Eni PB3 was deployed in the Adriatic Sea for twenty-four months and has generated approximately 3.0 megawatt hours of energy. Further, we continue to focus on standardizing manufacturing and production testing procedures and have work closely with our supply base to ensure production repeatability. 
● | Efficient design in harnessing renewable energy. We have designed and validated our PB3 for maximized power generation in average ocean wave conditions through optimized mechanical to electrical wave energy conversion. We have designed the onboard ESS to provide several days of continuous rated power during periods of low or no wave activity, depending on payload power consumption. For locations with consistent periods of low or no wave activity, or for locations with short-term power requirements, our hybrid can generate power using solar panels and a liquid-fuel backup power generation system. 
● | Prior commercial relationships enabled the development of our technology. Our prior and existing relationships with the U.S. Navy, DOE, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, MES, Eni, Enel Green Power (“EGP”), and Harbour Energy have allowed us to further develop our solutions for a variety of needs in various industries. We believe these relationships have helped position us within the private sector for future commercial opportunities, which we believe enhances our market visibility and attractiveness to our prospective customers. We believe that our deployments with MES, Eni and Harbour Energy have provided commercial market credibility and allowed us to develop and market end-user solutions which we believe are valued in our principal markets. 

Market Opportunities
 
The Company takes a rigorous approach to market evaluation. Utilizing publicly available and purchased data, we evaluate total addressable market sizes. We apply screening criteria to narrow our focus within these markets and identify sub-segments and associated service addressable market sizes. These market evaluations are updated on an ongoing basis throughout the year and more formally twice annually in line with our financial calendar. In 2019 the DOE’s Water Power Technology Office (WPTO) released the report Powering the Blue Economy: Exploring Opportunities for Marine Renewable Energy in Maritime Markets. The report described eight non-grid applications where renewable marine energy could provide consistent, reliable power. The identified marine energy applications are ocean observation, underwater vehicle charging, marine aquaculture, marine algae, seawater mining, seawater desalination, coastal resiliency and disaster recovery, and isolated communities. We have been focused on addressing the energy needs of many of these applications (e.g., ocean observation, underwater vehicle charging), and other offshore applications (e.g., maritime domain awareness, well-head monitoring and subsea equipment control).
Offshore Oil and Gas
 
We believe the offshore oil and gas industry is undergoing a significant transformation as it continues to invest in new technologies that enable carbon reduction, cost savings and the electrification and digitization of operations. The industry encompasses more than 10,000 offshore sites, including exploration, production, reservoir management, and sites pending decommissioning based on information from organizations such as the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) and industry organizations and publications. We believe that we have opportunities to implement one or more PB3s at some of these sites to provide power in applications that are not currently possible, displace current power solutions, or augment existing technologies. This is partially driven by the growing demand for electrification. For example, according to a 2019 Rystads report, Norway is estimated to have 40% of its oil and gas production from electrified fields, as well as a growing desire for decarbonization and autonomous operations. Similarly, the market for remote and autonomous charging of subsea assets, such as ROVs and AUVs, is rapidly taking shape. Based on various reports, other applications in the oil and gas market include providing power to unmanned platforms and area surveillance during decommissioning activities. Although estimates vary in these reports, they generally point towards more than 4,000 platforms (and corresponding wells) that need to be decommissioned over the next 10 years across the globe. We see this market materializing primarily in the North Sea and regions such as Brazil and Australia. Furthermore, there is an increasing market demand for providing interim power solutions for tie-backs where umbilicals are exhibiting failures.

Defense and Security
 
We believe that our PB3 is uniquely positioned to be used to provide power and communications for multiple applications within the defense and security markets. The PB3’s ability to power multiple payloads may be an attractive feature for these markets, as their systems can be easily integrated into other PowerBuoy® applications allowing their operation to be concealed. An example application for domestic and international defense departments and defense contractors includes forward deployed energy and communications outposts (which is a current U.S. Department of Defense program), both above and below sea surface, as indicated in the completed study for the Naval Postgraduate School. Other example of applications includes perimeter security, early detection and warning systems, remote sensing stations, high frequency radar, sonar, electro-optical and infrared sensors for maritime security, network communications systems, and unmanned underwater vehicle docking stations.
 
IUU fishing has become a global issue with both environmental and economic consequences. According to a report published in Sciences Advances by The University of British Columbia in February 2020, it is estimated the global economic impact from illegal fishing to be as high as $50 billion. Most exclusive economic zone monitoring is done by offshore patrol vessels (“OPV”), which is one of the fastest growing naval product markets with around 1,242 OPVs in service currently. We believe that our autonomous surveillance solution, which can be combined with satellite imagery, can deliver substantial economic impact to governments over incumbent solutions in securing remote fisheries and MPAs. In the USA specifically, IUU fishing is considered a major maritime threat by the Department of Homeland Security.
 
Science and Research
 
The science and research market provides environmental intelligence to the entire ocean enterprise, which supports ocean measurement, observation and forecasting, and is an important provider of information to maritime commerce and the entire “blue economy.” Maritime commerce and the scientific community depend on information in areas such as meteorology, climate change, ocean currents, and biological processes to inform operations and development. These groups often require a power and communications solution in remote offshore locations. Additionally, the increased interest in protecting marine habitats offers opportunities to collaborate with governments and NGOs to monitor marine sanctuaries. The European Union’s Copernicus Program is estimated to have enabled € 190 million in revenues during 2018 for ocean monitoring alone and this is expected to reach € 206 million in 2020 with an average growth rate of 4% annually.
Offshore Wind and Other Markets 
 
We believe that opportunities also exist in other markets such as supporting offshore windfarm development and aquaculture. Based on an article in Wind Power Monthly in October 2019, the offshore wind fleet is forecast to grow 15-fold by 2040 and move further offshore with Europe alone connecting over 500 turbines in 2019. Whilst these turbines develop significant power, there are opportunities pre-installation of the turbines; to autonomously collect ocean data during the early stages and monitoring of marine habitats during construction. To mitigate carbon emissions there are also opportunities to support ongoing survey work once windfarms are operational and to provide communication stations for aerial drones providing maintenance materials. Furthermore, the United States of America recently approved the permits for the first major utility scale offshore windfarm. Providing wave power solutions to utility scale renewable developments offers an attractive proposition to support renewable power and autonomous operations. We believe that our solutions can support aquaculture development with systems such as species escape tracking, effluent monitoring, and other water quality considerations.
Business Strategy
 
During fiscal 2021, we advanced our marketing programs, products, and solutions. We have made progress in transitioning from R&D to commercialization and we intend to build on these efforts by implementing processes and solutions that cover the entire life cycle, from demand generation to close of contract, and from channel strategies to customer care.
 
Most of the Company’s opportunities with potential customers have been for projects in Western Europe, including the North Sea, as well as North America and Asia. Nearly two-thirds of these opportunities have progressed past initial feasibility and non-disclosure agreement stages to more detailed, confidential discussions around specific customer applications.

Many proposal requests are for projects where one of our PowerBuoy® products, either the PB3, the hybrid, or our subsea battery is part of a larger solution deployment, and typically include the potential lease or sale of one or more PowerBuoys®, as well as required services and maintenance support. A majority of hybrid inquiries are for shorter term deployments in calmer waters. Historically, demonstration projects have been a necessary step toward broad solution deployment and revenues associated with specific applications. A proposal phase typically lasts from three months to more than one year. During the demonstration project specification, negotiation and evaluation period, we are often subject to the prospective customer’s vendor qualification process, which entails substantial due diligence of our company and capabilities and may include negotiation of standard terms and conditions. Many proposals contain provisions which would mandate the sale or lease of our PowerBuoy® product upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project.
 
We believe this is an accurate depiction of the overall sales cycle for new technology in each of our target markets, including our products and solutions. Cycle times for each step of the sales cycle will vary depending on several customer factors, including, but not limited to, technical evaluation, project priorities, project funding approval process, and alignment of new technology integration with the customer’s broader operational strategy. We believe that the resulting evidence of potential demand, vis-à-vis specific application proposal requests, is indicative of progress in our commercialization strategy. We believe that we have the potential for growth as a result of our positioning for higher volume production of our PowerBuoy® products and the initial indications of demand for our PowerBuoy® products in multiple customer applications.
 
The Company is pursuing a long-term growth strategy to expand its market value proposition while building the Company’s revenue base. This strategy includes partnerships with leading companies in adjacent and complementary markets. We continue to commercialize our PowerBuoy® products for use in remote offshore power and real-time data communications applications, and in order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives:
 

● | Integrated turn-key solutions sales or leases incorporating our products and services. We believe our PB3 hybrid and our subsea battery solutions, as well as our MDA Solutions, are well suited to enable many uncrewed, autonomous (non-grid connected) offshore solutions, such as topside and subsea surveillance and communications, subsea equipment monitoring, early warning systems platform and subsea power and buffering, and weather and climate data collection. We have investigated and realized market demand for some of these solutions and we intend to sell and lease our products to these markets as part of these broader integrated solutions. Additionally, we intend to provide services associated with our solution offerings such as paid engineering studies, value-added engineering, maintenance, remote monitoring and diagnostic, application engineering, planning, training, project management, and marine and logistics support required for our solution life cycle. We continue to increase our commercial capabilities through new hires in sales and application support, and through engagement of expert market consultants in various geographies.

● | Expand customer system solution offerings through new complimentary products that enable shorter and more cost-efficient deployments. The hybrid is highly complementary to the PB3 by providing the Company the opportunity to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs, including low-wave environments, with the potential for greater system integration within each customer project. The hybrid is primarily intended for shorter term deployment applications such as eROV and AUV inspections and short-term maintenance, topside surveillance and communications, and subsea equipment and controls. The Company has developed a subsea battery system that is complimentary to the Company’s PowerBuoy® products. The subsea battery system offers the possibility of creating a sea floor energy storage solution for remote offshore operations. These subsea battery systems contain lithium-ion batteries, which provide high power density to supply power to subsea equipment, sensors, communications, and the recharging of AUVs and eROVs. Ideal for many remote offshore customer applications, these subsea battery systems are anticipated to be safe, high performance, cost-efficient, and quickly deployable. 
● | Concentrate sales and marketing efforts in specific geographic markets. We are currently focusing our marketing efforts globally. We believe that each of these areas has demand for our solutions, sizable end market opportunities, political and economic stability, and high levels of industrialization and economic development. In fiscal 2021, we opened an office in Houston, Texas to further support our customers and strengthen our dialogue with our solution partners.

● | Expand our relationships in key market areas through strategic partnerships and collaborations. We believe that strategic partners are an important part of commercializing new products. Partnerships and collaborations can be used to improve the development of overall integrated solutions, create new market channels, expand commercial know-how and geographic footprint, and bolster our product delivery capabilities. We have formed such a relationship with several well-known groups, and we continue to seek other opportunities to collaborate with application experts from within our selected markets. These partnerships have helped us source services, such as installation expertise, and products, such as MDA enabling equipment, to meet our development and customer obligations. Following our acquisition of 3Dent, we have been actively pursuing additional opportunities to bring in-house skills, capabilities, and solutions that are complementary to our strategy and enable us to scale more quickly.

● | Outsourcing of fabrication, deployment and service support. In order to minimize our capital requirement as we scale our business, we intend to outsource all fabrication, anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and in some cases deployment of our products and solutions. Our PTO is a proprietary subsystem that is assembled and tested at our facility. We believe this distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to focus on our core competencies and ensure a cost-effective product by leveraging a larger more established supply base. We continue to seek strategic partnerships with regard to servicing of our products and solutions. 


● | Cost reduction and PowerBuoy® solution development. Our engineering efforts are mainly focused on addressing customer solutions; product and solution sales; reducing production, installation, and product life-cycle costs; and improving the energy output, reliability, maintenance interval and expected operating life of our products. We continue to optimize manufacturability of our designs with a focus on cost competitiveness, and we believe we will be able to address new applications by developing new payloads and solutions that address customer needs.

Through its 3Dent Technology subsidiary, the Company plans to expand its customer base and increase its revenue base, by providing consulting engineering and design services to offshore wind developers, offshore construction companies, drilling contractors, major oil companies, service companies, and engineering firms.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We continue to enhance our marketing capabilities across our target markets, and we are actively marketing our products and solutions. We currently use a direct sales force consisting of employees and industry expert consultants. Because our solutions use technology which is not yet fully adopted by our target markets, we expect that the customer decision process could require us to spend substantial time educating end-users and stakeholders, which may result in a lengthy sales cycle.
 
In the past year, given the global pandemic COVID-19 restrictions, many conferences and trade shows were cancelled, rescheduled, or held virtually. OPT attended and presented at a number of these virtual conferences. Given the progress being made globally in reducing COVID through vaccines and other practices, we are starting to see in person conferences being scheduled for the second half of 2021. We have plans to attend and present at a few conferences and trade shows in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
 
We market our products and solutions to companies and entities requiring remote offshore power and data services, including for example, offshore oil and gas companies. We also see opportunities for defense and security applications such as maritime domain awareness solutions that require autonomous offshore power and data gateways.
 
Additionally, we seek to enter into strategic relationships to develop application solutions with commercial and military sensor and equipment manufacturers.
 
Competition
 
We expect to compete with other providers of in-ocean autonomous power sources, primarily consisting of subsea batteries, solar and fossil-fuel power sources, where many of the providers are substantially larger than OPT and may have access to greater financial resources. Incumbent sources of in-ocean power may also represent established and reliable power sources and may have already gained customer acceptance. Our ability to compete successfully for business from applications seeking in-ocean power will depend on (a) our ability to produce and store energy reliably and at a total cost that is competitive with or lower than that of other sources, and (b) the demonstrated reliability of our products and positive customer perception of our company. We also may have the opportunity to cooperate with other solution providers, such as other suppliers of subsea batteries where our PowerBuoys® could provide recharging capabilities or other providers of autonomous surface vessels where our PowerBuoys® could provide charging and enhanced communications capabilities.

As of April 2021, there were over 400 companies, some with institutional funding, listed in the OpenEi Marine Renewable Energy (“MRE”) Database. The MRE database is developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories with support from DOE and other partners. Many of these companies are located in the U.K., continental Europe, Japan, Israel, the U.S. and Australia, and many of those companies are pursuing the utility, grid-connected energy market. The MRE industry continues to evolve as participants strive to differentiate themselves by promoting their specific technology focusing on cost and efficiency. The companies are subdivided by implementation: wave power, current power, tidal and ocean thermal energy conversion. Within wave power, the technologies are classified as point absorber, oscillating wave column, overtopping device, attenuator and oscillating wave surge converter. Our PowerBuoy® wave energy converter is classified as a point absorber.
 
The vast majority of the companies in the DOE’s database are small, start-up type companies with a small number of employees and in early-stage development that do not have our in-ocean validation experience. Only a few of these companies have conducted testing similar to us, such as accelerated life testing and extensive wave tank testing on reduced scale models of their devices. We believe our in-ocean experience is critical towards proving the reliability, survivability and performance of any wave energy system, which we believe our future customers will require before adopting any wave generated energy solution. We believe our experience gained through full scale in-ocean deployments, coupled with other types of factory and laboratory testing, and our resulting understanding of risks and failure modes provides us with an advantage compared to potential wave energy competitors.
 
Based on market and industry observations, we believe there are only a small number of companies that are developing systems to compete in the offshore autonomous power market; however, their technologies are in earlier stage development with limited commercial deployments. Through our ongoing product development and building upon our years of commercial deployment data, we believe that we continue to maintain a first mover advantage in the smaller scale autonomous offshore power market.
 
We continuously monitor non-traditional competitive threats, such as multi domain drones and artificial intelligence tools utilizing satellite data. We are in active discussions with companies in these markets to evaluate synergistic solution development where we believe there may be a demand for cooperative solutions.
 
Commercial Activities
 
We continue to seek new strategic relationships and further develop our existing partnerships. We collaborate with companies that have developed or are developing in-ocean applications requiring a persistent source of power that is also capable of real time data collection, processing and communication, to address potential customer needs. The table below shows the percentage of the Company’s revenues derived from customers whose revenues accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for at least one of the periods indicated:

 | Twelve months ended April 30, | 
----------------------------+-------------------------------+----
Customer | 2021 | | | 2020
Eni S.p.A. | | 22 | % | | 10 | %
EGP | | 61 | % | | 72 | %
Other (no cutomer over 10%) | | 17 | % | | 18 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
In order to achieve success in commercializing our products, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts to lease or sell our solutions and services to customers. Our potential customer base for our solutions includes various public and private entities, and agencies that require remote offshore power. To date, substantially all of our revenue producing contracts have been with a small number of customers under contracts to fund a portion of the costs of our operational efforts to develop and improve our technology, validate our product through ocean and laboratory testing, and business development activities with potential commercial customers. Our goal in the future is that an increased portion of our revenues will be from the lease or sale of our products and related maintenance as well as consultative and other services.

Current and Recent Customers
 

● | In November 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the OOC under which the Company will provide engineering and technical services for a new project under the DeepStar Global Technology Consortium Program. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with ACET to conduct a feasibility study for the evaluation of a PB3 power and 5G communications solution in support of the U.S. Navy Naval Postgraduate School’s SLAMR. 
● | In March 2020, Eni exercised their option from the March 2018 contract to extend their lease of the PB3 for an additional 18 months. The initial provision in March 2018 agreement provided for a minimum 24-month contract that included an 18-month PB3 lease and associated project management. In November 2020, Eni retrieved the PB3 and returned it to shore due to a mooring issue. 
● | In September 2019, we entered two contracts with subsidiaries of EGP, which included the sale of a PB3 and the development and supply of a turn-key integrated Open Sea Lab (“OSL”) that was expected to be the Company’s first deployment off the coast of Chile. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, EGPdeclared force majeure in April 2020 and delayed the deployment. In March 2021, the Company began the deployment process and placed the PB3 in the water. Additional deployment activities are planned in the summer of 2021. 
● | In April 2019, we entered into an agreement with a leading oil and gas operator to conduct a detailed feasibility study of using the Company’s technology to monitor subsea wells. 
● | In February 2019, we entered a contract with the U.S. Navy to carry out the first phase of a project to design and develop a buoy mooring system, which incorporates fiber optics for the transmission of subsea sensor data to airplanes, ships, and satellites. 
● | In June 2018, we entered into a contract with Harbour Energy for the lease of a PB3 to be deployed in one of Harbour Energy’s offshore fields in the North Sea. During its deployment, the PB3 provided unmanned EZM service. In early March 2020 the Company and Harbour Energy retrieved the PB3. 

Partnerships
 
We believe that our solutions are best developed, sold, deployed, and maintained together with subject matter experts in their respective fields. This enables OPT to protect, maintain, and evolve our power platforms and integrate them with surface and subsea payloads. OPT has previously entered into partnerships focusing on including, but not limited to, deployment and installations, sourcing of surface payloads, and integration with autonomous vehicles. OPT is also entering into software and robotics partnerships to further develop the MDA solution offering.
 
Furthermore, we are in active discussions with larger systems integrators to develop partnerships focusing on selling our platforms and solutions as part of larger projects.
 
Backlog
 
As of April 30, 2021, our backlog was $0.2 million compared to a backlog of $1.0 million as of April 30, 2020. Our backlog includes unfilled firm orders for our products and services from commercial or governmental customers. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract.
 
The amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards.

Research and Development
 
Larger Power
 
We believe there is a near and longer-term demand for larger power for applications in several markets. The continued electrification of the seabed, together with the increased volume of sensors and vehicles available on the market, requires larger power devices in the <20kW range.
 
We continue to innovate through our research and development efforts to bring to market devices with power ranges larger than the hybrid and including other wave energy converter platforms beyond our current offerings. In parallel, the Company is investigating larger power alternatives, in cooperation with design and installation contractors, and other technical resources.
 
MDA-S
 
Expanding on our experience with our own initial prototype MSS system, we intend development of the next generation MDA-S, which will combine radar, marine automatic identification system (“AIS”) and camera data with a custom developed command and control system to provide actionable information for our end users. We believe the sensor suite will be a combination of off-the-shelf components selected to optimize performance and cost.
 
This system could be utilized as a standalone node or in an array, which we believe will provide near real-time information about the marine activity within a customer’s area of interest.
 
PB3 PowerBuoy®
 
We engaged our resources to improve PB3 efficiency, reliability and power output, and improve manufacturability while reducing cost and complexity. Our recent efforts have been focused on reducing the cost of our PB3 systems and their deployment costs in order to balance customer cost with our solution value proposition. We continue to seek to increase the capabilities of our PB3 systems by designing flexible interfaces and rendering them sensor and payload agnostic.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our technology differentiates us from other providers of wave energy conversion technologies. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation and may rely on licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
As of April 2021, we have been issued 66 U.S. patents, of which 41 are active, 14 have expired and 9 were abandoned. Outside of the U.S., we have been issued 239 patents across 15 countries with 20 of the active U.S. patents having at least one corresponding issued foreign patent. We have filed one additional U.S. patent application since April 29, 2020, and such patent application has four corresponding foreign patent applications at this time. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to:
 

● | system design; 
--+-------------------------------
● | control systems; 
● | power conversion; 
● | anchoring and mooring; and 
● | wave farm architecture. 

 
The expiration dates for our issued U.S. patents range from 2021 to 2039. We do not consider any single patent or patent application that we hold to be material to our business. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in continuing to obtain effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. In addition, certain technologies that we developed with U.S. federal government funding are subject to certain government rights as described in “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
We use trademarks on nearly all our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products. We have registered our PowerBuoy®, PB-Vue ®, PowerTower ®, Making Waves in Power ®, Talk on Water ® marks in the United States. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use.

Regulation
 
Our PowerBuoys® are subject to regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning, among other areas, site approval and environmental approval and compliance. In order to encourage the adoption of offshore power solutions, many governments offer subsidies and other financial incentives and have mandated renewable energy targets, which some of our customers may be able to leverage. However, these subsidies, incentives and targets may not be applicable to our technology and therefore may not be available to our customers.
 
The renewable energy industry has also been subject to increasing regulation. As the renewable energy industry continues to evolve and as the wave energy industry continues to evolve, we anticipate that wave energy technology and our PowerBuoys® and their deployment will be subject to increased oversight and regulation in accordance with international, national and local regulations relating to safety, sites, and environmental protection.
 
Site Approval. In the U.S., federal agencies regulate the siting of long-term renewable energy projects and related-uses located on the outer continental shelf (“OCS”), which is generally more than three miles offshore. OCS projects longer than one-year in duration are regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”). For projects located within three miles of the U.S. shore regardless of duration, the adjacent state would be responsible for issuing a lease and other required authorizations for the location of the project. In either case, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the project would be conducted in addition to other requirements. Generally, the same process applies to foreign sites where site approval is contingent on meeting both national and local regulatory and environmental requirements. In connection with issuing permits or leases enabling project use, the respective government agency often requires site restoration or other activities at the conclusion of the permit or lease period.
 
Environmental Approval, Compliance, and Health and Safety. We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, in the U.S., the construction and operation of PowerBuoys® offshore would require permits and approvals from the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other governmental authorities. These required permits and approvals evaluate, among other things, whether a project is in the public interest and ensure that the project would not create a hazard to navigation. Other foreign and international laws may require similar approvals.
 
Subsidies and Incentives. Renewable energy subsidies and incentives are generally applicable only to electric generation and supply to the utility grid. However, our autonomous applications may permit a customer to reduce its carbon emissions, which our potential customers may be able to publicize in their environmental stewardship reports.
 
Manufacturing
 
We engage in two types of manufacturing activities: 1) the manufacturing of the high value-added PTO components for systems control, power generation and conversion, and energy storage for each PB3; and 2) contracting with outside companies for the fabrication of the buoy structure, mooring system, and cabling.
 
Our core in-house manufacturing activity is the assembly, final systems integration and testing of the PTO and its components, which is conducted at our New Jersey facility. The power generation system consists of electro-mechanical components, and the control modules include the critical electrical and electronic systems that convert the mechanical energy into usable electricity. The sensors and control systems use sophisticated technology to optimize the performance of the PB3 in response to changing operating conditions and payload power demand. We maintain a portfolio of patents, including those that cover our power generation, power conversion and control technologies.
 
We purchase the remaining components and materials for each PB3 from various vendors. We provide specifications to each vendor, and they are responsible for performing quality analysis and quality control over the course of construction, subject to our review of the quality and test procedure results. After the vendor completes the testing of the buoy structure, it is transported to our facility for final integration of the PTO. We do not believe that we are dependent on any single vendor for manufacturing the components of and materials for our PB3, and we believe that there are many available manufacturers for our component parts if a particular manufacturing partner should become unavailable or too expensive. However, we have only manufactured our PB3 in limited quantities for use in development and testing and have limited commercial manufacturing experience, and our work with our vendors has not included work on multiple orders on time-critical deadlines. Moreover, we do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers or vendors. In order to be successful in our efforts to commercialize our PB3, we will need to secure stable relationships with a variety of manufacturers and vendors that can supply component parts and materials for our PB3 products.
 
Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Monroe Township, New Jersey. Our facility offers approximately 56,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space. This facility allows for expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and a move toward higher volume production of our solutions. The Company also has a lease for office workspace located in Houston, Texas which is used by business development and sales personnel. The Company also has one lease for 2,046 square feet of office space, also located in Houston, Texas that was acquired as part of the 3Dent acquisition. We believe these offices are suitable, adequate and provide productive capacity for the Company.

Continuous employee engagement helps us understand our employees’ perspectives and identify areas for additional focus.
 
The Company aims to ensure that its employees have a healthy and safe work environment, which include policies to guide our efforts. We take a proactive approach to the identification and control of environment, health and safety risks. We work to continuously improve our Health, Safety, and Environment (“HSE”) performance through methodologies that aim to prevent workplace injuries and illness and provide ongoing education to employees. On June 2, 2021, the Company achieved ISO 45001 certification for a 3-year term, expiring on June 1, 2024. Additionally, our safety focus was evident during our response to the coronavirus pandemic, where we implemented additional health and safety measures, including rigorous cleaning protocols at our facility, enhanced sanitization, social distancing, temperature screenings, cloth facemasks and hand sanitizers.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
The Company recognizes the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) as essential elements to its success and it strives to deliver innovative products and solutions while working with high integrity, a strong governance culture and respect for human rights. The Company believes that consideration of ESG matters is important to how it, and its solutions and services affect the environments and societies in which it operates around the world. In addition, the Company consistently drives to meet its regulatory standards and requirements around HSE protection. The Company also views itself as a responsible corporate citizen throughout the execution of its operations, which is emphasized in its goal to provide zero-carbon and low-carbon power and data solutions for offshore industries, scientific research and territorial security. It is the goal that all Company products have minimal environmental impact when compared to other potential solutions. Lastly, the Company also has had a growing commitment to its local communities through volunteering and internship programs. The Company has volunteer days for its employees and provides internship opportunities to local college students, and in 2020, the Company fabricated and donated face shields for first responders and medical personnel throughout New Jersey.

   Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic presented substantial health and economic risks, uncertainties and challenges to our business, the global economy, and financial markets. In March 2020, one of the Company’s customers cancelled a portion of their contract due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and instead extended an existing lease. In April 2020, the Company declared force majeure on a contract with a different customer and delayed the deployment of its PB3 PowerBouy® in Chile. For additional information on various uncertainties and risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this report.
 
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Government passed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the (“CARES Act”). On May 3, 2020, the Company signed a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan with Santander Bank, N.A. (“Santander”) as the lender for $890,347 in support through the Small Business Association (“SBA”) under the PPP loan. The PPP loan is unsecured and evidenced by a note in favor of Santander as the lender and governed by a Loan Agreement with Santander. The interest rate is 1% and the loan is repayable over two years. The loan contains customary events of defaults relating to, among other things, payment defaults or breaches of the terms of the loan. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender may require immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts under the loan. Interest and principal payments are deferred for the first 6 months from the date of the loan. Principal and interest are payable monthly commencing 6 months after the disbursement date and may be repaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Company received the proceeds on May 5, 2020.
 
 The Company filed its loan forgiveness application at the end of February 2021 asking for 100% forgiveness of the loan. In June 2021, the Company was informed that its application was approved, and the loan is now fully forgiven.
