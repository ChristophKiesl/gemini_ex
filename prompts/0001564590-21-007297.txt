ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (“AWI” or the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891.  When we refer to “we,” “our” and “us” in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.
 We are a leading producer of ceiling systems for use in the construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling and wall systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, wood fiber, glass-reinforced-gypsum and felt) throughout the Americas.
 As an Americas-based ceilings and walls company, we are focused on driving profitable topline growth by growing our core business and expanding into new, adjacent business categories and sectors. Our key strategic initiatives aim to align to these objectives and leverage our strengths. Our initiatives are designed to enable us to: (i) lead in innovation and launch new products; (ii) expand our portfolio of solutions and manufacturing capabilities through a pipeline of acquisitions, partnerships and alliances, as well as new programs focused on the sustainability of our products and operations; (iii) lead in solutions design; (iv) expand category and sector access within the commercial and residential construction markets; (v) build and deliver compelling value propositions; and (vi) optimize service to our customers. 
 Through our expanding architectural specialties offerings, bolstered by our recent acquisitions, our continuously evolving innovative core ceilings portfolio, including our Healthy Spaces products, Total Acoustics® solutions and Sustain® family of products; and our development of digitally enabled systems and tools, we are increasing our capabilities to sell into more spaces and sell more into every space. 
 Acquisitions
 In December 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of Arktura LLC (“Arktura”) and certain subsidiaries with operations in the United States and Argentina. Arktura is a designer and fabricator of metal and felt ceilings, walls, partitions and facades with one manufacturing facility based in Los Angeles, California. 
 In August 2020, we acquired the business and assets of Moz Designs, Inc. (“Moz”), based in Oakland, California. Moz is a designer and fabricator of custom architectural metal ceilings, walls, dividers and column covers for interior and exterior applications with one manufacturing facility.
In July 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of TURF Design, Inc. (“Turf”), with one manufacturing facility in Elgin, Illinois and a design center in Chicago, Illinois. Turf is a designer and manufacturer of acoustic felt ceilings and wall products. 
 In November 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK Industries, Inc. (“MRK”), based in Libertyville, Illinois. MRK is a manufacturer of specialty metal ceiling, wall and exterior solutions with one manufacturing facility. 
 In March 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Architectural Components Group, Inc. (“ACGI”), based in Marshfield, Missouri. ACGI is a manufacturer of custom wood ceilings and walls with one manufacturing facility. 
 In August 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings, Inc. (“Steel Ceilings”), based in Johnstown, Ohio. Steel Ceilings is a manufacturer of aluminum and stainless metal ceilings that include architectural, radiant and security solutions with one manufacturing facility. 
 In May 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. (“Plasterform”), based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Plasterform is a manufacturer of architectural cast ceilings, walls, facades, columns and moldings with one manufacturing facility. 
 The operations, assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are included in our Architectural Specialties segment.
 Discontinued Operations
 On September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (“EMEA”) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (“WAVE”), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. (“Worthington”) in which AWI holds a 50% interest (collectively, the “Sale”), to Knauf International GmbH (“Knauf”). The purchase price of $330.0 million was previously paid by Knauf to us during 2018 and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments for cash and debt as provided in the 
 5


Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between us and Knauf (the “Purchase Agreement”), including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment. During 2020, we remitted $25.9 million to WAVE for their remaining portion of the proceeds from Knauf. Also during 2020, WAVE paid each of AWI and Worthington dividends of $13.0 million relating to these payments. During the third quarter of 2020, we remitted $6.4 million to Knauf for working capital and other adjustments. In January 2021, we finalized the post-closing adjustments to purchase price related to certain pension liabilities assumed by Knauf in the Sale. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a $12.0 million loss primarily related to this purchase price adjustment, which is reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2020. 
 
In 2019, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Knauf for its benefit and the benefit of a buyer of certain businesses divested by Knauf, pursuant to which we provided certain transition technology, finance and information technology support services. The Transition Services Agreement expired in 2020. In connection with the closing of the Sale, we also entered into (i) a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf under which they, and the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf, license patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in licensed territories in which the business was conducted prior to the Sale, and (ii) a Supply Agreement with Knauf under which the parties may continue to purchase certain products from each other following the closing of the Sale. WAVE also entered into similar agreements with Knauf for such purposes. The term of the granted licenses, with respect to each intellectual property right, extend until the expiration or abandonment of each such intellectual property right.
 The EMEA and Pacific Rim segment historical financial results through September 30, 2019 have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as discontinued operations for all periods presented, while the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been removed from AWI’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019.  
 See Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions and discontinued operations.
 Markets
 We are well positioned in the industry sectors and categories in which we operate, often holding a leadership position. Our products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall and a wide range of specialty ceiling products.  We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. The major markets in which we compete are:
 Commercial Construction.  Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings.  Renovation work (also known as replacement/remodel) is estimated to represent the majority of the commercial market opportunity.  Most of our revenue comes from the following sectors of commercial construction – office, education, transportation, healthcare and retail.  We monitor U.S. construction starts and project activity.  Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 24 months.  We also monitor office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, state and local government spending, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities.  We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction.  Additionally, we believe that customer preferences for product type, style, color, performance attributes (such as acoustics, sustainability and health attributes), availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue. 
 In our Mineral Fiber segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial construction market sales are used for existing building renovation purposes by end-users of our products.  In our Architectural Specialties segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial market sales are used for new building construction by end-users of our products. The end-use of our products is based on management estimates as such information is not easily determinable. 
 Residential Construction.  We also sell mineral fiber products for use in single and multi-family housing. We estimate that existing home renovation work represents the majority of the residential construction market opportunity.  Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.  
Customers
 We use our reputation, capabilities, service, innovation and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers.  We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. We have important relationships with national 
 6


home centers such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., with wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers, and also with architects and designers who specify products. 
 In 2020, approximately 70% of our consolidated net sales are to distributors.  Sales to large home centers accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales.  Our remaining sales are primarily to direct customers and retailers.  
 Gross sales to commercial distributors GMS Inc. and Foundation Building Materials, Inc. totaled $370.3 million and individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated gross sales in 2020. These sales were included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments.
 Working Capital
 We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers.  Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements.  We sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future.  These practices are typical within the industry.  
Competition
 The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.  Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price.  Competition comes from both domestic and international manufacturers.  Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions, namely, drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum).  Excess industry capacity exists for certain products, which tends to increase price competition.  The following companies are our primary competitors:
 CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by Rockwool International A/S), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rockfon A/S (owned by Rockwool International A/S), USG Corporation (owned by Gebr. Knauf KG), Ceilings Plus (owned by USG Corporation), Rulon International, and 9Wood.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business.  The principal raw materials include: clays, felt, fiberglass, perlite, pigment, recycled paper, starch, wood and wood fiber.  We manufacture most of the production needs for mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities.  Finally, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid.
 We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.
 In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations.  However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers.  There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.
 Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically.  Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs.  Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.
 Sourced Products
 Some of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties.  Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products.  We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Europe and the Pacific Rim.  Sales of sourced products represented approximately 9% of our total consolidated revenue in 2020.
 In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products.  However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.

Seasonality
 Generally, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction. In comparison to the prior year, sales were weaker in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 due to reduced demand related to COVID-19. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
 Patent protection is important to our business.  Our competitive position has been enhanced by patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses.  In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
 Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.  The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies.  Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
 Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation,  , Armstrong®, 24/7 Defend™, ACOUSTIBuilt™, AirAssure™, Airtite®, Arktura®, Calla®, Cirrus®, Cortega®, DESIGNFlex®, Dune™, Feltworks®, Humiguard®, Infusions®, InvisAcoustics™, Kanopi™, Lyra®, MetalWorks™, Moz™, Optima®, Plasterform™, Soundscapes®, Sustain®, Tectum®, Total Acoustics®, Turf®, Ultima®, and WoodWorks®, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition.  Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
 In connection with the separation and distribution of our former flooring business into a separate publicly-traded company, Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (“AFI”), in 2016, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI.  These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the “Armstrong” trade name and logo.  Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a royalty-free license to utilize the “Inspiring Great Spaces” tagline, logo and related color scheme, which expires December 31, 2021.
 In connection with the closing of the Sale, we entered into a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf for its benefit (and, under sublicense, to the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf) under which they license certain patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in certain licensed territories.
 We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks at least annually for potential impairment.  See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Sustainability and Environmental Matters
 As a leading building products manufacturer, we are committed to operating sustainably across all areas of our business. This commitment is reflected in our ongoing initiatives to design and develop sustainable ceiling and wall products and solutions for every space. Sustainability in our business reflects our mission to make a difference in the lives of people where they live, work, learn, heal and play. Sustainability is designed to support our strategic priorities, align with stakeholder interests, and be visible and measurable. 
 Our sustainability function is organized around three program “pillars”: People, Planet and Product. 
 Under the People pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on increasing our engagement in the communities where we operate, evaluating our benefits and compensation structure for all levels of the organization, promoting and maintaining a diverse, talented and growing workforce, encouraging and protecting human rights, and creating a safe working environment for our employees. 
 Under the Planet pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on reducing our greenhouse gas footprint, reducing or recapturing water in our operations, and reducing waste in our operations. These efforts include our ceilings recycling program, which diverts reclaimed ceiling tiles from landfills, and our reduction of our environmental operating footprint. Additionally, we are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.
 8


Under the Product pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on ensuring our products are free of chemicals of concern, reducing our products’ water and greenhouse gas footprint, and continuing to invest in solutions that meet customer demand for building products that align with their sustainability goals. We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers, including through our Sustain® portfolio, will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.  
 The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.
 Human Capital
 Workforce Demographics.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately 2,700 and 2,500 full time and part time employees, respectively. The increase in employees was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Arktura, Moz and Turf during 2020. During 2020, our total voluntary and involuntary turnover rates were approximately 5% and 3%, respectively, for non-production employees and 12% and 6%, respectively, for production employees.
 As of December 31, 2020, approximately 59% of our approximately 1,300 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions.  Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 500 employees at two U.S. plants will expire during 2021. We believe that our relations with our employees are constructive and positive. 
 Employee Health and Safety.  Safety is a core value at Armstrong and our culture is committed to making safety a personal core value for every employee.  Our overall goal is to eliminate workplace injuries. We promote and foster an environment of empowerment and sharing throughout the company at all levels and in all locations. We engage our employees on safety with a focus on risk identification and elimination and through various leading indicators. We track Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recordable injuries and lost time rates by location monthly. We establish safety targets annually, which are tracked and reported to leadership monthly and reviewed with our Board of Directors.    
 We offer competitive health and wellness benefits to eligible employees and periodically conduct analyses of plan utilization to further tailor our employee benefits to meet their ongoing needs. In response to COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines from governmental and local health authorities across our facilities and have implemented preventative measures that include working remotely, providing personal protective equipment, limiting group meetings, enhancing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and social distancing. Employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely are doing so, and a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in mid-March 2020 and were continuing to telework as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, we implemented an Emergency Paid Leave policy for all employees which expired on December 31, 2020. This policy granted additional paid time off for any employee impacted by COVID-19. We implemented a COVID Leave Program effective January 1, 2021 that continues to provide similar benefits for employees impacted by COVID-19.
 Diversity and Inclusion.  We continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity and inclusion, as we believe it is a key to our future success. This commitment is most recently reflected in the goals of the People Pillar of our Sustainability program, which is being led by our VP Talent Sustainability, who was hired in 2020. We measure gender and racial/ethnic representation and are focusing on our incoming new hires to assist in increasing diversity within the company. In addition, we are committed to engaging in events and outreach that align with our goals to enhance our diversity and inclusion. Our strategy to grow our diversity over time includes (1) providing annual training to employees on diversity and inclusion topics, (2) demonstrating year over year improvement in the diversity of our organization measured by representation of female, minorities and veterans at every level of the organization, and (3) providing employees an annual opportunity to share their views on topics that matter to them.
Research & Development
 Research and development (“R&D”) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products’ competitiveness.  Principal R&D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.

Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
 Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. We are one of several potentially responsible parties in these matters and have agreed to jointly fund required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability.  We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  
 Most of our facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment.  We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.
 On September 8, 2017, Roxul USA, Inc. (d/b/a Rockfon) (“Rockfon”) filed litigation against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Court”) alleging anticompetitive conduct seeking remedial measures and unspecified damages.  Roxul USA, Inc. is a significant ceilings systems competitor with global headquarters in Europe and expanding operations in the Americas.  On April 3, 2019, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Rockfon to fully resolve the litigation between us, and Rockfon filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice (“Dismissal”) with the Court.  Pursuant to the Dismissal, Rockfon formally dismissed all claims it had against AWI with prejudice.  All claims in the litigation have been fully and finally dismissed and released with AWI making a payment to Rockfon for its costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees.  Pursuant to the settlement, both parties acknowledged that (a) AWI denies all claims of wrongdoing and makes no admission of wrongdoing or of the truth of any of the claims or allegations contained in Rockfon’s complaint or otherwise alleged in the litigation; (b) all AWI exclusive distribution locations (i.e., any location where a reseller has agreed to sell only AWI ceiling system products) will remain exclusive to AWI under their respective distribution agreements, and (c) in all other non-exclusive or “open” distribution locations, resellers are free to purchase and resell ceiling systems products of any manufacturer at their discretion. During 2019, we incurred $19.7 million of expenses in connection with the matter, primarily relating to legal and professional fees incurred by us in connection with the litigation, including expenses and attorney’s fees paid under the settlement agreement. As a result of the settlement and Dismissal, we do not expect to incur additional future costs or expenses relating to the matter.
 From time to time, we are involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. In connection with those matters, we may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands.  While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of any proceedings relating to these matters, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Liabilities of $1.2 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made.  See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
