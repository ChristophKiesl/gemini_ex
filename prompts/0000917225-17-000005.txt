Item 1. Business
The Company
 
Solitario Exploration & Royalty Corp. (“Solitario,” “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is an exploration stage company at December 31, 2016 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by the SEC. Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ("Crown"). In July 1994, Solitario became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) through its initial public offering. We have been actively involved in mineral exploration since 1993. Our primary business is to acquire exploration mineral properties or royalties on mineral properties, and/or to discover economic deposits on our mineral properties and advance these deposits, either on our own or through joint ventures, up to the development stage (development activities include, among other things, completion of a feasibility study for the identification of proven and probable reserves, as well as permitting and preparing a deposit for mining). At that point, or sometime prior to that point, we would likely attempt to sell a given mineral property, pursue its development either on our own, or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations, or obtain a royalty from a third party that continues to advance the property. In addition to focusing on our current assets and the evaluation of mineral properties for acquisition or purchase of royalty interests, we also evaluate potential strategic corporate transactions for the potential acquisition of new precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential or business combinations we determine to be favorable to Solitario.
 
Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC
 
On August 25, 2015, we, along with DHI Minerals (US) Ltd. (“DHI”), sold our combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton gold project to Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC, (“Waterton”) for total cash proceeds of US$30 million (the “Transaction”) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on June 10, 2015 (the “Agreement”). We sold our 80% interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC (“MH-LLC”), a limited liability company which held 100% of the Mt. Hamilton project assets, and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC. DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely Gold and Minerals, Inc. (“Ely”). We received gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million. Our costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional service fees, were $439,000. The Transaction was structured as the sale of DHI’s and our combined membership interests in MH-LLC. We recorded a gain on sale related to the Transaction of $12,309,000. Concurrent with the closing of the Transaction, we paid $5,000,000 plus $7,000 of interest and fees to fully repay the funds we had borrowed (the “RMB Loan”) pursuant to a facility agreement (the “Facility Agreement”) with RMB Australia Holdings Limited (“RMBAH”) and RMB Resources, Inc. (“RMBR”).

At December 31, 2016, we had three mineral exploration properties in Peru and our Yanacocha royalty property in Peru, a retained royalty on the Pedra Branca project in Brazil, a retained royalty on the Norcan and Aconchi non-producing exploration properties in Mexico, and during 2016 we acquired a royalty on certain non-producing mineral claims in Montana. We are conducting exploration activities and limited property evaluation activities in those countries either on our own using contract geologists, or through joint ventures operated by our partners.
 
Our exploration activities and those of our joint venture partners are carried out on a property-by-property basis. When these activities, including drilling, sampling and geologic testing, indicate a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential, we may impair or completely write-off the property. Another significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of gold is down, the value of any of our gold-bearing mineral exploration properties decreases; however, it may also become easier and less expensive to locate and acquire new gold-bearing mineral exploration properties with potential to have economic deposits.
 
Our current and near-term future exploration activities in Peru consist of reconnaissance exploration for the identification of new properties for acquisition, as well as evaluation of strategic corporate opportunities and ongoing exploration activities on our existing exploration projects through the use of contract geologists, and oversight of our joint ventures in Peru that are managed by our partners.
 
Solitario has recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on its formerly-held Mt. Hamilton property. Proceeds from the sale or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent source of cash and may only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. Accordingly, while we conduct exploration activities on our projects, we need to maintain and replenish our capital resources. We have met our need for capital in the past through (i) proceeds of the Transaction; (ii) sale of our shares of common stock of Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”); (iii) borrowing in the form of short-term margin debt secured by our investment in Kinross; (iv) borrowing under the Facility Agreement (v) joint venture delay rental payments, including payments on our Bongará project; (vi) a royalty sale for $10,000,000 in 2012; (vii) issuance of common stock; (viii) sale of covered call options on our Kinross common stock; and (ix) interest on short term Treasury Notes and Bank CDs. In the past, we have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities through the use of joint ventures.
 
We operate in one segment, mineral exploration. We currently conduct exploration activities in Peru and exploration evaluation activities throughout North and South America, including Canada, Peru, Mexico and the United States. As of March, 10, 2017, we had five full-time employees, located in the United States and no full-time employees outside of the United States. We utilize contract managers, geologists and laborers to execute our Latin American project work and acquisition evaluations.
 
A large number of companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties, many of which have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we have and, accordingly, we may be at a disadvantage in being able to compete effectively for the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We are not aware of any single competitor or group of competitors that dominate the exploration and development of mineral properties. In acquiring mineral properties for exploration and development, we rely on the experience, technical expertise and knowledge of our employees and advisors, which is limited by the size of our company compared to many of our competitors who may have either more employees or employees with more specialized knowledge and experience.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Mineral development and exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.  Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We are required to obtain the licenses, permits and other authorizations in order to conduct our exploration programs.
Environmental Regulations
 
Our current and planned activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We are required to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we conduct our exploration activities could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. During 2016, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.
