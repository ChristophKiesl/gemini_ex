Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of California in June 1981 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on September 25, 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 14282 Franklin Avenue, Tustin, California, 92780 and our telephone number is (714) 508-6000. Our Internet website addresses are www.peregrineinc.com and www.avidbio.com. Information contained on, or accessed through, our websites does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients by manufacturing high quality pharmaceutical products through our contract manufacturing business, Avid Bioservices, Inc. (“Avid”), and by advancing and licensing our novel, development-stage immunotherapy product through our research and development business, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Peregrine”).
 
Peregrine is focused primarily on the research and development of immune stimulating therapies for the treatment of various cancers. Avid, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peregrine, is our contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) business.
 
In June 2016, following the discontinuation of our bavituximab Phase III SUNRISE trial, we announced a shift in our corporate focus toward achieving profitability within two (2) years (during the quarter ending July 31, 2018). This was to be achieved by focusing on revenue growth from our contract manufacturing business, Avid, while also reducing our spending on research and development while continuing to collect and evaluate data from the Phase III SUNRISE trial. We believe we made significant progress towards this goal during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017 by reducing research and development expenses by fifty-two percent (52%) while simultaneously growing Avid revenues by thirty percent (30%), as compared to the prior fiscal year. The result was a reduction of our net loss by 49% to $28,159,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017.

While reducing research and development expenses over the past fiscal year, we have also been able to allow the clinical data from the Phase III SUNRISE trial to mature, enabling us to conduct and present data analysis at key scientific meetings that support the clinical development of bavituximab with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. While we currently expect to reduce research and development spending by at least 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, this reduction in spending will not allow us to advance the bavituximab clinical program through a company sponsored trial. Instead, we are collaborating with leading immunotherapy experts and institutions to continue to drive forward our research and further guide our clinical development program.
 
With respect to our CDMO business, fiscal year 2017 was a record year for revenues, topping $57 million and representing 30% revenue growth over the prior fiscal year. While we are pleased at the continued year over year revenue growth, we have also recently seen unanticipated decreases in manufacturing demand from our largest customer and a recent regulatory filing delay from our second largest customer which will have some impact on our ability to grow the revenues from our CDMO business in fiscal year 2018 and could impact our ability to achieve overall profitability by the quarter ending July 31, 2018. However, we believe this to be temporary delay in revenue growth during fiscal year 2018 and have recently secured four new customers and are continuing to focus on securing additional customer business in order to better diversify our customer base. Our goal is to maintain profitability for Avid over the short term while positioning the business for long-term growth and attracting the resources necessary to continue to advance our promising research and development efforts.
 
Importantly, we continually evaluate various strategic options that we believe may enable us to enhance stockholder value, including the possible separation of these two distinct businesses.
 
Avid—Our CDMO Business
 
Avid provides fully-integrated current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) services from cell line development to commercial biomanufacturing of large molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins for third-party customers while also supporting Peregrine’s internal drug development business. We believe this integration offers considerable time and cost efficiencies for our internal drug development business.
 
We have been developing and manufacturing biologics since 1993 in our Franklin biomanufacturing facility (the “Franklin Facility”) located at our current headquarters in Tustin, California and formed Avid in 2002 to offer these services to third-party customers. These services include cGMP clinical and commercial product manufacturing utilizing stainless steel and single use bioreactor technology, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing and regulatory strategy and support. Avid also provides a variety of process development activities, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization.
 
In March 2016, Avid expanded its manufacturing capacity through the launch of its Myford biomanufacturing facility (the “Myford Facility”), which doubled our manufacturing capacity. The 42,000 square foot facility, which is our second manufacturing facility, can accommodate single-use bioreactors up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale. The Myford Facility was designed to accommodate a fully disposable manufacturing process for products in late stage clinical development to commercial. To date, the Myford Facility has been utilized to complete a number of process validation runs for our third-party customers, which may lead to future commercial production, and has supported the process validation of our lead immunotherapy candidate, bavituximab. The Myford Facility is located adjacent to our Franklin Facility.
 
As we look to expand the manufacturing capacity of our CDMO business, in February 2017, we leased an additional 42,000 square feet of vacant warehouse space within the same building as our existing Myford Facility. The proximity of this space will allow us to utilize existing manufacturing infrastructure that we believe should enhance our manufacturing efficiencies and reduce the overall cost and timeframe to construct a third biomanufacturing facility. Although we previously anticipated that the new manufacturing facility would be constructed and ready for manufacturing activities by mid-calendar year 2018, due to unanticipated changes in and/or timing of customer demand (as discussed above), we have decided to defer construction of this third facility until demand from existing or potential new customers is expected to exceed the current manufacturing capacity at our Franklin Facility and Myford Facility. Additionally, commencement of construction is also subject to our ability to raise sufficient additional capital to support this expansion effort. As a result, we presently do not expect to commence construction of this third facility prior to April 30, 2018.

To date, Avid has been audited and qualified by large and small, domestic and foreign, biotechnology companies interested in the production of biologic material for clinical and commercial use. Additionally, Avid has been audited by several regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Canadian Health Authority and the California Department of Health.
 
Fiscal Year 2018 Key Objectives—Our CDMO Business
 
Our key objectives for our contract manufacturing business in the coming fiscal year include:
 

· | Expand our manufacturing capacity through the installation and validation of two 2,000 liter single use bioreactors in our Myford Facility to support the anticipated needs of a current customer; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to diversify our customer base by securing additional customers to support our future revenue growth beyond fiscal year 2018.

Peregrine—Our Research and Development Business
 
Peregrine is developing therapeutics designed to fight cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that tumors establish in order to proliferate. By doing so, these therapeutics allow the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells.
 
Bavituximab is our lead immunotherapy candidate and currently we are collaborating with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (“NCCN”) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”), to evaluate the potential of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies.
 
Bavituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and binds to phosphatidylserine (“PS”), a highly immunosuppressive molecule that is usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells, but then “flips” and becomes exposed on the outside of cells in the tumor microenvironment, causing the tumor to evade immune detection. Bavituximab targets and binds to PS to block this immunosuppressive pathway and simultaneously activates adaptive immunity, thereby enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the tumor.
 
Clinical Development Strategy
 
In June 2016, we announced a clinical development strategy focused on conducting small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. These trials may be conducted independently, in conjunction with our collaborators, or through investigator sponsored trials (“ISTs”). The goal of these trials is to generate compelling clinical and translational data demonstrating bavituximab’s immunotherapeutic mechanism of action in a combination treatment setting. Additionally, we are in the process of completing an extensive review and analysis of the available data from the discontinued Phase III SUNRISE trial discussed below and testing the numerous collected samples for potential biomarkers in order to determine if certain subgroups may have benefited more from the bavituximab treatment. We believe such information will assist us in guiding the bavituximab clinical program. In keeping with this strategy, we are evaluating options to advance clinical development of bavituximab in an efficient and cost-effective way.
 
We believe this strategy will allow us to (i) continue our research and development activities while avoiding costly, later stage clinical trials, thereby allowing us to achieve profitability sooner, and (ii) generate additional data that we believe, if positive, could create future potential value, including attracting potential licensing partners or re-engaging our collaboration with AstraZeneca.

NCCN Collaboration
 
In January 2016, we announced that we entered into a research collaboration with NCCN, a not-for-profit alliance of 27 of the world’s leading cancer centers, to expand the clinical research and development of bavituximab for the treatment of a range of tumors. Under this research collaboration, we are funding three ISTs and related correlative studies with bavituximab at NCCN member institutions and their affiliate community hospitals through a $2 million research grant to NCCN’s Oncology Research Program.  NCCN is responsible for oversight and monitoring of the three clinical studies awarded under the research grant. In September 2016, NCCN announced that investigators at the following NCCN-affiliated institutions received the grant award:
 

1. | Moffitt Cancer Center—A Phase I Trial of Sorafenib and Bavituximab Plus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Hepatitis C Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma. This trial is open for enrollment.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center—Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Bavituximab with Radiation and Temozolomide for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma. This trial is open for enrollment.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins—Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab and Bavituximab for Progressive Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck. We expect this trial to be initiated by the end of the calendar year 2017.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MSKCC Collaboration
 
In May 2015, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with investigators at MSKCC to identify effective treatment combinations based on our PS-targeting agents, including bavituximab, with other checkpoint inhibitors or immune stimulating agents that will further guide our clinical development program.
 
In November 2016, we announced initial results from our collaboration with the investigators at MSKCC at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. Study results highlighted that PS-targeting antibodies similar to bavituximab synergize with checkpoint inhibitors and radiation to improve anti-tumor activity in various animal tumor models.
 
A team of MSKCC researchers evaluated the effects of combining PS-targeting, anti-PD-1 and radiation therapies in the mouse B16 melanoma model.  Study data showed that PS-targeting antibodies synergize with both anti-PD-1 and radiation therapy to improve anti-cancer activity.  PS-targeting treatment in combination with radiation, as well as triple combination of PS-targeting treatment, anti-PD-1 and radiation, led to a reduction in tumor burden.  Median survival for the triple combination treatment still had not been reached at the end of the 80-day observation period, while other arms in the study showed median survival that ranged from 24–70 days.
 
Researchers also evaluated the impact of the PS-targeting and radiation combination treatment on the level and type of immune activity. These results demonstrated that the combination led to a change in the tumor microenvironment, shifting it from immunosuppressive in which tumors are protected to immune-active in which tumors are more susceptible to treatment. Analysis of local immune responses in the tumors of the treated animals showed that the combination treatment increased the number of tumor associated macrophages and shifted the macrophage polarization from the immunosuppressive M2 type to the immune active M1 type. When systemic immune responses were analyzed following the triple combination of PS-targeting, anti-PD-1 and radiation therapies, researchers also saw evidence of increased immune activity. This was illustrated by key indicators of immune activity, including increases in CD8+ T–cell activation, effector cytokine production and differentiation into effector memory cells.
 
In April 2017, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”), researchers from MSKCC presented preclinical study results highlighting the potential of our PS-targeting antibodies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of adoptive T cell transfer therapy without triggering off-target toxicities. The researchers evaluated and compared the anti-tumor activity and off-target toxicities of adoptive T cell transfer therapy in combination with either PS-targeting antibodies or anti-OX40 antibodies in mice with advanced melanomas. Whereas PS-targeting and anti-OX40 demonstrated comparable tumor regression when administered in combination with transferred adoptive T cells, only the PS-targeting combination achieved these results without any detectable off-target toxicities. By contrast, the anti-OX40 treatment combination triggered off-target inflammatory destruction of healthy tissues. Additional study results demonstrated that the PS-targeting antibodies decreased tumor-induced immunosuppression as evidenced by a decrease in immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages.

The preclinical data from both of these studies has further supported our belief that bavituximab modulates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhances the activity of other immunotherapy agents. MSKCC continues to evaluate bavituximab with other immunotherapy agents, which will further guide our clinical development program.
 
Phase III SUNRISE Trial
 
In December 2013, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial evaluating bavituximab plus docetaxel, versus docetaxel plus placebo, for the treatment of previously-treated NSCLC (the “Phase III SUNRISE trial”).
 
In February 2016, we announced that we were discontinuing the Phase III SUNRISE trial based on the recommendation of the study’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee following a pre-specified interim analysis performed after 33% of targeted overall events (patient deaths). Results of the analysis demonstrated that the patients treated in the bavituximab plus docetaxel treatment arm did not show a sufficient improvement in overall survival as compared to the patients treated in the docetaxel plus placebo treatment arm to warrant continuation of the study. Patient enrollment was discontinued and existing patients in the trial were given the choice to continue chemotherapy and/or bavituximab, as appropriate. Patient treatment and follow-up data from the trial were collected through March 2017 and the trial is now closed.
 
Following the discontinuation of the Phase III SUNRISE trial, we promptly initiated and are nearing completion of an extensive review and analysis of the available data and testing the numerous collected samples for potential biomarkers in order to understand what subgroups may have benefited more from the bavituximab treatment. We believe such information will be important in supporting and refining our clinical strategy, as discussed above.
 
The most compelling data to date was presented in April 2017 at the Annual Meeting of the AACR. In a subgroup analysis, we looked at the outcome of 91 patients that were enrolled in the Phase III SUNRISE trial that were subsequently treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICI’s”) post study treatments. The results from this analysis demonstrated that the patients who received docetaxel plus bavituximab and subsequent ICI’s (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) had not yet reached median overall survival (“mOS”) compared to mOS of 13.0 months for patients who received docetaxel plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; p=0.005). The statistically significant difference between the two arms in the trial provides strong rationale for combining bavituximab with ICI’s and supports the hypothesis that bavituximab may modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance the anti-tumor activity of ICI’s.
 
In June 2017, we announced additional supportive data at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) demonstrating that patients in the bavituximab containing arm who had low baseline PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (i.e., patients typically with poorer response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors) lived significantly longer than patients with high baseline PD-L1 expression. These data further support the hypothesis that bavituximab may modulate the tumor microenvironment to complement and enhance the anti-tumor activity of ICI’s.
 
Antibody Discovery Technology
 
Recently, our scientists have developed an antibody discovery and characterization platform through which we can generate antibodies against virtually any target. These capabilities are state-of-the-art and meant for rapid screening for high affinity antibodies as drug candidates. These capabilities are a natural extension of the services we already offer through Avid and it may represent a way to bring in customers at a much earlier stage of development with the potential to move them quickly into process development and cGMP manufacturing. Continuing to diversify our customer base is one of our key initiatives at Avid and we believe the antibody discovery capabilities will help attract new customers. The antibody discovery capabilities can also be used in our research and development business to rapidly identify antibodies against known targets as well as to identify novel targets. The antibody discovery platform is now fully functional and we are in the process of evaluating the technology through identifying several known targets and thus far, the results have looked promising. Once this process is completed, the technology platform will be marketed to potential customers as part of our CDMO service offerings.

Exosome Technology
 
We licensed from The University of Texas System, on behalf of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (“UTSWMC”) in July 2016, proprietary exosome-based cancer diagnostic technology, with the goal of developing an optimized test for further clinical testing in collaboration with a potential partner. The platform is based on the diagnostic potential of tumor derived exosomes, which are small vesicles from tumor cells that are released into the blood as tumors grow. Tumor derived exosomes have PS on their surface as a potentially detectable marker. It is believed that even small tumors begin to release PS-positive exosomes and thus the ability to detect these exosomes in the blood may be an indicator of the presence of a tumor.
 
In the study published by Oncotarget, plasma samples from 34 patients with ovarian tumors and 10 healthy subjects were analyzed for the presence of PS-expressing exosomes in a blinded test. Results demonstrated that those patients with malignant ovarian cancer displayed significantly higher blood PS exosome levels than those with benign tumors (median 0.237 vs. -0.027, p=0.0001) and the malignant and benign groups displayed significantly higher blood PS exosome levels than the healthy subjects (median 0.237 vs -0.158, p < 0.0001 and -0.027 vs -0.158, p=0.0002, respectively).
 
Fiscal Year 2018 Objectives—Our Research and Development Business

Reverse Stock Split
 
On July 7, 2017, we effected a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one-for-seven, which took effect with the opening of trading on July 10, 2017. All common stock share and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted to give effect to the one-for-seven reverse stock split, retrospectively.
 
In-Licensing Agreements
 
The following is a summary of our key in-licensing agreements covering bavituximab, our lead immunotherapy product in clinical development.
 
In August 2001 and August 2005, we exclusively in-licensed the worldwide rights to the PS-targeting technology platform, including bavituximab, from The University of Texas System, on behalf of UTSWMC. In November 2003, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”), to license certain intellectual property rights covering methods and processes for producing antibodies used in connection with the development of our PS-targeting program. In December 2003, we entered into an exclusive commercial license agreement with Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (“Avanir”) covering the generation of a chimeric monoclonal antibody. In March 2005, we entered into a worldwide non-exclusive license agreement with Lonza Biologics (“Lonza”) for intellectual property and materials relating to the expression of recombinant monoclonal antibodies for use in the manufacture of bavituximab.

Under our in-licensing agreements relating to bavituximab, we are obligated to pay future milestone payments based on potential clinical development and regulatory milestones, plus a royalty on net sales and/or a percentage of sublicense income. The applicable royalty rate under each of the foregoing in-licensing agreements is in the low single digits. We did not incur any milestone related expenses during the three fiscal years ended April 30, 2017.
 
The following table provides certain information with respect to each of our in-licensing agreements relating to our bavituximab program.
 

Licensor | Agreement Date | Total Milestone Obligations Expensed To Date | | Potential Future Milestone Obligations (1) | 
----------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------+--
UTSWMC | August 2001 | $ | 173,000 | | $ | 300,000 | 
UTSWMC | August 2005 | | 85,000 | | | 375,000 | 
Lonza | March 2005 | | 64,000 | | | – | (2)
Avanir | December 2003 | | 100,000 | | | 1,000,000 | 
Genentech | November 2003 | | 500,000 | | | 5,000,000 | 
Total | | $ | 922,000 | | $ | 6,675,000 | 

 ______________
 
(1) | Under our current agreements, potential future milestone obligations are due upon achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Based on the current stage of clinical development for bavituximab, future milestone obligations would be due upon submission of a biologics license application in the U.S. and upon FDA approval, which events are currently uncertain and depend on positive clinical trial results. In addition, potential future milestone obligations vary by license agreement (as defined in each license agreement) and certain agreements depend on a valid patent claim, as defined in each of these underlying agreements, at the time the potential milestone is achieved.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | In the event we utilize a third-party contract manufacturer other than Lonza to manufacture bavituximab for commercial purposes, we would owe Lonza 300,000 pounds sterling per year.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not expect to incur any milestone related expenses regarding our bavituximab program during fiscal year 2018. In addition, of the total potential future milestone obligations of $6,675,000, up to $6,400,000 would be due upon the first commercial approval of bavituximab pursuant to these in-licensing agreements. However, given the uncertainty of the drug development and the regulatory approval process, we are unable to predict with any certainty when any of these future milestones will occur, if at all.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the production of our products under development. Our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the U.S., including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, as well as to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws, and similar laws outside the U.S., govern the clinical and non-clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion of our products, if approved. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including regulatory delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country.
 
The regulatory process, which includes extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate to study its safety and efficacy, is uncertain, takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.

The activities required before a product, such as bavituximab, may be marketed in the U.S. are generally performed in the following sequential steps:
 

1. | Preclinical testing. This generally includes evaluation of our products in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy. Some preclinical studies must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practice.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application. The results of preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before the clinical trials can begin. Once a new IND application is filed, the FDA has 30 days to review the IND application. The IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after the FDA receives the application, unless the FDA indicates prior to the end of the 30-day period that the application raises concerns that must be resolved to the FDA’s satisfaction before clinical trials may proceed. If the FDA raises concerns at any time, we may be unable to resolve the issues in a timely fashion, if at all.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Completion of clinical trials. Human clinical trials are necessary to seek approval for a new drug or biologic and typically involve a three-phase process. In Phase I, small clinical trials are generally conducted to determine the safety of the product. In Phase II, clinical trials are generally conducted to assess safety and acceptable dose and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the product. In Phase III, clinical trials are generally conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid proof of safety and efficacy. A clinical trial must be conducted according to good clinical practices under protocols that detail the trial’s objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. Each protocol involving U.S. trial sites must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. The FDA may impose a clinical hold on an ongoing clinical trial if, for example, safety concerns arise, in which case the study cannot recommence without FDA authorization under terms sanctioned by the FDA. Similarly, trials conducted outside the U.S. require notification and/or approval by the governing health authority. In addition, before a clinical trial can be initiated, each clinical site or hospital administering the product must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee (“IEC”). The IRB/IEC will consider, among other things, ethical factors and the safety of human subjects. The IRB/IEC may require changes in a protocol, which may delay initiation or completion of a study. Phase I, Phase II or Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our potential products. Furthermore, we, the governing health authority (including the FDA) or an IRB/IEC may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”). After completion of clinical studies for an investigational product, a BLA or NDA is submitted to the FDA for product marketing approval. No action can be taken to market any new drug or biologic product in the U.S. until the FDA has approved an appropriate marketing application.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA before the product is commercially sold or shipped. The results of preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA for approval to manufacture, market and ship the product for commercial use. The FDA may take a number of actions after the BLA or NDA is filed, including but not limited to, denying the BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, requiring additional clinical testing or information, or requiring post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us.

In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste.
 
Our product candidates, if approved, may also be subject to import laws in other countries, the food and drug laws in various states in which the products are or may be sold and subject to the export laws of agencies of the U.S. government.
 
In addition, we must also adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
We manufacture cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers and to supply our clinical trials through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a sole source supplier. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving raw materials to support the manufacturing of these cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products. However, to date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials.
Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We continue to seek patents on inventions originating from our ongoing research and development activities and in collaboration with other companies and university researchers. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we typically file patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan and additional countries on a selective basis. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions relating in general to cancer therapy and anti-viral therapy and in particular to different proteins, peptides, antibodies and conjugates, methods and devices for labeling antibodies, and therapeutic and diagnostic uses of the peptides, antibodies and conjugates. We intend to pursue opportunities to license these technologies and any advancements or enhancements, as well as to pursue the incorporation of our technologies in the development of our own products.
 
Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing and/or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. In the U.S., patents issued on applications filed prior to June 8, 1995 have a term of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, whichever is longer. U.S. patents issued on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, have a term first calculated as 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, not counting any provisional application filing date. Certain U.S. patents issued on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, and particularly on applications filed on or after May 29, 2000, are eligible for Patent Term Adjustment, which extends the term of the patent to compensate for delays in examination at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The term of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but is typically 20 years from the effective filing date, which is often the filing date of an application under the provisions of the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
 
In addition, in certain cases, the term of U.S. and foreign patents can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of health authority regulatory review. As such, certain U.S. patents may be eligible for Patent Term Extension under 35 U.S.C. § 156 (known as “the Hatch-Waxman Act”) to restore the portion of the patent term that has been lost as a result of review at the U.S. FDA. Such extensions, which may be up to a maximum of five years (but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years), are potentially available to one U.S. patent that claims an approved human drug product (including a human biological product), a method of using a drug product, a method of manufacturing a drug product, or a medical device.

We consider that in the aggregate our patents, patent applications and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations. Of the patent portfolios that are owned, controlled by or exclusively licensed to us, those concerning our PS-targeting technology platform, including bavituximab are of particular importance to our operations and our clinical pipeline.
 
Our patent portfolios relating to the PS-targeting technology platform in oncology include U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with claims directed to methods, compositions and combinations for targeting tumor vasculature and imaging and treating cancer using antibodies and conjugates that localize to the aminophospholipids, PS (Phosphatidylserine) and PE (Phosphatidylethanolamine), exposed on tumor vascular endothelial cells. These patents are currently set to expire between 2019 and 2021.
 
Our patent portfolios relating to the PS-targeting technology platform in the viral field include U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with claims directed to methods, compositions and combinations for inhibiting viral replication or spread and for treating viral infections and diseases using antibodies, certain peptides and conjugates that localize to the aminophospholipids, PS and PE, exposed on viruses and virally-infected cells. Such anti-viral patents concerning antibodies and conjugates are currently set to expire in 2023.
 
Additionally, we have U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating more specifically to our product, bavituximab, including composition of matter, combinations and methods of use in treating angiogenesis and cancer and in treating viral infections and diseases, alone and in combination therapies. These patents that more specifically concern bavituximab compositions and their use in treating cancer, both alone and in combination therapies, are currently set to expire between 2023 and 2025.
 
The information given above is based on our current understanding of the patents and patent applications that we own, control, or have exclusively licensed. The information is subject to revision, for example, in the event of changes in the law or legal rulings affecting our patents, or if we become aware of new information. In particular, the expiry information given above does not account for possible extension of any U.S. or foreign patent to recapture patent term effectively lost as a result of FDA or other health authority regulatory review. We intend to seek such extensions, as appropriate to approved product(s), which may be up to a maximum of five years (but not extending the term of a patent beyond 14 years).
 
The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others. In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties that we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use or sale of our products. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) generally require us to pay royalties to the parties.
 
We also own trademarks to protect the names of our products and services. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.
 
With respect to our contract manufacturing business, we have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise (“know-how”) and trade secrets in the provision of process development and manufacturing services. Our know-how and trade secrets may not be patentable, but they are valuable in that they enhance our ability to provide high-quality services to our customers. We also intend to continue to rely upon trade secrets and improvements, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position in research and development of our therapeutic and diagnostic products. We typically place restrictions in our agreements with third-parties, which contractually restrict their right to use and disclose any of our proprietary technology with which they may be involved. In addition, we have internal non-disclosure safeguards, including confidentiality agreements, with our employees.

Segment Information
 
Our business is organized into two reportable operating segments. Peregrine is engaged in the research and development of monoclonal antibodies focused on the treatment of cancer and has not generated any product sales from any of its technologies under development. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid, is engaged in providing fully-integrated cGMP biomanufacturing services for us and its third-party customers. In addition, we had no foreign based operations and no long-lived assets located in foreign countries as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Note 10, “Segment Reporting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our operating segments.
Customers
 
Contract manufacturing revenue has historically been derived from a small customer base. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, approximately 98% of contract manufacturing revenue was generated from three customers. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 95% and 91%, respectively, of contract manufacturing revenue was generated from two customers. In addition, typically we have not entered into long-term commitments with these third-party customers because their need for product supply depends on a variety of factors, including the products stage of development, the timing of regulatory filings and approvals, the product needs of their collaborators, if applicable, their financial resources and the market demand with respect to commercial products. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from any one of our primary customers is significantly reduced or eliminated. Refer to Note 10, “Segment Reporting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding Avid’s customer concentration and geographic areas of its customers.
Competition
 
The CDMO and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Our competition in the CDMO market includes full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Also, large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry includes several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in research and development of immunotherapy-based products that have commenced clinical trials with, or have successfully commercialized, these products. Some or all of these companies may have greater financial resources, larger technical staffs and larger research budgets than we have, as well as greater experience in developing products and running clinical trials.
 
With respect to our lead immunotherapy candidate, bavituximab, we are not aware of any other company developing an investigational product similar to bavituximab, however, before we can more clearly define our competition, we will need to generate additional clinical data from our current or potential future planned trials.
 
Research and Development
 
The majority of our operating expenses to date have been related to research and development. Research and development expenses primarily include (i) payroll and related costs, including share-based compensation, associated with research and development personnel, (ii) costs related to clinical trials and preclinical testing of our technologies under development, (iii) costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility related expenses, (iv) expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories, including sponsored research funding, and (v) other research and development expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses. Research and development expenses were $28,297,000 in fiscal year 2017, $59,529,000 in fiscal year 2016, and $42,996,000 in fiscal year 2015.
Human Resources
 
As of April 30, 2017, we employed 319 full-time employees and four part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
