ITEM 1.      Business
General
Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. is a holding company, incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1981, that conducts business through its subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” include Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Founded in 1937, we are one of the oldest mutual fund complexes in the United States, having introduced the former Waddell & Reed Advisors group of mutual funds (the “Advisors Funds”) in 1940. Over time we’ve added additional mutual funds: Ivy Funds (the “Ivy Funds”); Ivy Variable Insurance Portfolios, our variable product offering (“Ivy VIP”); InvestEd Portfolios, our 529 college savings plan (“InvestEd”); Ivy High Income Opportunities Fund, a closed-end mutual fund (“IVH”); the Ivy Global Investors Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable (the “SICAV”) and its Ivy Global Investors sub-funds (the “IGI Funds”), an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities; (collectively, the Advisors Funds, Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP, InvestEd and IVH are referred to as the “Funds”). In 2018, we completed the merger of all Advisors Funds into Ivy Funds with substantially similar objectives and strategies, and substantially completed the liquidation of the IGI Funds. In addition to the Funds and IGI Funds, our assets under management (“AUM”) include institutional accounts managed by the Company.
We derive our revenues from providing investment management and advisory services, investment product underwriting and distribution, and shareholder services administration to the Funds, institutional accounts, and the IGI Funds prior to their liquidation. We also provide wealth management services, primarily to retail clients through Waddell & Reed, Inc. (“W&R”), and independent financial advisors associated with W&R (“Advisors”), who provide financial planning and advice to their clients. Investment management and advisory fees and certain underwriting and distribution revenues are based on the level of AUM and assets under administration (“AUA”) and are affected by sales levels, financial market conditions, redemptions and the composition of assets. Our underwriting and distribution revenues consist of fees earned on fee-based advisory programs, asset-based service and distribution fees promulgated under the 1940 Act (“Rule 12b-1”), distribution fees on certain variable products, and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products. The products sold have various commission structures and the revenues received from those sales vary based on the type and dollar amount sold. Shareholder service fee revenue includes transfer agency fees, custodian fees from retirement plan accounts, portfolio accounting and administration fees, and is earned based on client AUM or number of client accounts. Our major expenses are for distribution of our products, compensation related costs, occupancy, general & administrative, and information technology.
Proposed Acquisition of Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. by Macquarie

On December 2, 2020, the Company announced a merger agreement with Macquarie Asset Management, the asset management division of Macquarie Group. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Macquarie Management Holdings, Inc. (“Macquarie”), Merry Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) and (solely for limited purposes) Macquarie Financial Holdings Pty Ltd, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”), with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of the Company’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law in accordance with the Merger Agreement. On completion of the merger, Macquarie intends to sell our wealth management business to LPL Holdings, Inc.

The proposed merger is expected to close by the end of April 2021, subject to regulatory approvals, Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.
​
Please see the Risks Related to the Proposed Merger included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a discussion of certain risks related to our proposed merger with Macquarie. Please see the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 17, 2021, for additional information on the merger.

Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
​
The Company continues to proactively manage business continuity and safety considerations as circumstances of

COVID-19 evolve. Our leadership team’s priority is on ensuring the health and safety of all employees, clients, Advisors and communities, while also ensuring full continuity of service and access. The Company started transitioning to a work from home environment early in March 2020 and has been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local authorities’ recommendations on safe practices throughout this process. We have undertaken a number of steps to facilitate safety, security and full continuity of service, including:

● | Our Enterprise Preparedness Team and COVID-19 steering committee continue to meet regularly to assess developments and determine the best action to ensure business continuity and the safety of our employees and partners.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have adopted interim business practices, including restricting business travel, requiring meetings to take place via remote access tools, adopting safety protocols to limit the potential for exposure, adopting social distancing practices, implementing a clearly-defined approval process for reentry to any worksite, advising personnel on preventive measures and offering remote collaboration and productivity tools and training resources to our employees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We enhanced monitoring and capabilities of our systems to allow our remote workforce to function efficiently and have continued our educational and monitoring practices to ensure there are no compromises to confidentiality, privacy and cybersecurity requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Ivy investment management and distribution teams transitioned seamlessly to remote working. Our teams have a strong heritage of active collaboration which has migrated to a virtual environment without compromise. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Within our wealth management business, approximately 25% of Advisors are working from temporary locations. We are demonstrating our differentiated service and support model by continuing regular communications with Advisors as well as delivering additional advisor and client focused resources. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We have not initiated any layoffs, furloughs or reduced hours. As we implemented our business continuity plans, we have intentionally maintained the same pay practices for all of our employees based upon their regular work schedule, paid spot bonuses to certain employees, implemented a temporary hourly wage increase to designated client services personnel, increased certain benefit coverages for specific COVID-19 related treatments and made targeted philanthropic contributions to local organizations to help support the COVID-19 responses in our community.

​
Organization
We deliver our investment management advisory services through our subsidiary, Ivy Investment Management Company (“IICO”), the registered investment adviser for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP and InvestEd. 

Our underwriting and distribution services are delivered through our two broker-dealers: W&R and Ivy Distributors, Inc. (“IDI”). W&R is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser that acts as a distributor of variable annuities and other insurance products issued by our business partners. IDI is the distributor and underwriter for the Ivy Funds, Ivy VIP and InvestEd.
Waddell & Reed Services Company (“WRSCO”) and/or its subagents provide transfer agency and accounting services to the Funds.
Investment Management Operations
Our investment management and advisory services provide one of our largest sources of revenues. We earn investment management fee revenues by providing investment management and advisory services pursuant to investment management agreements with the Funds. While the specific terms of the agreements vary, the basic terms are similar. The agreements provide that we render overall investment management services to each of the Funds, subject to the oversight of each Fund’s board of trustees and in accordance with each Fund’s investment objectives and policies. The agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for shareholder services or accounting services with each respective Fund.

5




Each Fund’s board of trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund or the Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “ICA”) (“disinterested members”) and the Fund’s shareholders must approve the investment management agreement between the respective Fund and the Company. These agreements may continue in effect from year to year if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Fund’s board, including a majority of the disinterested members, or (ii) the vote of a majority of both the shareholders of the Fund and the disinterested members of each Fund’s board, each vote being cast in person at a meeting called for such purpose. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined by the ICA or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and may be terminated without penalty by any Fund by giving us 60 days’ written notice if the termination has been approved by a majority of the Fund’s trustees or the Fund’s shareholders. We may terminate an investment management agreement without penalty on 120 days’ written notice. Our proposed merger with Macquarie constitutes an assignment under the ICA and the Advisers Act. Each Fund’s board of trustees and the Fund’s shareholders must approve any assignment of an investment management agreement. We are in the process of obtaining the consents required for the assignment of investment management agreements resulting from the consummation of the merger.
In addition to performing investment management services for the Funds, we act as an investment adviser for institutional and other private investors and we provide subadvisory services to other investment companies. Such services are provided pursuant to various written agreements, and our fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM.
Our investment management team begins each business day in a collaborative discussion that fosters the sharing of information, analysis and ideas, yet reinforces individual accountability. Through all market cycles, we remain dedicated to the following investment principles:

● | Rigorous fundamental research—an enduring investment culture that dedicates itself to analyzing companies on our own rather than relying exclusively on widely available research produced by others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collaboration and accountability—a balance of collaboration and individual accountability, which ensures the sharing and analysis of investment ideas among investment professionals while empowering portfolio managers to shape their portfolios individually.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus on growing and protecting client assets—a sound approach that seeks to capture asset appreciation when market conditions are favorable and strives to manage risk during difficult market periods.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These three principles shape our investment philosophy and money management approach. For over 80 years, our investment organization has delivered consistently competitive investment performance. Through bull and bear markets, our investment professionals have not strayed from what works—fundamental research and a time-tested investment processes. We believe long-term clients turn to us because they appreciate that our investment approach continues to identify and create opportunities for wealth creation.
A key part of our investment culture is our commitment to long-term, sustainable business models. Environmental considerations, social matters including diversity, inclusion, employee engagement and community investments, leadership and governance, business impact and innovation are just some of the dimensions we have incorporated into our fundamental investment process. Collectively, these environmental, social and governance matters include issues known as “ESG”. In furthering our commitment to sustainable investing, we are a member of the Investor Advisory Group of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Alliance and an investor signatory to both the CDP and the Investor Stewardship Group.
We believe that great investors thrive in an investor-focused, stewardship culture, which we explicitly state in our Code of Ethics. Acting with a partnership mindset extends investment time horizons, and deepens client relationships, in a way that supports strong and sustainable investment performance. As such, our portfolio management group has meaningful personal assets invested alongside client funds at Ivy. Our investment management team is comprised of 91 professionals, including 32 portfolio managers who average 25 years of industry experience and 18 years of tenure with our firm. We have significant experience in virtually all major asset classes, several specialized asset classes and a range of investment styles. We have emphasized a culture and practice of team-based portfolio management on our funds and have fortified our research team with additional investment analysts over the past several years, while continuing to foster a collaborative culture across our investment management professionals. We also engage subadvisors who bring additional expertise in specific asset classes, when appropriate.

Investment Management Products
Our mutual funds provide a wide variety of investment options. We are the exclusive underwriter and distributor of 84 registered mutual fund portfolios in the Funds, which includes 48 investment strategies. During 2018, the remaining Advisors Funds merged into Ivy Funds with substantially similar objectives and strategies and six Ivy Funds and one Ivy VIP fund merged into Ivy Funds and an Ivy VIP fund, respectively, with generally similar investment objectives. Variable products, Ivy VIP and InvestEd are offered primarily through Advisors in our wealth management channel; in some circumstances, certain of those funds are also offered through the unaffiliated channel. The Ivy Funds are offered through both our unaffiliated channel and wealth management channel. The Funds’ AUM are included in either our unaffiliated channel or our wealth management channel depending on which channel marketed the client account or is the broker of record. We also offer our strategies in other structures, such as institutional separate accounts, collective investment trusts and model-delivery separately managed accounts. As of December 31, 2020, we managed $74.8 billion in AUM.
Distribution Channels
One of our distinctive qualities is that we distribute our investment products through a balanced distribution network. Our distribution channels cover retail sales channels, including our affiliated wealth manager, W&R, as well as an institutional sales channel.
Unaffiliated Channel
The IDI focused distribution model centers on two sales channels, National Distribution and Professional Buyers Distribution, to best diversify asset flow and the AUM profile of the Company. AUM in this channel were $28.0 billion at the end of 2020.
National Distribution, inclusive of National Accounts and National Wholesale, drives sales throughout the nationwide broker-dealer network. The National Accounts team focuses on firm home office interactions and the National Wholesale team focuses on driving sales at the financial advisor level. This alignment provides a holistic, cohesive and collaborative sales and service approach to our national broker-dealer partners. National Wholesale includes 23 external wholesalers, four of which are exclusively devoted to W&R.
Professional Buyers Distribution focuses on sales and service across the institutional, consultant relations, insurance, registered investment advisor (“RIA”) and defined contribution investment only (“DCIO”) categories. Unifying sales strategies within the Professional Buyers Distribution group brings collaboration, shared knowledge and enhanced service levels to key institutional, retirement, insurance and RIA clients that require specialized interactions and communication.
The Distribution Operations team supports IDI’s sales and service-related processes including training, business intelligence, client relationship management and sales systems, and practice management. This group also includes IDI’s professional client experience team, which creates key client-facing deliverables utilized by both distribution groups. The Distribution Operations team is designed to help increase the overall knowledge and responsiveness of the entire distribution channel.
Wealth Management Channel
Throughout our history and continuing today, Advisors sell investment products to individuals, families and businesses across the country in geographic markets of all sizes. Advisors assist clients on a wide range of financial issues with a significant focus on helping them plan, generally, for long-term goals and offer one-on-one consultations that emphasize long-term relationships through continued service. 
Over the past several years, we have expanded our wealth management platform technology and product offering, while continuing to make investments that allow Advisors to simplify the way they conduct business with clients. We continue to work to transform W&R into a fully competitive and profitable aspect of our business model. These efforts have included enhancing the compensation program for Advisors, investing in a new advisor technology platform, transitioning advisors currently leasing space in W&R offices to personal branch offices and redesigning the Advisor service and support model. These additional enhancements were designed to increase our ability to retain and competitively

recruit experienced Advisors. Since January 1, 2020, 51 new advisors have affiliated with W&R with combined prior firm AUA totaling over $2.8 billion.
As of December 31, 2020, there were 936 Advisors and 397 licensed advisor associates, for a total of 1,333 licensed individuals associated with W&R who operate out of offices located throughout the United States. Based on industry data, W&R ranks among the largest independent wealth management firms. As of December 31, 2020, our wealth management channel had AUM of $43.3 billion. 
Institutional Channel
We also manage assets in a variety of investment styles for a variety of types of institutions. The largest client type is other asset managers that hire us to act as subadvisor for their branded products; they are typically domestic distributors of investment products who lack scale or the track record to manage internally or choose to market multi-manager styles. Our diverse client list also includes pension funds, Taft-Hartley plans and endowments. AUM in the institutional channel were $3.6 billion at December 31, 2020.Wealth Management Products and Services
Since our founding in 1937, W&R has been committed to our client’s financial goals. W&R offers a variety of sophisticated and personalized financial planning services to address virtually any client goal, objective or situation including retirement planning, education planning, survivor needs, asset allocation, estate planning, business planning, income tax planning, disability and long-term care. W&R offers a variety of products to clients including fee-based advisory products, mutual funds, general securities, 529 college savings plans, retirement plans and insurance and annuities. In 2020, W&R expanded its WaddellONE centralized digital platform with the launch of ONESource, a consolidated digital repository, which seamlessly connects data across platforms for advisors, and ONEService, a web-based repository of processes, procedures and other information available to all Advisors. 

W&R offers clients full-service brokerage services as well as a variety of fee-based advisory programs, including Managed Allocation Portfolio (“MAP”), MAPChoice, MAPFlex, MAPSelect, MAPLatitude, MAPNavigator, MAPDirect, Guided Investment Strategies and Strategic Portfolio Allocation (“SPA”). These programs utilize a variety of underlying investment options including mutual funds, individual stocks and bonds and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and are part of the evolution of our fully independent wealth management business model. In 2020, W&R introduced a High Net Worth suite of products and services enabling affiliated advisors to offer a holistic, flexible approach to complex financial situations, as well as a new Separately Managed Account (“SMA”) Strategies product offering allowing affiliated advisors to offer the direct ownership structure, transparency, tax strategy options and other benefits of SMAs to clients. As of December 31, 2020, clients had $33.1 billion invested in our fee-based advisory programs.
​
Through W&R, we distribute various variable annuity products, some of which offer our affiliated Ivy VIP funds as an investment vehicle. Through our insurance agency subsidiaries, Advisors also offer clients retirement and life insurance products underwritten by our business partners. We offer unaffiliated mutual fund products, other variable annuity products, and full-service brokerage products and services through a third-party clearing broker-dealer. 
AUA includes both client assets invested in the Funds and in other companies’ products that are distributed through W&R and held in brokerage accounts or within our fee-based advisory programs. As of December 31, 2020, we managed AUA of $69.7 billion.
Service Agreements
We earn service fee revenues by providing various services to the Funds and their shareholders. Pursuant to shareholder servicing agreements, we perform shareholder servicing functions for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining shareholder accounts; issuing, transferring and redeeming shares; distributing dividends and paying redemptions; furnishing information related to the Funds; and handling shareholder inquiries. During 2019, the Company outsourced the transactional processing operations of its internal transfer agency, which provides some of these services. Pursuant to accounting service agreements, we provide the Funds with accounting and administrative services and assistance for which the Funds pay us a monthly fee, including: maintaining the Funds’ records; pricing Fund shares; and preparing prospectuses for existing shareholders, proxy statements and certain other shareholder reports. Agreements with

the Funds may be adopted or amended with the approval of the disinterested members of each Fund’s board of trustees and have annually renewable terms.
Competition
The financial services industry is a highly competitive global industry. According to the Investment Company Institute (the “ICI”), at the end of 2020, there were more than 9,000 open-end investment companies, nearly 500 closed-end investment companies and more than 2,100 exchange traded funds of varying sizes, investment policies and objectives whose shares are being offered to the public in the United States alone. Factors affecting our business include investment performance, fees, brand recognition, business reputation, quality of service and the continuity of both client relationships and AUM. A majority of mutual fund sales go to funds that are highly rated by a small number of well-known ranking services that focus on investment performance. Competition is influenced by the achievement of competitive investment management performance, distribution methods, the type and quality of shareholder services, the success of marketing efforts and the ability to develop investment products for certain market segments to meet the changing needs of investors.
We compete with other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute their fund shares through a variety of methods, including affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public of shares offered at a low or no sales charge. Many larger mutual fund complexes have significant advertising budgets and established relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks, which enable these fund complexes to reach broad client bases. In recent years, there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in competitors with greater financial resources than us. Many investment management firms and unaffiliated advisors offer services and products similar to ours. We also compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions and businesses offering other financial products in all aspects of their businesses. 
The distribution of mutual funds and other investment products has experienced significant evolution and change in recent years, which have intensified the competitive environment. Changes include the introduction of new products, the rationalization of the number of products offered on third party platforms, increasingly complex distribution systems with multiple classes of shares, the development of investors’ ability to invest online and through mobile applications, the introduction of sophisticated technological platforms used by financial advisors to sell and service mutual funds for their clients, the introduction of separately managed accounts—previously available only to institutional investors—to individuals, and growth in the number of products offered. In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive investment strategies, which have taken market share from active managers like ourselves. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for active management.
We believe we effectively compete across multiple dimensions of the asset management and wealth management businesses. First, we market our products, primarily the Ivy Funds family, to unaffiliated broker-dealers and advisors and compete against other asset managers offering mutual fund products. Competition is impacted by sales techniques, personal relationships and skills, and the quality of financial planning products and services offered. We compete against a broad range of asset managers and wealth managers that are both larger and smaller than our firm, but we believe that the breadth and depth of our products position us to compete in this environment. Second, we believe our business model targets clients seeking personal assistance from financial advisors or planners. The market for financial advice is extremely broad and fragmented. Advisors compete with large and small broker-dealers, unaffiliated advisors, registered investment advisers, financial institutions, insurance representatives and others. Finally, we compete in the institutional marketplace, working with consultants who select asset managers for various opportunities, as well as working directly with plan sponsors, foundations, endowments, sovereign funds and other asset managers who hire subadvisors. 
We also face competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees and Advisors. To maximize our ability to compete effectively in our business, we offer competitive compensation. We are advancing our culture by focusing on our core values and further investing in our people through areas such as talent management, employee experience, diversity and inclusion and total rewards. For Advisors, we enhanced our compensation program and continue to build on our value proposition through enhancements to technology, products and a leading service model. We also boosted our recruiting efforts nationally and have a national recruiting team in place whose focus is to attract, build relationships with and, ultimately, add experienced financial advisors to W&R’s national network.

For additional discussion regarding the impact of competition, please see the Market and Competition risk factors included in Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Regulation
The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors, including our clients and customers and the shareholders of the registered investment companies to which we provide services, and contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. Under these laws and regulations, agencies and organizations that regulate various of our subsidiaries in their capacity as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and transfer agents have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser, broker-dealer or transfer agent from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include, but are not limited to, the suspension of individual employees or agents, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of registrations. 
The SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws and the regulation and oversight of investment advisers, broker-dealers, and transfer agents.
Two of our subsidiaries, W&R and IICO, are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, which imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including, among other things, fiduciary duties, record keeping and reporting requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. Investment advisers are subject to examination by the SEC, and the SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.
Two of our subsidiaries, W&R and IDI, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and each state and U.S. territory in which they conduct business. The SEC’s rules impose numerous obligations on registered broker-dealers, including, among other things capital, record-keeping, and reporting requirements, operational requirements and financial and other disclosure requirements, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. In particular, the SEC’s broker-dealer net capital requirements are designed to ensure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers and prohibit continued operation by a broker-dealer that fall below minimum net capital requirements. The maintenance of minimum net capital requirements may also limit our ability to pay dividends. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, net capital for W&R and IDI exceeded all minimum requirements. In addition, both W&R and IDI are members of, and subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), which regulates most aspects of the business conducted by broker-dealers while also exercising examination, oversight and enforcement powers. W&R and IDI are also members of various other self-regulatory organizations that regulate and oversee more limited aspects of these subsidiaries’ business. These other self-regulatory organizations include the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which regulates activity related to municipal securities and the securities exchanges, which regulate and oversee exchange related activities. Collectively, regulations by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, and the states and U.S. territories cover all aspects of a broker-dealer’s securities business, including, in addition to those already listed above, sales practices, market making and trading, the use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, and the conduct of directors, officers, employees and associated persons. Broker-dealers are subject to examination by the SEC, FINRA and applicable states and territories, each of which is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of applicable laws and rules. Sanctions can include revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm, its officers or employees. In addition to being registered as a broker-dealer, W&R is dually-registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations, including Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS, that became effective in June 2020, and were intended to enhance the quality and transparency of retail investors’ relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. Regulation Best Interest enhanced the broker-dealer conduct standard towards retail investors beyond existing suitability obligations and requires compliance with disclosure, care, conflict of interest and compliance obligations. Form CRS requires broker-dealers and registered investment advisers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, including (i) the types of client and customer relationships and services the firm offers, (ii) the fees, costs, conflicts of interest and required standard of conduct associated with those relationships and services, (iii) whether the firm and its financial professionals currently have reportable legal or disciplinary history; and (iv) how to obtain additional information about the firm. In addition, certain states have enacted 

10




or proposed fiduciary and best interest standards for broker-dealers.
The Funds are registered as investment companies with the SEC under the ICA, and various filings are made with states under applicable state rules and regulations. The ICA regulates the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser and prohibits or severely restricts principal transactions and joint transactions. Various regulations cover certain investment strategies that may be used by the Funds for hedging and/or speculative purposes. To the extent the Funds purchase futures contracts, options on futures contracts, swaps and foreign currency contracts above certain de minimis thresholds established by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), they are subject to the commodities and futures regulations of the CFTC. Pursuant to the mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law in July 2010, the CFTC and the SEC have promulgated rules that increase the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets. The CFTC has adopted certain amendments to its rules that would limit the ability of mutual funds and certain other products we sponsor to use commodities, futures, swaps, and other derivatives without additional registration. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the CFTC’s authority to limit the maximum long or short position that any person may take in futures contracts, options on futures contracts and certain swaps.
As a publicly-traded company, the Company is also subject to federal and state laws affecting corporate governance, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC. Our report on internal controls over financial reporting for 2020 is included in Part I, Item 9A. As a publicly traded company that is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), we are also subject to certain rules of the NYSE, including the NYSE’s corporate governance listing standards, as approved by the SEC.
Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, imposes significant anti money laundering requirements on most financial institutions, including domestic banks and domestic operations of foreign banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants and investment companies.
The Company and Advisors in our wealth management channel are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the extent they are considered “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain clients. In April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) adopted regulations that, among other things, treated as fiduciaries any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to employee benefit plans, plan fiduciaries, plan participants, plan beneficiaries, IRAs or IRA owners (the “DOL Fiduciary Rule”). Although the DOL Fiduciary Rule was vacated, we already had implemented a number of business and compliance initiatives in order to change our distribution methods and operations in response to the DOL Fiduciary Rule. The DOL is expected to promulgate in the future a rule to replace the DOL Fiduciary Rule that could impose materially different requirements on the Company and make such changes implemented in response to the DOL Fiduciary Rule unnecessary or no longer appropriate. Such a rule could also impose additional or different requirements on the Company than the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest and standards adopted by one or more states. 
Our businesses may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to investment advisers, broker-dealers or transfer agents, but also by laws and regulations of general application. For example, the volume of our principal investment advisory business in a given time period could be affected by, among other things, existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies (including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board), and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities.
Our business is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations, including those set forth below. For additional discussion regarding the impact of current and proposed legal or regulatory requirements, please see the Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks included in Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also established enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (“FSOC”). Under a final rule and interpretive guidance issued by the FSOC, certain non-bank financial companies have been designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions (“SIFIs”). At this time, regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as SIFIs. However, if any of the Funds or our affiliates is deemed a SIFI, we would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, 

11




supervisory and other requirements. 
The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to modify the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. In late 2016, the SEC adopted new rules that require registered open-end funds to adopt liquidity risk management programs with specific requirements for measuring and reporting the liquidity of fund holdings, including the requirement to bucket every portfolio holding within one of four prescribed liquidity buckets. The SEC has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in trading practices, cybersecurity and the evaluation of systemic risks and has indicated an intention to propose new rules for transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets. In 2019, the SEC re-proposed a rule regulating the use of derivatives by registered investment companies on its regulatory agenda. Among other requirements, the rule, as proposed, would require our Funds to adopt a derivatives risk management program unless they qualify for certain exceptions and would limit the degree to which our Funds may invest in derivatives based on certain “value at risk” metrics.

Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we had 1,116 full-time employees, consisting of 1,053 home office employees and 63 employees responsible for field supervision and administration. Women represented 44 percent of our workforce while those ethnically diverse represented 16 percent.
As an organization, we have taken specific action to advance our position as a values-based and purpose-driven organization and believe that supporting an environment that welcomes diverse thoughts, perspectives and experiences fosters stronger organizational growth. We are constantly challenging ourselves to ensure that our workforce is a reflection of our values and the communities we serve. To that end, we have engaged dedicated diversity and inclusion resources, and taken steps to enhance and continue to welcome diversity in all forms in our organization. Our CEO has signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ pledge, acknowledging that the Company will act to cultivate trust, diversity, flexibility and understanding. In addition, our employees were invited to sign the I ACT ON pledge to check bias, speak up for others and show up for all. We also offer our employees ongoing opportunities for education and training exploring bias and inclusion, designed to create conversations around the impact of natural biases and how the organization can continue to foster an environment of belonging and an inclusive workplace.
Our Culture Connections initiative is our version of employee resource groups, which are focused around five important pillars of our culture: Diversity & Inclusion, Employee Appreciation, Philanthropy, Strategy & Values, and Well-being. These employee groups represent a variety of roles, levels and diverse backgrounds and provide opportunities for all employees to elevate the employee experience and strengthen our culture. 
We are partnering with organizations like Rock The Street Wall Street to encourage young females to consider careers in financial services. We started a partnership with the Forte Foundation, a non-profit organization connecting female MBA students and recent graduates with job opportunities in the financial services industry. In addition, we became a sponsor of Kansas City Women in Technology, a non-profit organization whose vision is to grow the number of women in technology careers within Kansas City. We launched a new employee mentoring program that enabled all employees to either connect with a mentor or act as a mentor to colleagues. The goal of our mentoring program is to actively support employees as they pursue personal and professional goals, which we believe leads to higher levels of engagement and retention. 
Our work in fostering a culture of belonging was recognized in 2020 as Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. was named a finalist for the Diversity Champions award by InvestmentNews. We, along with other firms, were chosen from over 120 nominations for the firm’s ability to inspire others from diverse backgrounds to join, flourish and bring their authentic selves to work in the financial services industry.
