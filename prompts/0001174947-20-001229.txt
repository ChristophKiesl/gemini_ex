ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General 
 
The Holding Company was incorporated in New York in July 2013 to serve as a holding company for the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (the “Appliance Company”), Pike County Light & Power Company (“Pike”), Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC (“Leatherstocking Gas”), and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC (“Leatherstocking Pipeline”). The Holding Company also owns 50% of Leatherstocking Gas of New York, Inc. “Leatherstocking NY”. As used in this document, the term “the Company” refers to the consolidated operations of the Holding Company, Gas Company, Pike and (from July 1, 2020) the Leatherstocking Companies.
 
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 330 W. William Street, Corning New York, 14830, the telephone number is (607) 936-3755, and our website is www.corninggas.com.
 
Business 
 
The Company’s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas, Pike and the Leatherstocking Companies, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas serves approximately 15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York, areas. It is franchised to supply gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the New York Public Service Commission (“NYPSC”) which oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies. In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility, to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“PAPUC”). Pike provides electric service to approximately 4,800 customers in the Townships of Westfall, Milford and the northern part of Dingman and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike provides natural gas service to 1,200 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All of these communities are located in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, Leatherstocking Gas is also regulated by the PAPUC and distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated company, has served one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania and has had no revenues since 2018. Leatherstocking NY has an application pending before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services in Broome County, New York.
Gas and Electric Supply
 
Corning Gas has contracted with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately 736,000 dekatherms (“Dth”). The Company manages its transportation and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (“O&R”) to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements until August 2022, subject to renewal. Leatherstocking Gas has a supply agreement with Cabot Oil and Gas.
 
Corning Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2020-2021 winter season and is managing its storage and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing and storage, will be adequate to serve its approximately 15,000 customers.
 
Corning Gas does not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with O&R will enable Pike to meet all our electric and gas needs for Pike’s customers until August 2022, subject to renewal, and that Cabot Oil and Gas will be able to continue reliably supplying Leatherstocking Gas.

Seasonality
 
The Company’s business is seasonal in nature, and sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable. Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Gas sales peak in the winter, while Pike’s electric sales peak in the summer.
Significant Customers
 
The Gas Company has three major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric & Gas, and Bath Electric, Gas & Water Systems. In total, these customers accounted for approximately 14.32% of the Gas Company’s revenues in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (“FY 2020”) and 15.18% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (“FY 2019”). The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse impact on our financial results.
Employees
 
The Company had 72 employees as of September 30, 2020, and 64 as of September 30, 2019. Of this total, approximately one third are union labor working under a union contract effective until April 5, 2021.
Competition
 
Historically, the competition in the Gas Company’s residential market and Pike’s and Leatherstocking Gas’s gas franchise territories have been primarily from electricity for water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that of alternative fuels in our service territories and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets continues to be strong. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today. Pike electric has not faced significant competition to date. Although not material today, we could experience competition from customer owned solar in the future.
Environmental Regulation
 
We believe we are in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings, litigation or complaints.
Regulatory Matters
 
On June 15, 2017, the NYPSC issued an Order Adopting Terms of Joint Proposal and Establishing Gas Rate Plan (the “June 2017 Order” adopting the Joint Proposal without substantive modification. In February 2020, Corning Gas filed a new rate case with the NYPSC. Pike is operating under a rate order issued effective September 1, 2014, extended to March 1, 2018, and continuing until the next rate case under the terms of our acquisition (for additional information see below under the heading “Regulatory Matters – Pike”). In October 2020, Pike filed rate cases for both electric and gas operations.
