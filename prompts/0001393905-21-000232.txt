BUSINESS
 
(1) Principal products or services and their markets;
 
The Company’s technology comprises two product lines called BizjetMobile and fflya. The products deliver inflight connectivity for business aviation and commercial airlines respectively.
 
BizjetMobile provides corporate jets with an alternative global inflight connectivity solution and is marketed under the brand names CrewX, CHiiMP and BizjetInternet. They are mobile Apps which deliver a combination of highly optimized inflight text, chat, email, voice and internet for passengers and crew. The on-board network comprises an integrated satellite transceiver incorporating a Bluetooth hotspot that uses a set of algorithms and file management protocols that are custom built for aviation satellite networks. All communications are managed by a cloud-based gateway and report by user, flight, aircraft, file, and message type. As a result, passengers and crew receive unlimited inflight connectivity for a flat low monthly rate.
 
fflya provides airlines with a customized global inflight connectivity approach, based on the latest mobile App technology, narrowband satellite links and Bluetooth technology. The fflya platform reduces the installation, certification and equipment costs by up to 90% compared to inflight broadband. In addition, it uses a cloud-based messaging platform capable of delivering real-time demographic and profiling data. By incorporating embedded advertising and destination sponsors, fflya can deliver free messaging to airline passengers.

BizjetMobile and fflya leverage off the existing Inmarsat & Iridium satellites, but will be further enhanced by Next Generation Iridium satellites and Iridium Certus for aviation.
 
The Company has commissioned over 90 BizjetMobile systems since launch, operating across Asia Pacific, the America’s, Europe and the Middle East.
 
Markets
 
BizjetMobile’s target market is the business aviation industry, specifically international corporate jets searching for an alternative low-cost global inflight connectivity solution or an-add on service to reduce their operational costs.
 
fflya’s target market is primarily low cost airlines (“LCA”) operating single aisle aircraft, for example, Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, that struggle to justify equipping their fleets with expensive Wi-Fi platforms as their business model targets passengers who are unwilling to pay. Of the 18,000 commercial airliners currently in operation, the B737/A320 series account for 13,000, of which approximately 75% are operated by regional airlines and LCA’s. Single aisle aircraft represent 75% of the 35,000 new aircraft forecast to be delivered over the next 20 years.
 
(2) Distribution methods of the products or services;
 
The Company has BizjetMobile distributors which are related parties controlled by the Chapman family for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which will represent the Company on a commission basis. fflya marketing is controlled by the Chapman family in conjunction with distributors who will receive commissions from successful airline programs. The Company has also licensed PT. Jalin Angkasa Indonesia (JAI) as the exclusive marketing arm for Indonesia and Malaysia.
 
(3) Status of any publicly announced new product or service;
 
fflya - Following the official launch of the fflya airline program in 2018 at the World Aviation festival in London, the Company embarked an extensive marketing campaign to secure a launch customer. Leading up to the launch, the program had completed ground and flight testing of the Bluetooth network with a major European Airline on an A380 and B777. Further internal testing was also conducted on B787 and A340.
 
Following a further 18 months of airline discussion and presentations, the fflya program evolved to its current format. As a direct result, ASIP announced agreements with Wizzair and Citilink to trial the fflya system.
 
The fflya hardware, apps, gateway and support system are developed and supplied by a related party, ASiQ Pty Ltd (ASiQ), under the IP acquisition agreement and comprises, a router that connects passengers via Bluetooth, and a revolutionary window antenna system that connects to the Iridium satellite network. ASIP contracts the service and hardware under commercial terms on a program by program basis.
 
The systems proprietary software app facilitates free passenger messaging, profiled and embedded with sponsors and links. It can be embedded into an airline’s existing booking App, which can create an instant database of millions of potential users when the airline app is updated, in addition to the ability to brand each service or icon. Every text message can include an embedded sponsor i.e. delivered by XXXX or branded by sponsor or airline, and every free email can incorporate sponsored promotions i.e. logos or links promoting the airline’s service or sponsors. In addition to messaging, fflya provides 45,000 tours and attractions via a partnership with Viator (a Trip Advisor company) programmed to the passenger destination by flight.
 
The complete fflya hardware solution is lightweight and low-cost as it doesn’t require expensive broadband satellite connections. As a result minimal revenue is required to fund the entire installation. By providing the system on a revenue sharing basis, ASIP gains exclusive access to one of the most highly desirable markets. A captive, cashed up, leisure traveller.

CrewX (Crew Exchange) - is an entry level ultra-low cost core communications platform for business jets and the simplest way to keep crew connected. For airlines, CrewX is a Bluetooth communications framework that can be easily embedded into any existing crew App or operate as a stand-alone App, and provides a virtual private secure network for crew to enhance efficiency of crew communications on-board the aircraft, without needing to install certified aircraft servers, Wi-Fi networks or perform modifications to the aircraft systems.
 
(4) Competitive business conditions and the small business issuer's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition;
 
Competition
 
Business Jet
 
BizjetMobile is focused on the global market because of its use of satellite communications. In the USA, the business jet market is dominated GOGO Inc. (formally Aircell). GOGO’s system connects passenger devices via Wi-Fi, having implemented an exclusive terrestrial wireless radio network across the domestic United States for transmission off the aircraft. GOGO has approximately 5,577 domestic business jets connected to its system.
 
Internationally GOGO has equipped a further 4,737 aircraft with the Aircell (division of GOGO) Iridium satellite telephone systems. These are legacy satellite systems that cannot deliver Internet. ASIP’s ChiiMP system enhances the Iridium telephone with messaging services and several BizjetMobile customers are connected via the Aircell Iridium systems. GOGO is also an INMARSAT reseller and has equipped several international aircraft with Wi-Fi. These systems are mainly installed at factory on larger jets and range in price from $150 - $650K. A second company VIASAT, also competes for the large jets with a similar $650K international solution.
 
Other non US business jet competition.
 
While there are multiple Iridium Telephone System resellers globally and some with basic Iridium messaging capability, none can match the capabilities of the BizjetMobile product range as, BizjetMobile is the leader in inflight Bluetooth connectivity.
 
Airlines
 
In the airline market, fflya will compete against major Wi-Fi inflight industry players, Panasonic, Intelsat (which recently acquired GOGO’s airline business), GEE, Thales, VIASAT and INMARSAT.
 
Panasonic, GEE and Thales are resellers of satellite services, whereas VIASAT, Intelsat and INMARSAT are satellite owner-operators. The primary market for all these vendors is predominantly Tier 1 airlines and national flag carriers. These airlines provide business travellers with an adequate level of internet connectivity at a cost per flight similar to the daily rate of many 5-star hotels. In many cases, first and business class passengers receive this service free of charge.
 
Equipment, installation and certification costs on Wi-Fi platforms are substantial and where possible, most airlines will exercise the option to have it factory installed on new aircraft. Approximately 25% of the world’s airlines are currently equipped with inflight Wi-Fi, the majority of which are either in the U.S.A or are long haul wide body Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Recent forecasts suggest that half of the world’s airlines will be fully equipped by 2025.
 
The challenge for the Company to compete, is to target the remaining market and create a platform and business model that eliminates the financial risk, generates new revenue, enhances the passenger experience, and removes the high operational/user costs associated with heavy and expensive Wi-Fi platforms.
 
The Company meets these challenges by targeting only the LCA market with a platform that is 95% lighter and cheaper and controlled by a proprietary gateway protocol that is up to 90% more efficient in delivering today’s mobile App-based communications. This creates the ability to deliver a sponsored free texting

service and generate new revenue from multiple inflight e-commerce opportunities. AS-IP’s unique program targets LCA’s which represent approximately 50% of the airline world, flying mainly Boeing B737 and Airbus A320 series aircraft and carry around 2 Billion disconnected leisure passengers.
 
To deliver Wi-Fi into aircraft, all existing aviation internet providers rely on Geostationary Satellites (GEO’s). GEO’s orbit 36,000 kilometres above the equator. This creates signal latency up to 10 times greater than a mobile phone network. As a result, internet speed usually ranges between 12-15 Mbps per aircraft which is why there are constant complaints about the level of service. As on average, only 6% of passengers will pay for inflight Wi-Fi, major airlines are prepared to offer this limited capability to satisfy their frequent and business flyers. In the majority of cases, the installation and equipment is funded by the Wi-Fi service provider, so the airlines’ financial risk is mitigated.
 
Industry insiders are suggesting that having 5 companies fighting over the same major airline segment may no longer be viable. Particularly when you take into account that prior to its sale after 10 years of operation, the GOGO airline business, had yet to make a profit.
 
With the recent impact of Covid19 grounding global fleets, revenue sources for Wi-Fi providers from paying passengers has been dramatically reduced as their business models predominantly rely on business travellers. Most industry sources suggest this will be slowest area to recover, versus the leisure traveller who has been bottled up for a year.
 
fflya’s Bluetooth technology leverages off Low Earth Orbit satellites (LEO’s). As LEO’s operate 800 kilometres above the earth, latency is similar to a mobile phone network. While todays Iridium Next LEOs offer far less bandwidth than GEO’s, their low cost and low latency are perfectly suited to connect fflya’s Bluetooth app based technology.
 
fflya is future proofed as it does not rely on the high cost of broadband or Wi-Fi to deliver its services. There are 3 key components that suit LCA’s: Text, Telemetry and Credit Card Payment. All are delivered via short burst data which specifically suits the fflya Bluetooth and Iridium data platforms.
 
Future LEO networks such as OneWeb and Elon Musk’s Starlink while promoting faster speeds and lower latency, still rely on broadband. Both operate in the same frequency spectrum as the existing inflight Wi-Fi providers. The governing factor in those frequencies are the enormously expensive and large antenna ($250K).
 
Tier 1 airlines which already have the antennas installed, may see this an option if the price, service and profit potential dictates. However offering inflight internet, and actually delivering it profitably, is another story. As far as the industry is concerned, the jury is still out.
 
The Company believes it will be able to compete with other companies in both the business aircraft and commercial airline fields because of our very low equipment costs, unique business model and little or no certification issue.
 
(5) Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers; amortization, engineering, marketing and communication costs
 
The principal supplier of systems and services to the company is ASiQ, controlled by Ron Chapman, the President of the Company. As part of the original IP acquisition agreement, the Company was required to secure the service of Ron Chapman. It is Ron and ASIQ’s reputation in the aviation industry, that provides the credibility, drives the direction and creates the programs for the Company. The Chapman family controls all marketing on behalf of the Company.
 
(6) Dependence on one or a few major customers;
 
The Company will be dependent on its distributors to market the product to generate income from hardware sales and service fees and its airline marketing partners to secure airline programs. The timing and extent of that marketing will be dependent on the resources and efforts of the Company, its distributors and partners.

(7) Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration;
 
The Company originally acquired the application for an Australian patent and received notification that the International Preliminary Report on Patentability had been established. The Company filed national phase patent applications in Australia, the United States, China and European Union. In January 2010, the Company received the Australian patent. In January 2012, the Company received the Chinese patent. With the advent of Bluetooth Smart, the technology and the Company's IP has advanced to a point where the patent was no longer relevant. The Company subsequently decided to proceed no further with the patents, as the technology is predominately software based and protected by copyright.
 
(8) Need for any government approval of principal products or services. If government approval is necessary and the small business issuer has not yet received that approval, discuss the status of the approval within the government approval process;
 
Installation and use of aircraft avionics in aircraft requires prior certification and approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and equivalent regulatory authorities of foreign governments on each aircraft type and for each airline, although FAA approval is generally globally acceptable.
 
The certification process begins with the installation of the system on an aircraft after which it is certified by an FAA accredited engineer. The certification is then applicable to similar aircraft types and modified for other aircraft type. In countries other than the United States, the equivalent aviation authority procedures will apply to the certification of the system, but the United States FAA is generally accepted by local certifying authorities throughout the world. Prior to certification and approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the system has been designed and manufactured and complies with the appropriate aviation standards, namely DO160 for hardware and DO178 for software. Following this step, the system must be installed on an aircraft and tested, including a ground and flight test.
 
As the App is installed on a mobile phone or tablet, which are regarded as carry on devices, and operated in “flight” or “offline” mode, no aircraft certification is required however, in the majority of cases the final approval for use in flight will be at the discretion of the aircraft operator.
 
The business aircraft system has been designed to be is installed as a “Portable Electronic Device” PED and as such, little or no certification is required. The Company has a similar plan for airlines, which will ultimately lead to a lower cost certifiable platform.
 
Finally, the Company's Android and IOS Apps are based on a Bluetooth network and Bluetooth has been tested and documented as safe for use in aircraft, which simplifies the operator acceptance process.
 
(9) Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business;
 
The company must maintain good standing, comply with applicable local business licensing requirements, prepare and file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and comply with other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations.
 
Existing or probable governmental regulations have not impacted our operations except for the increased costs of compliance with reporting obligations. These additional costs remain consistent as long as the company continues as a reporting corporation.
 
(10) Estimate of the amount spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development activities, and if applicable the extent to which the cost of such activities is borne directly by customers;
 
The Company estimates over the last 2 years it has expended $800,000 on research and development, none of which has been borne by the customers.
 
(11) Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local); and
 
Not applicable

(12) Number of total employees and number of full time employees.
 
The company does not have any employees, instead contracts the Chief Financial Officer, as well as contracting marketing and technical services as required.
