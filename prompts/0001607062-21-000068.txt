Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in Delaware on February 26, 2019 for the purpose of acquiring all of the equity of SteriLumen and MunnWorks. The Company acquired all of the capital stock of SteriLumen in March of 2019 pursuant to two exchange agreements in which the stockholders of SteriLumen exchanged all of their shares in SteriLumen for shares of common stock in the Company. The Company acquired all of the membership interests in MunnWorks in July of 2019 pursuant to an exchange agreement in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company. The Company conducts all of its operations through SteriLumen and MunnWorks. The Company’s current acquisition strategy is to acquire disinfection device companies or other complimentary medical businesses that allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SteriLumen Disinfection System and devise and test new products, while achieving revenue and earnings growth.
 
On February 8, 2021 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Akida Holdings LLC (“Akida”) for $901,274.96 in cash and 1.375 million shares of our common stock and no assumption of any long term debt or non-operating liabilities pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 8, 2021 among the Company, SteriLumen, Akida and Akida’s members (the “Acquisition”). Prior to the Acquisition, Akida was the manufacturer of the Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, originally developed by NASA with assistance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, that uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, titanium dioxide based photocatalyst that may help to accelerate the reopening of the global economy with applications in the hospitality, hotel, healthcare, nursing homes, grocer, wine, commercial buildings and retail sectors. The Airocide™ system has been used by brands such as NASA, Whole Foods, Dole, Chiquita, Opus One, Sub-Zero Refrigerators and Robert Mondavi Wines.
 
The Airocide air purification products complement those of SteriLumen, and the distribution agreement with Akida proved successful as Akida saw significant increase in sales during the pandemic. The Akida distribution agreement helped us understand and appreciate the impact and import placed on air disinfection by the customer base we were beginning to engage. The company witnessed some key demand drivers first hand that could be profitably monetized if Akida had access to more working capital. We plan to build a path to a faster time to units and revenues through our supply chain optimization and investment in marketing to boost distribution. Akida's revenue for the full calendar year 2020 was approximately $4.7 million with EBITDA of approximately $921,000.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 8480 East Orchard Road, Suite 2400, Greenwood Village, CO 80111and our telephone number is 720-531-4152. The Company currently has 37 employees, including executive officers, all of which are fulltime. Our website address is www.applieduvinc.com. The information contained therein or accessible thereby shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Prospectus.
 
SteriLumen
 
Business Overview. SteriLumen was incorporated on December 8, 2016 in New York. SteriLumen develops and may acquire medical devices that eliminate pathogens that may cause healthcare-acquiured infections (HAIs) for distribution primarily to facilities that have high customer turnover such as hospitals, assisted living facilities, doctors’ offices and walk-in clinics as well as hotels, cruise lines, schools, airplanes and other public spaces. SteriLumen has developed and designed a unique, patented and automated disinfecting system that relies on high powered LEDs in the “C” range of the ultraviolet spectrum (UVC) that are designed into devices that work with bathroom fixtures “SteriLumen Disinfecting System”), which we believe will be effective in reducing HAIs caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and other pathogens, including the coronavirus causing COVID-19 and other human viruses around the bathroom sink and other high-touch, pathogen intensive surfaces..
 
The SteriLumen Disinfecting System was initially developed by Max Munn while working with NBBJ1, a global architectural firm, and Healthcare Surface Consultants (“HSC”)2. SteriLumen owns all of the patents and other intellectual property with respect to the SteriLumen Disinfecting System and NBBJ and HSC have waived any claims they may have to any interest in the SteriLumen Disinfecting System. The SteriLumen Disinfecting System has five product lines: (i) disinfecting back-lit mirror that replaces the typical mirror (and wall lighting) found above the sink in a public facility bathroom (in development); (ii) disinfecting drain device (on market); (iii) disinfecting shelf that can be installed above a sink, beneath an existing bathroom mirror, or above other high-contamination risk surfaces (on market); (iv) mirrored medicine cabinet for residential use (in development) and (v) retrofit kit (in development). The Company has received confirmation from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration that the SteriLumen Disinfecting System is not a “device” under Section 201(h) of the FDA Act and therefore the Company is not required to comply with the requirements of the FDA Act. However, SteriLumen’s devices are in compliance with the FDA’s March 2020 “Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers. During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency”. In addition, the disinfecting shelf (SteriLumen Ribbon) and drain (SteriLumen Drain) systems have received certification from Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the global leader in product safety testing and certification.

During the last three years SteriLumen has focused on design, development, and manufacturing of the SteriLumen Disinfecting System and has evolved the system to incorporate an application (Clarity D3™) for remote monotiring and management of, and reporting from the devices. The disinfection technology together with the application comprise SteriLumen’s Data Driven Disinfection™ platform which we believe to be the first and only safe, simple, and validated connected platform of its kind on the market.
 
We pursue validation of our platform in both laboratory and real clinical settings. Initial devices were independently tested in 2020 at ResInnova Laboratories, an International Antimicrobial Council certified BSL-2 testing facility. The disinfecting mirror and disinfecting drain devices were found to be effective in killing (3- 4 log reductions) the most infectious and clinically important pathogens including C. difficile, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), E. Coli, and OC43 human coronavirus, a strain structurally and genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2 and accepted as a surrogate for that virus. The Company is also sponsoring a study at Mount Sinai and its Icahn School of Medicine on the effectiveness of the SteriLumen Disinfecting System in patient bathrooms in a New York hospital in the Mount Sinai system. Mount Sinai has agreed to provide SteriLumen the results of their study in a report to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as publishing their results in an academic, peer reviewed journal. The study performed under the Mount Sinai Agreement will be the first test of the SteriLumen Disinfecting System in a real worldhealthcare facility setting.
 
Since its inception, SteriLumen has devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development, business planning, recruiting management and sales personnel, raising capital, developing relationships with potential suppliers and creating its own network of professional consultants. SteriLumen and Airocide product lines have manufacturing and assembly suppliers in Connecticut and Georgia in the United States, and Dongguan city in southern China; , and warehousing and distribution suppliers in California. By outsourcing the manufacturing, assembly, warehousing and distribution of our products, we can efficiently focus resources on design, marketing and sales while keeping overhead costs lower.
 
SteriLumen’s Airocide brands have enjoyed global sales in a variety of industries including healthcare, hospitality, grocery chains, wine making facilities, commercial real estate, schools, dental offices, and homes. As we bring the two brands together, delivering disinfection for both air and surfaces, initial sales efforts are targeting large commercial organizations in the sporting venue and hospitality markets in the US; we believe recent success here will support sales growth in the coming year. We intend to target international markets in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, China and Japan for both product lines, and continue to expand our global distributor network for Airocide
  SteriLumen’s Data Driven Disinfection™ platform includes products with the following attributes:
 
Focus on high-contamination surfaces Focuses on pathogens that accumulate on the sink area, including handles, faucets, backsplash and in the drain.
 
Germicidal UVC LEDs. The UVC LEDs in our devices have demonstrated destruction of the most clinically relevant pathogens causing HAIs as well as destructionof SARS-CoV2, the virus causing COVID-19 (99.8% elimination in 5 seconds at a distance of 2cm).


Automatic operation. Built-in programmable controller that ensures operation for the full UVC dosage required daily and is not dependent on manual operation. Its functionality is expandable and may become a source for recurring income through additional data reporting, leasing and maintenance of add-on elements. 
 
Continuous operation. Works in pre-programmed cycles that can be managed by a programmable controller. The motion detectors enclosed within each device allow continuous disinfection of high contamination areas as long as room occupants are within a safe distance of the device. Research has shown that microbes can rebound to pre-disinfection levels within two hours following manual terminal cleaning and disinfection. UVC products generally used for terminal cleaning in patient rooms have helped to reduce infections. Unfortunately, these can only be used after a patient is transferred/discharged and the patient room is vacant.
 
Safety. Built-in motion detector and sensor automatically shuts off the UVC light when anyone comes within range of the UVC light, eliminating safety concerns about UVC exposure. Once there is no movement in the room for 10 minutes the UVC light comes back on to restart and continue its cycle.

Removable UVC LED panel. The UVC LEDs are installed via removable panel forease of replacement or upgrade. The UVC LEDs are expected to become more powerful over time and users may want to replace the earlier generation UVC LEDs (at an interval and cost not yet determined) with more powerful models as the microbial world continues to change.
 
Ease of Installation. The unit is easy to install and uses standard electrical wiring.
 
Data and remote operations. The Clarity D3™ application enables Data Driven Disinfection™ with IOT connectivity using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other RF technology for continuous transmission of use and functionality data for collection and analysis. Clarity D3 provides remote asset management and full visibility into the operation of the SteriLumen devices as well as efficacy reporting on the cycles that have run and subsequent cleanliness status. The app also enables Smart Maintenance, with LED cartridge lifecycle alerts, fault detection/reports and automatic system updates.
 
SteriLumen Drain. Consists of a stainless-steel pipe that is easily substituted for the ordinary pipe that fits between the bathroom sink drain cover and the C-trap. A UVC LED sits in a one-half inch perforation in the pipe in the plane of the interior of the pipe in order not to disrupt water flow. The UVC light destroys 6 logs (99.9999%) of the most common pathogens, thereby disinfecting the aerosol plume that rises out of the drain when the faucet is turned on.
 
SteriLumen Ribbon. Can be installed over sinks or other high-touch/contamination risk areas.
 
Airocide® Product Line
 
The Airocide technology is based on proprietary air purification designs and methods developed with NASA and the University of Wisconsin and licensed exclusively to the company, now owned by SteriLumen. The core technology is in use on the International Space Station and is based on photo-catalytic oxidation (PCO), a bioconversion process that continuously converts damaging molds, microorganisms, dangerous pathogens, destructive volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and biological gasses into harmless water vapor.  Unlike other air purification systems that provide “active” air cleaning, ionization or “photo-electrochemical oxidation” Airocide’s nanocoating technology permanently bonds titanium dioxide to the surface of the catalytic bed. This permits the perpetual generation of surface-bound (OH-) radicals over the large surface area created by their advanced geometric design and prevents the generation and release of ozone and other harmful byproducts.  The proprietary formulation and methods for creating the catalyst are the basis of Airocide’s competitive advantage, making it the only consistently robust, highly effective, ozone free PCO technology on the market.
 
Airocide technology has been cleared by the FDA as a class II medical device, making it suitable for providing medical grade air purification in critical hospital settings such as operating rooms and surgical suites.
 
SteriLumen will market Airocide® product lines: APS (consumer units) and the GCS and HD lines (commercial units) and will enable the commercial units with Clarity D3™ to bring connectivity, reporting and asset management to our air purification products. 
 
The APS series provides true, low maintenance filterless air purification ideal for residential and small or home office spaces. The GCS series is suitable for larger public spaces and enclosed rooms that may have high occupancy such as waiting rooms and hotel lobbies. The HD series is the most powerful, providing two-stage purification for fast sanitization of industrial spaces such as wine cellars, warehouses and food-processing facilities.
 
Product line for Hospitals
 
In October of 2020, we entered into an Exclusive Licensing & Joint Development Agreement with Axis Lighting to commercialize UVC devices for the hospital market. Axis Lighting is one of the largest independent architectural lighting companies in North America and operates a manufacturing facility with on-site design, engineering, and marketing staff to deliver high-performance LED luminaires for general, ambient and task lighting in offices, as well as in commercial and institutional spaces. BalancedCare™ by Axis provides healthcare lighting for wellness, offering patent-pending performance lighting for both visual comfort and functionality. BalancedCare™ addresses a number of requirements of today's complex healthcare environment, including infection control, and is supported and distributed through 98 Axis agents across North America.
 
Under the agreement, SteriLumen will work with Axis Lighting's BalancedCare™ team to leverage SteriLumen's intellectual property and proprietary know-how to commercialize a range of new LED-based technologies designed for use in the hospital sector. Axis will pay royalties to SteriLumen on sales of the commercial products developed through the collaboration. Our first jointly developed disinfection lighting fixture has completed the design phase and will launch later this year.

Markets
 
SteriLumen’s Data Driven Disinfection™ platform for surface and air disinfection addresses the pressing need in multiple markets to provide air and surfaces that are safe from disease-causing pathogens. The longevity of the pandemic and the increasing emergence of new strains of coronavirus in addition to other new pathogens creates a new normal where not only healthcare providers and patients, but customers, teachers, students and travelers are expecting disinfection and sanitization measures from employers, retail and hospitality establishments to protect the spaces they visit and occupy. SteriLumen and Airocide devices will help to keep environments safe and reduce the risk of transmission of disease causing pathogens such as coronavirus and healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs).
Pandemic Response and Preparedness
 
As Bloomberg reported in Dec 2020 (“Unsold U.S. Hotel Rooms Near 1 Billion as Lodging Crisis Deepens”), the coronavirus pandemic has cost hotels in the United States alone more than $46 billion in room revenue in 2020. Data from UBS Advisory Program and market data provider Statista estimates that the drop in foot traffic at US retail stores is down by nearly 35%, and the retail sector stands to lose up to 17% of stores over the next few years. Commercial vacancy rates are down significantly, but according to BOMA’s International Covid-19 CRE Impact Study, 74% of respondents believe in-person office space is vital to conducting successful business operations, validating demand for solutions to create safe office environments that enable employees to return to work.
Hospital Aquired Infections (HAIs)
 
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines HAIs as infections patients contract, while receiving treatment in a healthcare facility. HAIs are a significant problem in the United States and the cause of an estimated 99,000 deaths annually. The CDC states that preventing HAIs is a national priority, citing the following sobering statistics:

• | approximately 1.7 million people in the United States contract a HAI every year, or 1 out of every 25 hospital patients; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an estimated 99,000 people die from HAI’s annually; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HAI cost to the healthcare system is $45 billion annually; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients with a HAI spend an average of 6.5 extra days in the hospital; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients with a HAI are five times more likely to be readmitted and twice as likely to die. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
HAI’s are preventable, and the federal government has instituted policies and penalties to ensure this issue is being addressed. In 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) stopped paying hospital-related reimbursement for patients who acquired a HAI during their hospital stay. In 2011, CMS established fines for facilities with high rates of infection. The effects of reduced reimbursements have seriously impacted healthcare facilities with somereporting a reduction of up to 40% of their total revenue due to lost reimbursement.
 
Environmental disinfection is an important method in reducing the risk of HAIs. Evidence shows that traditional cleaning methods still leave persistent contamination of environmental surfaces.3 Without question, secondary disinfection technologies are needed for reducing the risk of surface contamination.
 A big part of the challenge is controlling the presence of infectious agents in the patient room.
 
In SteriLumen’s platform for Data Driven Disinfection ™ addresses many of the issues that complicate effective disinfection of patient rooms and other areas at high risk for pathogen contamination including:
 
Restroom Designs: The bathroom is an area of high contamination. Toilets are located close to the sink and countertops. When flushed, they release a plume of microbial contamination into the air, ultimately landing on surfaces. Healthcare workers, the patient and visitors frequently use this room with many opportunities for acquisition and transmission of microbes throughout the patient care environment. Despite this, during a patient’s stay this room is typically cleaned only once a day.

Materials: Multiple surface materials and textiles cannot all be cleaned and disinfected effectively the same way. Surfaces that are not smooth can leave protective reservoirs for microbes to proliferate in and not be reached by the biocides used to destroy them.
 
Lack of Time: The average daily patient room disinfection time is 10 minutes (approximately 7 minutes for the main room and 3 minutes for the bathroom).
 
Despite best cleaning/disinfecting efforts, microbes can continue to thrive on surfaces for days, weeks, and even months.
 
Facilities understand the limitations of their current approach and are increasingly open to bundled or system-based solutions utilizing a variety of products and processes including “no touch” technology such as SteriLumen. No-touch systems are gaining acceptance by providing additional disinfection to the standard and required manual disinfection protocol described above. Many of these have been successful in addressing areas that may not have been disinfected effectively before. Examples of no-touch products include: (a) Hydrogen peroxide vapor or mist to get disinfectant into areas not always reached in the regular wipe-down, and (b) robotic systems that shine UVC light to kill bacteria. Each of these systems has significant limitations:
 
Room occupation: Both systems require that the room be unoccupied. As a result, they can only be used for “terminal” disinfection following patient discharge.
 
Line of sight: UVC systems require “line-of-sight” to the affected areas. Microbes on surfaces outside the line of sight of the light source are not affected. When used in a patient bathroom, for example, UVC robots cannot reach areas such as the inside of the sink bowl, drain, and areas behind the faucet.
 
The SteriLumen Disinfecting System can operate while the patient room is occupied and does not need human intervention.
 
UV Science & Technology
 
Ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet (“UV”) light is one form of electromagnetic energy produced primarily by the sun, although it can also come from man-made sources such as tanning beds and welding torches. UV light is a designated band of light (or electromagnetic energy) with wavelength from 100 to 400 nanometers (nm), which is shorter than visible light but longer than x-rays. UV light has enough energy to break chemical bonds. Due to their higher energies, UV photons can cause ionization, a process in which electrons break away from atoms. The resulting vacancy affects the chemical properties of the atoms and causes them to form or break chemical bonds that they otherwise would not. This can be useful for chemical processing, or it can be damaging to materials and living tissues. This damage can be beneficial, for instance, in disinfecting surfaces, but it can also be harmful, particularly to skin and eyes. UV is generally divided into three sub-bands: UVA, UVB, and UVC. Of the three, UVC has the shortest wavelength, the highest energy, and is most easily absorbed by most organic material.


UVC Disinfection. Using UV light to disinfect is a fast, effective, and safe technique that utilizes UVC. When exposed to UVC light, microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, cysts, and mold are affected in a way such that they can no longer multiply, rendering them harmless. UV disinfection can be used on surfaces, in air, and in water. Disinfection performance is a function of the UVC dose applied to the microorganism. While all micro-organisms respond to UVC light in different ways, if given the appropriate dose, which is the product of UVC power multiplied by time, 99.99% of micro-organisms can be killed. Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, cysts, and mold are simple life forms that reproduce by subdivision, budding, or by producing spores. Reproduction of these organisms is vital to their life cycle: loss of their ability to grow and multiply is classified as cellular death, and renders them harmless and no longer pathogenic. When exposing microorganisms to UVC light, the energy generated from UVC light is absorbed into the microbes’ cellular RNA and DNA, damaging nucleic acids and preventing microorganisms from infecting and reproducing. The absorption of UVC energy forms new bonds between nucleotides, creating double bonds or “dimers.” Demineralization of molecules, particularly thymine, is the most common type of damage done to microorganisms by UVC. Formation of thymine dimers in the DNA of bacteria, fungi and viruses prevents replication and the ability to infect. Because UVC disinfection does not rely on chemicals or filtration materials, it can be used effectively and safely in many applications including in drinking water, in air.
 
LEDs. The traditional approach to generating UV light for disinfection applications has been the mercury discharge lamp, which is a fluorescent bulb without the phosphor coating. Recent advances in LED technology produced novel UV LEDs that generate specific UV wavelengths from solid-state microchips. Miniature, robust, and operating with a low electrical power, UV LEDs, unlike traditional mercury lamps, deliver highly stable output at the specific wavelengths needed for the application. LEDs also allow flexibility in design and can be arranged in a variety of designs includingflat panels, on flexible circuit boards, on the outside of cylinders and elsewhere.

Our Strategy 
 
AUVI seeks to acquire products, companies and technologies to complement its business in infection control and expand its offerings that protect people and environments from dangerous pathogens. We will also consider select acquisitions in medical devices or equipment that can be sold to the same customer base as our current products, which give us access to significant new markets, or which meet unmet needs in our current markets.
 
For our SteriLumen subsidiary, we believe that together, SteriLumen and Airocide devices represent safe, effective, unique and patented disinfecting systems that may significantly reduce the number of pathogens found in healthcare, industrial, educational and commercial facilities. Our initial targets for the combined solution of SteriLumen and Airocide are large commercial organizations in the sporting venue and hospitality markets in the United States.
 
Our goal is to build a company that successfully designs, develops and markets our platform for Data Driven Disinfection which will enable national economies to re-open and provide safe environments during and following the pandemic. Our platform will also be positioned to help decrease the national rate of HAIs. We will seek to achieve this goal by having SteriLumen actively involved in the following activities:
 
• | Focus on large facilities in hospitality and sporting venues: this market segment has strong incentives to invest in additional disinfection to ensure guests and patrons return and left sales to pre-pandemic levels. Hotels, particularly those wishing to make disinfection, safety, and cleanliness part of their branded experience. In addition, our initial research indicates that the key stakeholders in this market value the asset management and reporting capabilities of our platform and provide key points of differentiation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secondary focus on healthcare facilities outside of the hospital market: (i) Target infection prevention professionals in healthcare facilities including assisted living and long term care, clinics and ambulatory surgical centers.; (ii) Identify and target facilities that have been fined for high infection rates. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage relationships with Environmental Health and Safety organizations who are responsible for employee safety

Other Market Segments
 
Beyond healthcare facilities, we are prioritizing our opportunities in additional market segments:
 
Airplane and Cruise Line Bathrooms. Because of the close quarters inside most airplane cabins, pathogens can easily be spread among passengers, especially on long flights where airplane bathrooms have more use and may not be cleaned before flight’s end. SteriLumen’s Data Driven Disinfection platform could provide an important means for disinfecting airplane bathrooms, keeping track of cleanliness during flights, and decreasing the spread of germs in the airplane cabin.
 
Schools. Schools and education authorities pay very close attention to disinfection to prevent the spread of influenza as well as other contagious threats. The CDC maintains guidelines for disinfection of schools and many other organizations also advise schools on proper disinfection protocol. SteriLumen’s disinfection systems could find a receptive audience among school facilities managers looking for new solutions to this issue.
 
Restaurants. Given the need to prevent foodborne illness, restaurants are constantly urging staff to wash their hands and are required by public health authorities to keep their premises as clean and germ-free as possible. SteriLumen could become part of upscale restaurants’ strategy to demonstrate dedication and commitment to customers and health department to reduce the spread of infections within their establishment.
 
Homes. Our Airocide brands have a strong foothold in the consumer marketplace and we will expand digital marketing activities to gain greater market share.
 
Competition
 
Given the uniqueness of the SteriLumen Disinfection Platform, we are not aware of any direct competition. However, there are indirect competitors utilizing UVC in ceiling and robot configurations as well as other no-touch chemical and “fog” disinfection systems.
 
No-touch Systems. No-touch systems have increased in popularity in recent years as complimentary and add on systems for addressing infection prevention issues following required cleaning and disinfection protocols. These have proven to be effective with a few major drawbacks. They are used only following patient transfer or discharge and cannot be used while the patient room is occupied. Due to the high cost for no touch systems, healthcare facilities generally choose one of several no-touch options, either UVC robots or peroxide vapor. An additional issue exists based on the available time for terminal disinfection if patients are waiting for a room or if staff is simply too busy to move this technology into the room and turn it on and off. Depending on the technology, the disinfecting system may need to be moved into the bathroom (additional cycle time) due to the constraints of the technology.
 
This system requires approximately 2 hours’ time in a completely sealed off room plus additional time to allow the air to clear before anyone can remove the seals put in place.

UVC systems. UVC disinfection is fast and very effective on surfaces in line of sight. Products on the market include but are not limited to ceiling mounted, wall-mounted, upper air UV disinfection units as well as UVC robots. Larger robot units recommend that their units be moved periodically to address critical areas that may be limited by shadowing or areas outside of the direct line of sight. Typically, the larger robots are used for terminal cleaning when the patient is discharged as a room must be empty to run these units. There are several manufacturers currently developing other products including smaller portable units that could be put in a patient room while the patient is receiving treatment elsewhere in the hospital. The competitive advantage of the SteriLumen system is its use of UVC LEDs. All of the below systems which generate UV light use mercury or xenon bulbs which are inherently dangerous if mishandled.
 
Peroxide vapor systems. Hydrogen peroxide vapor systems use machines to disperse a concentrated hydrogen peroxide vapor throughout a room. The micro condensation of the system on all surfaces deactivates harmful pathogens. The peroxide condensate breaks down to oxygen and water vapor, which means there is no harmful residue. Like UVC robot systems, peroxide vapor systems cannot be run when a patient is in the room. Furthermore, there is a need to seal the room and for personnel to wear hazmat suits during the disinfection process.
 
Competition in Air Purification 
 The Airocide technology is unique in the marketplace, offering numerous advantages over legacy technologies currently on the market such as HEPA filtration methods. Air purifiers relying on filter media, such as HEPA, trap contaminants, but can allow microscopic viruses to pass through unaffected. Ionizers or ozone generators can cause health issues when utilized in confined spaces. Electrostatic filters can quickly become contaminated and rendered ineffective. Unlike these conventional technologies, Airocide relies on a photo-catalytic reaction that enables it to destroy, rather than trap, even the most minute organic impurities in the air. From viruses to mold spores to volatile organic gases, Airocide offers unmatched efficacy in air purification technology as demonstrated in multiple independent laboratory tests.
 
MunnWorks
 
MunnWorks was formed on November 9, 2012, as a New York limited liability company. manufactures and supplies fine decorative framed mirrors, framed art, and vanities to primarily to the hospitality market. Max Munn, the President of Applied UV, is also the Chief Executive Officer of MunnWorks and has been involved in related businesses for over 35 years. MunnWorks manufactures its products domestically and overseas. Its domestic manufacturing operations are located in its headquarters in Mount Vernon, New York. MunnWorks supplies the major hotel brands in North America with its products. These brands include Hilton Hotels & Resorts, the various Hyatt branded hotels, the various Marriott branded hotels, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and the subsidiary hotel brands for each of these major brands. MunnWorks has a national sales force and an established distribution network for hotels and restaurants in every major market in the United States and has begun to develop a distribution network for the assisted living market. These distribution networks will also be a significant asset for SteriLumen, as those networks will be utilized for the marketing and sales of the SteriLumen Disinfecting System. Additionally, MunnWorks advertises its products in hotel design magazines and participates in major national trade shows. During the last three years, MunnWorks has significantly expanded its sales force, including hiring a vice president of sales, increased investments in advertising, including expanding its presence at industry trade shows and full-page advertising in trade magazines such as Boutique Design and Hospitality Design and establishing a presence on social media outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. MunnWorks currently manufactures approximately 20% to 25% of its products domestically, but expects this to increase to 35% due to increasing lead times, production costs and tariffs associated with manufacturing goods in China. We consider MunnWorks to be a leader in the custom design decorative framed mirror market. Our main competitors are Majestic Mirror located in Miami, Florida and Mirror Image located in Los Angeles who make decorative mirrors for hotels and Electric Mirror located in Seattle Washington who make backlit mirrors that are placed over vanities in the bathroom. None of these competitors have any meaningful domestic manufacturing capability.
 
On June 25, 2018, MunnWorks filed a voluntary petition for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in order to (i) pursue its appeal of a $1.4 million New York State court judgment arising out of an employment and business dispute with a former employer of Mr. Munn (of which Mr. Munn’s family-owned 50% of the equity) and (ii) preserve its ongoing operations from collection efforts with respect to such judgment. MunnWorks settled the dispute by making a $400,000 cash payment and on June 28, 2019, concluded its Chapter 11 proceedings.
