As mentioned above, there are four Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions product lines that are focused on the use of PII applications and insights: End-to-End Insurance and Fleet Management, each of which are planned to launch in 2023, and Remote Diagnostic services and Roadside Assistance services, each of which are expected to be offered in the future. Further detail of these product lines are as follows:
1-End-to-End Insurance Services
Our End-to-End Insurance offerings, are still in development, and will focus on using connected vehicle data for usage-based insurance policies, including pay-as-you-drive and pay-how-you-drive. We also will develop applications in partnership with our customers to support risk assessment, risk management and claims management. Our Insurance Services use cases target more accurately estimating and paying damages, enabling claims savings and lowering insurance premiums. 
As part of our Insurance Services, we intend to use vehicle and driving data to create driver risk profiles for users that opt-in, understand accurate vehicle usage, provide data for crash reconstruction, for claims analysis and to assist in fraud detection. We believe that these proposed services will allow insurers to provide value-added services to consumers, such as integrating vehicle data into their mobile apps and distributing policies directly through in-vehicle propositions. Our approach is focused on disrupting where existing data sources are used, and developing markets for new propositions that only connected vehicle data can enable. Target customers for our Insurance Services include insurers, underwriters, brokers and insurance management platforms. 
In addition, we expect to soon offer Insurance Services that will allow insurance companies to monitor driving trends as an input to insurance risk and to validate the status of road networks to support claims analysis. In late 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Sompo Holdings, Inc. (“Sompo Holdings”) that we believe lays the groundwork for creating a digital insurance product for the Japanese insurance market. In 2022, Wejo and Sompo Holdings expanded their relationship with our co-development agreement, and signed an agreement to provide Neural Edge ADEPT services to Sompo Holdings. In 2023, we expect to announce new relationships across End-to-End Insurance in the U.S. market. The future TAM for the Insurance Services product line is estimated to be $5.0 billion.

Competitive Strengths
Our leadership in the connected vehicle data market and the billions of data points that we ingest and standardize every day, live from vehicles in near real-time, enables us to provide products and services that make our roads safer, smarter, and more sustainable. While we are still early in the launch of many of our Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions products, we already have a proven track record of contributing to Traffic Management solutions, through the first product we have launched, Traffic Management. We have launched our visualization tools platform Wejo Studio and have gained our first major OEM customer for data management services. We expect to expand to numerous customers in Wejo Software & Cloud Solutions with expanded software and visualization tools, solutions and services.
One of Wejo’s fundamental competitive advantages for Smart Mobility is in its proprietary data sets sourced directly from vehicle-integrated sensors. This data, combined with insights that Wejo creates from numerous data sets, machine learning and artificial intelligence, provides more accurate near real-time and in-journey data as compared to current market technology that relies on inferred mobile data and after-market devices. For example, additional sensor data, from even a small subset of vehicles, allows our uniquely differentiated technology to provide near real-time insights into road and environmental conditions. As of December 31, 2022, Wejo had 20.8 million monetizable vehicles on the Wejo Neural Edge platform, a 29% increase over the prior year-end. Of these monetizable vehicles, 13.9 million were active on the Wejo Neural Edge platform within the last six months of which we ingested and standardized their related data, tracking over 78.8 million journeys and 17.6 billion data points a day, primarily in the United States. Based on existing OEM, automotive suppliers (Tier 1) and distributor (automotive dealer) relationships, we expect that near-real time live streaming vehicles on our platform will increase to 124 million connected vehicles by 2030.
Wejo’s relationships with OEMs have enabled us to develop a deep understanding of different ways connected vehicle data is generated; put simply, no two OEMs have the same way of describing data such as location, speed or braking events. As a result, the Company has developed a proprietary cloud platform, Wejo Neural Edge, which enables data from any OEM to be standardized into a common data model, and a portion of the data is used to develop a rich understanding of the environment around connected vehicles, even in areas where the number of connected vehicles is modest relative to the broader population of vehicles. Through Wejo Neural Edge, our customers may consume the data and data insights without having to deal with the complexities of large data sets and cumbersome data standardization behind the scenes. We expect that as we gain more customers, our common data model will become more widely recognized as the standard that customers expect. We believe that this will open the opportunity for our transformational impact on the future of mobility, autonomous vehicles and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Wejo aims to become the standard for Smart Mobility, as ubiquitous and recognizable as Bluetooth.

The Company believes there is significant opportunity to continue to expand Wejo's customer base. Through the growth of the Company's sales and marketing departments, the Company intends to engage prospective customers, increase brand awareness, and continue to educate investors with Wejo's platform and products. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 108 customers across a variety of industries and sectors, including universities, municipalities, and OEMs, representing a 59% increase over the prior year. 
Expansion of Existing Customer Base
Wejo is expanding its customer base in multiple ways. Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions will expand from one product line currently in operation to multiple product lines over the next several years, and the number of market verticals to which we will sell these solutions will expand significantly as we roll out new product lines to serve these markets. We are expanding our base of larger enterprise customers in both Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions and Wejo Software & Cloud Solutions. 
 Technology Overview 
Wejo Neural Edge is our proprietary cloud platform designed to support and maximize the value proposition in Smart Mobility connected vehicle data. The Company monetizes its proprietary data lake by delivering valuable insights for customers through product offerings via the Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions and Wejo Software & Cloud Solutions. Additionally, through machine learning and proprietary algorithms, Wejo can offer its own solutions for customers to offer compelling end market applications to enhance products and offer new value creating opportunities. 
The Company's source-agnostic interfaces provide flexible integration with OEM and Fleet provider data, while the high- performance architecture, built by Wejo, rapidly ingests, cleanses and integrates the data into the Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions. 
The data used in the Company's products is received live, directly from vehicle sensors via the OEM and cloud interface and not gathered from third-party devices or mobile data. This exclusive, proprietary data set creates a significant strategic advantage; insights the Company provides through its products are uniquely differentiated because we receive a majority of our data every 1-5 seconds in-journey (we are not limited to post-journey data), which allows us to provide near real-time insights to the marketplace. We are able to deliver data from vehicle to customer in less than 60 seconds.

Sustaining Innovation 
Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain the Company's competitive advantage. With the Wejo Neural Edge platform, the Company currently ingests over 17.6 billion data points a day. Over the next two to three years, the Company expects to expand its platform to ingest data globally, to expand into additional marketplaces and continue to provide business insights to its OEM preferred partners. 
Data Privacy 
 Various laws, including GDPR and CCPA, impose obligations restricting the collection, use and transfer of personal data. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various states enforce consumer protection laws to impose obligations on the collection and use of consumer data and on security measures for protecting that data. Similarly, any country that Wejo may enter into for business may have related or more stringent personal data, consumer protection and cybersecurity requirements. The obligations that these laws and regulations impose can be extensive, including but not limited to restrictions on when data can be collected from a person, requirements to obtain consent to collect data from a person, requirements to disclose how data is collected, used and stored, requirements for extensive record keeping on systems processing personal data, geographic limitations on where the data can be stored and processed, contractual obligations that must be maintained with data providers and data recipients, standard contract clauses approved by the European Union (“EU”) when transferring data outside of the European Economic Area, responding to consumer inquiries, notifying regulatory authorities about data breaches, and designating data protection officers. Wejo has incorporated into the platform and the operations features and processes that the Company believes allow us to comply with these types of laws and regulations in the locations where we currently collect data.
Before we begin services in a new country, we review applicable laws and regulations and create a plan to update our systems and operating procedures, including for managing PII, if necessary, to comply with all local data and related consumer protection requirements. In addition, we also maintain operations in the UK. The EU Commission has released a decision declaring UK data protection obligations adequate. Wejo is well-positioned to continue to transfer data between the UK and the EU. Failure to comply with any of the laws and regulations discussed in this section can result in fines and penalties. For example, failing to comply with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. If at any time our platform or operations are found noncompliant with these requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted. Meeting the obligations imposed by any of the above laws and regulations or any similar laws and regulations that may apply to our current and future business will impact our business. 
Information Security
The Company has maintained over the past 5 years, and will continue to strive to uphold security governance certifications, including Cyber Essentials Plus, IASME Gold and ISO27001 (since 2020) certifications, the combination of which indicates our approach to using that best practice and support our commitment to serving our data subjects and customers by protecting all data in keeping with legislative and regulatory requirements.
 Human Capital Resources
Oversight and Management
Attracting, developing and retaining top talent is key to our growth, and our success depends on cultivating an engaged and motivated workforce. Our goal is to create a welcoming, diverse and inclusive environment for all our employees, and the tone is set from the top. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters. For example, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the environmental, social, governance trends, issues and concerns. In addition, our Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, developing and reviewing executive management succession plans and reviewing the Company’s compensation policies for executives. Our Human Resources department is tasked with managing employee-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, compensation and benefits, performance management, and learning and development. In addition, our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues.
Wejo strives to foster the best possible work environment for all employees. Integrity, honesty, and sound judgment are fundamental to our reputation and success. We comply with laws, rules and regulations, holding ourselves to high standards of ethical business conduct in every aspect of our business dealings. We have a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), which sets forth the basic guidelines that we all must follow. The Code of Conduct serves as a guide for what to do when faced with legal or ethical questions and promotes the high ethical standards to which we are committed.

Employee Compensation, Benefits and Wellness
We consider our people to be crucial to our success, meaning we value the importance of attracting and retaining the best talent. We offer market competitive compensation packages including equity and retirement benefits for all employees, with UK leaders and managers and all U.S. employees receiving healthcare benefits.
We value the importance of mental wellness and health, and promote regular work breaks and protected personal time. We are also committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of everyone. Where required, we provide home-office furniture, including ergonomic chairs and desks to ensure people’s working conditions are appropriate. We believe this contributes to our low work-related personnel injury rate. 
Employee Engagement
Wejo places importance on the employee experience through communication, engagement, alignment and ensuring our employees feel valued. We strive to continually improve all elements of engagement through surveys, monthly all-staff briefings, social events, our internal intranet, goals and regular 1:2:1’s. While none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, we do have employee representatives for the purpose of information sharing and consultation. This channel is used to communicate matters of interest affecting employees and social/charities. We review best practice in order to improve ways of working, including policy, legislative changes and/or employment terms. 
Leadership Development and Training
Other key focus areas are Leadership Development and Success Management. We support career development by designing and investing in resources such as our Success Management tool designed to identify strengths and development areas by department. All employees have access to a blended solution of learning support, ranging from induction and on-the-job-training to e-learning solutions and coaching and professional development. We are also investing in our leadership population specifically, with our key signature programs aimed at building high performing teams and leading through change. Our learning and development strategy is aimed at building capability for today and the future and investing in our employee’s careers within Wejo.
Diversity & Inclusion
We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, citizenship status, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets standards for appropriate behavior, and are required to attend annual training on the Code of Conduct. 
Wejo does not in any way or under any circumstances tolerate or ignore bullying, harassment, or victimization, and therefore the Company treats all allegations and situations seriously. We also sponsor charities for the good of embracing life's differences. We govern ourselves through our commitment to diversity and equality through our Equality, Diversity and Discrimination Policy, which embraces individual viewpoints, cultures, preferences and experiences.
