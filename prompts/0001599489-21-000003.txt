ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Veritiv Corporation ("Veritiv" or the "Company" and sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we", "our" or "us") is a leading North American business-to-business full-service provider of value-added packaging products and services, as well as facility solutions, print and publishing products and services. Additionally, Veritiv provides logistics and supply chain management solutions to its customers. Veritiv's focus on segment-tailored market leadership in distribution and a commitment to operational excellence allows it to partner with world class suppliers, add value through multiple capabilities and deliver solutions to a wide range of customer segments.
We operate from 125 distribution centers primarily throughout the United States ("U.S."), Canada and Mexico, serving customers across a broad range of industry sectors. These sectors include manufacturing, food processing and service, fulfillment and internet retail, property management, higher education, healthcare, entertainment and hospitality, commercial printing and publishing.
Veritiv's business is organized under four reportable segments: Packaging, Facility Solutions, Print, and Publishing and Print Management ("Publishing"). This segment structure is consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is Veritiv's Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the Company's business. The Company also has a Corporate & Other category, which includes certain assets and costs not primarily attributable to any of the reportable segments as well as our Veritiv logistics solutions business, which provides transportation and warehousing solutions. The following summary describes the products and services offered in each of the reportable segments:
•Packaging – Veritiv is a global provider of packaging products, services and solutions. The Packaging segment provides custom and standard packaging solutions for customers based in North America and in key global markets. We service our customers with a full spectrum of packaging product materials within the fiber-based, flexible and rigid categories. The business is strategically focused on higher growth industry sectors including manufacturing, food processing and service, fulfillment and internet retail, as well as niche sectors based on industry and product expertise. Veritiv's packaging professionals create customer value through supply chain solutions, structural and graphic packaging design and engineering, automation, workflow and equipment services and kitting.
•Facility Solutions – Veritiv is a global provider of hygiene and facility solutions products and services. The Facility Solutions segment sources and sells cleaning, break-room and other supplies such as towels, tissues, commercial cleaning chemicals, personal protective equipment and safety supplies, wipers, can liners, soaps and sanitizers, dispensers, sanitary maintenance supplies and equipment, hazard supplies, and shampoos and amenities primarily in North America. Through this segment we manage a world class network of leading suppliers in most facilities solutions categories. Additionally, we offer total cost of ownership solutions with re-merchandising, budgeting and compliance reporting, inventory management, and a sales-force trained to bring leading vertical expertise to the major North American geographies. 
•Print – The Print segment sells and distributes commercial printing, writing, copying, digital, specialty products, graphics consumables and graphics equipment primarily in North America. This segment also includes customized paper conversion services of commercial printing paper for distribution to document centers and form printers. Our broad geographic platform of operations coupled with the breadth of paper and graphics products, including our exclusive private brand offerings, provides a foundation to service national, regional and local customers across North America.
•Publishing – The Publishing segment sells and distributes coated and uncoated commercial printing papers to publishers, retailers, converters, printers and specialty businesses for use in magazines, catalogs, books, directories, gaming, couponing, retail inserts and direct mail primarily in the U.S. This segment also provides print management, procurement and supply chain management solutions to simplify paper and print procurement processes for our customers.

Our History
Veritiv was established in 2014, following the spin-off of International Paper Company's ("International Paper") xpedx distribution solutions business ("xpedx") and the merger (the "Merger") of xpedx with UWW Holdings, Inc. ("UWWH"), the parent company of Unisource Worldwide, Inc. ("Unisource"). Following the Merger, Veritiv's common stock began regular-way trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 2, 2014 under the ticker symbol "VRTV".
On August 31, 2017, Veritiv completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in various All American Containers entities (collectively, "AAC"), a family owned and operated distributor of rigid packaging products, including plastic, glass and metal containers, caps, closures and plastic pouches. The acquisition of AAC aligns with the Company's strategy of investing in higher growth and higher margin segments of the business. Through the acquisition, Veritiv gained expertise in rigid plastic, glass and metal packaging that complements its portfolio of packaging products and services. This acquisition also provided Veritiv with additional marketing, selling and distribution channels into the growing U.S. rigid packaging market.
Products and Services
Veritiv distributes well-known national and regional brand products as well as products marketed under its own private label brands. Products under the Company's private label brands are manufactured by third-party suppliers in accordance with specifications established by the Company. Our portfolio of private label products includes:
•Packaging products under the TUFflex brand, which include stretch film, mailers, shrink film, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes;
•Foodservice disposable products, cleaning chemicals, towels and tissues, can liners, sanitary maintenance supplies and a wide range of facility supplies products under the Reliable, Spring Grove and PUR Value brands; and
•Coated and uncoated papers, coated board and cut size under the Endurance, nordic+, Comet, Starbrite Opaque Select and other brands.
The table below summarizes sales of products sold under private label brands as a percentage of the respective reportable segment's or total Company's net sales for the periods shown:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018
Packaging | 6% | 6% | 6% 
Facility Solutions | 8% | 9% | 9% 
Print | 20% | 19% | 19% 
Total Company | 9% | 9% | 10% 

Customers
We serve customers across a broad range of industry sectors, through a variety of means ranging from multi-year sales agreements to transactional sales. For many of its largest customers, the Company enters into multi-year contracts that set forth the terms and conditions of sale including product pricing and incentive agreements, which are generally based on sales volume targets. The Company's customers are generally not required to purchase any minimum amount of products under these agreements and can place orders on an individual purchase order basis. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the Company's consolidated net sales. 
Suppliers
We purchase our products from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, across different business segments. Although varying by segment, the Company's suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label products and, to a more limited extent, independent regional and private label suppliers. Suppliers are selected based on customer demand for the product and a supplier's total service, cost and product quality offering. 
Our sourcing organization supports the purchasing of well-known national and regional brand products as well as products marketed under our own private label brands from key national suppliers in the packaging, facility solutions and print industries. The Publishing segment primarily operates as a direct ship business aligned with the Company's core supplier strategy. In addition, under the guidance and oversight of the sourcing team, our merchandising personnel, located within individual distribution centers, source products not available within our core offering in order to meet specialized customer needs.
The product sourcing program is designed to ensure that the Company is able to offer consistent product selections and market competitive pricing across the enterprise while maintaining the ability to service localized market requirements. Our procurement program is also focused on replenishment which includes purchase order placement and controlling the total cost of inventory by proactively managing the number of days inventory on hand, negotiating favorable payment terms and maintaining vendor-owned and vendor-managed programs. As one of the largest purchasers of packaging, facility supplies, and paper and graphics products, we can qualify for volume allowances with some suppliers and can realize significant economies of scale. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 30% of our purchases were made from ten suppliers.
Competition
The packaging, facility solutions, paper and publishing distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing growth or, in the case of paper, declining demand. The Company's principal competitors include national, regional and local distributors, national and regional manufacturers, independent brokers and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of products at prices comparable to those Veritiv offers, though at varying service levels. Additionally, new competition could arise from non-traditional sources, group purchasing organizations, e-commerce, discount wholesalers or consolidation among competitors. Veritiv believes it offers the full range of services required to effectively compete, but if new competitive sources appear, it may result in margin erosion or make it more difficult to attract and retain customers.
The following summary briefly describes the key competitive landscape for each of Veritiv's reportable segments:
•Packaging – The packaging market is fragmented and consists of competition from national and regional packaging distributors, national and regional manufacturers of packaging materials, independent brokers and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers. Veritiv believes there are few national packaging distributors with substrate neutral design capabilities similar to the Company's capabilities.
•Facility Solutions – There are few national, but numerous regional and local distributors of facility supply solutions. Several groups of distributors have created strategic alliances among multiple distributors to provide broader geographic coverage for larger customers. Other key competitors include the business-to-business divisions of big box stores, purchasing group affiliates and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers.
•Print – Industry sources estimate that there are hundreds of regional and local companies engaged in the marketing and distribution of paper and graphics products. While the Company believes there are few national distributors of paper and graphics products similar to Veritiv, several regional and local distributors have cooperated together to serve customers nationally. The Company's customers also have the opportunity to purchase products directly from paper and graphics manufacturers. In addition, competitors include regional and local specialty distributors, office supply and big box stores, online business-to-business suppliers, independent brokers and large commercial printers that broker the sale of paper in connection with the sale of their printing services.
•Publishing – The publishing market is serviced by printers, paper brokers and distributors. The Company's customers also have the opportunity to purchase paper directly from paper manufacturers. The market consists primarily of magazine and book publishers, cataloguers, direct mailers and retail customers using catalog, insert and direct mail as a method of advertising. 
We believe that our competitive advantages include approximately 1,200 sales and marketing professionals and the breadth of our selection of quality products, including high-quality private brands. The breadth of products distributed and services offered, the diversity of the types of customers served, and our broad geographic footprint in the U.S., Canada and Mexico buffer the impact of regional economic declines while also providing a network to readily serve national accounts.
Distribution and Logistics
Timely and accurate delivery of a customer's order, on a consistent basis, are important criteria in a customer's decision to purchase products and services from Veritiv. Delivery of products is provided through two primary channels, either from the Company's distribution centers or directly from the manufacturer. Our distribution centers offer a range of delivery options depending on the customer's needs and preferences, and the strategic placement of the distribution centers also allows for delivery of special or "rush" orders to many customers. 
Working Capital
Veritiv's working capital needs generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory in our distribution centers to meet delivery requirements of our customers, as well as significant accounts receivable balances. As is typical in our industry, our customers often do not pay upon receipt, but are offered terms which are dependent on the specific circumstances of the sale. 
Human Capital
Veritiv’s key human capital management objectives include attracting, developing, engaging and retaining skilled and diverse talent to drive the success of our business and to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers. These objectives are aligned with our Veritiv Values: Integrity, One Team, People Commitment, Customer Focus, Operational Excellence and Passion for Results.
Our workforce includes employees in sales, customer service, and warehouse operations in addition to corporate functions. By geography, approximately 76% and 14% of our workforce is located in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, with a presence in almost every state in the U.S. and most provinces in Canada. We also have employees located in Mexico (8%) and other countries (2%). Approximately half of our workforce is male and the other half is female.
As of December 31, 2020, Veritiv had approximately 6,400 employees worldwide, of which approximately 9% were in collective bargaining units. Approximately 63% of those employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in 2021. Labor contract negotiations are handled on an individual basis by a cross-functional team including Human Resources and Operations, with legal support. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements on satisfactory terms. We consider labor relations to be good.
Our human resources programs are designed to promote employee safety and to attract, develop, engage and retain talent. We have a robust talent review and succession planning process and our goal is to have at least one "ready now" candidate and one "ready in 1 – 3 years" candidate for each critical position to prepare candidates for critical roles. We reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs; enhance the Company’s culture through our values and other engagement efforts; develop talent internally through job rotations and learning programs to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and strive to make safety a key focus across the organization.
Some examples of programs and initiatives designed to attract, develop, engage and retain our workforce include:
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: 
◦Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Working Group developed and oversees our DEI strategy and objectives that include micro-learning modules focused on our talent acquisition teams, our managers, our leaders and our broader workforce. The key elements of our strategy are to engage with employees by creating experiences that celebrate diverse people and perspectives, equip our organization by creating a culture that encourages constant and relevant learning and empowers employees by cultivating confidence through a "One Veritiv" perspective that grows diverse and innovative leaders.
•Employee Engagement: 
◦In the fourth quarter of 2020, we hosted listening sessions to engage our employees in small group dialogue with Senior Lead Team members to encourage information sharing and drive engagement. We have developed in-depth action plans to address issues and feedback raised in the listening sessions.
•Employee Well-Being and Safety:
◦We provide comprehensive healthcare benefits to virtually all our employees in the U.S. and Canada that are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse workforce. In addition, we provide free mental and behavioral health resources, including on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents.
◦We are committed to providing all team members with a safe and healthy workplace and continuing to refine our culture of proactive safety. Managing and reducing risks at our facilities remains a focus, and injury rates have continued to be low.
•Talent Development and Learning:
◦We support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and personal development. We pay a portion of tuition costs for employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
◦A unique Company-paid program supports hourly warehouse workers to become certified, licensed truck drivers and provides opportunities to get licensed and gain required driver hours on work time. 
◦We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees gain skills and develop in their careers through a multitude of training and development programs. These include online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats as well as executive assessment, coaching, talent and succession planning.
◦A paid internship program provides job experience to high school and college students in a variety of job functions and is a source for future full-time talent.
Throughout the pandemic caused by the coronavirus ("COVID-19"), we have focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees in our distribution centers and our offices while meeting the needs of our customers and mitigating any interruptions to our business. Early in March 2020, we initiated our Corporate Incident Response Team and we adopted safety measures and practices across our facilities to limit exposure to the virus and to enhance employee safety. We modified practices at our distribution centers and offices based on guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities. These practices include social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols, usage of personal protective equipment, as well as restricting all non-essential travel and promoting remote work wherever feasible. Our employees have adapted to the changes in work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time. To thank our employees for their contributions to the Company’s success in managing through the COVID-19 pandemic by continuing to serve customers and meet business needs, we provided a cash bonus to employees who are not eligible for other bonus or commission programs. 
Government Relations
Our transportation operations are subject to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We are also subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding licensing and inspection of facilities, including compliance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and establish communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in specific products that we distribute.
We are also subject to regulation by numerous U.S., Canadian and Mexican federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. Although we are subject to other U.S., Canadian and Mexican federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment and the discharge or destruction of materials, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation 
of the Company's facilities. Compliance with these laws has not had, and is not anticipated to have, a material effect on Veritiv's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous well-recognized trademarks, represented primarily by our private label brands. See the Products and Services section of this Item 1 Business for additional information regarding our private label brand sales. Most of our trademark registrations are effective for an initial period of ten years, and we generally renew our trademark registrations before their expiration dates for trademarks that are in use or have reasonable potential for future use. Although our Packaging, Facility Solutions and Print segments rely on a number of trademarks that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single trademark is material to any one of these segments. Additionally, Veritiv does not have any material patents or licenses.
Seasonality
The Company's operating results are subject to seasonal influences.  Historically, our higher consolidated net sales have occurred during the third and fourth quarters while our lowest consolidated net sales have occurred during the first quarter. The Packaging segment net sales have traditionally increased each quarter throughout the year and net sales for the first quarter have typically been less than net sales for the fourth quarter of the preceding year.  Production schedules for non-durable goods that build up to the holidays and peak in the fourth quarter drive this seasonal net sales pattern.  Net sales for the Facility Solutions segment have traditionally peaked in the third quarter due to increased summer demand in the away-from-home resort, cruise and hospitality markets and from back-to-school activities. Within the Print and Publishing segments, seasonality is driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and direct mail primarily due to back-to-school, political election and holiday-related advertising and promotions in the second half of the year. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the Company's seasonal patterns in net sales across all segments and on a consolidated basis in 2020 due to the significant impacts of the pandemic on many of Veritiv's customers.
