History and Company Overview
Our History 
Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. (referred to herein as “the Company,” “Evoqua,” “Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.,” “EWT Holdings I Corp.,” “we,” “us,” “our”) was incorporated on October 7, 2013. On January 15, 2014, Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, EWT Holdings II Corp. and EWT Holdings III Corp., all of the outstanding shares of Siemens Water Technologies, a group of legal entity businesses formerly owned by Siemens AG (“Siemens”). The stock purchase closed on January 15, 2014 and was effective January 16, 2014 (the “Acquisition”). On November 6, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 27.8 million shares of common stock, and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on November 2, 2017 under the ticker symbol “AQUA.”
Our fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year, and references in this Annual Report to a particular year refer to that fiscal year. For example, references in this Annual Report to 2020 relate to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
Company Overview
Evoqua Water Technologies is a leading provider of mission-critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers’ full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated proprietary technology solutions sold under several market-leading and well-established brands to our global customer base. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business.
Our solutions are designed to ensure that our customers have the quantity and quality of water that meets their unique specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We deliver and maintain these mission-critical solutions through the largest service network in North America, assuring our customers continuous uptime with 92 service branches as of September 30, 2020. We have an extensive service and support network, and as a result, we have certified Evoqua Service Technicians within approximately a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our industrial North American customers’ sites.
We provide solutions across the entire water cycle. The water cycle begins with influent water, which is sourced from rivers, lakes and other sources. We treat influent water for use in a wide variety of industrial, commercial and municipal applications. In industrial applications, influent water, after it is treated, is used as process water for applications, including microelectronic production, ingredient water in the production of food, beverage and other goods, power utility applications including boiler feed water, cooling water and steam condensate. Commercial applications for influent water include laboratory testing and aquatic activities, while municipal applications for influent water include treatment to produce safe drinking water. After the water is used it is considered effluent water, and we enable its treatment through the removal of impurities so that it can be discharged safely back into the environment or reused for industrial, commercial or municipal applications.
As depicted in the table below, we target attractive global end markets that utilize and treat water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking water and wastewater, marine and aquatics end markets. While a decline in general global and economic conditions could adversely affect us, our business is highly diversified across our key attractive and growing end markets presented below, and we believe that no single end market drives the overall results of our business.
Our Industry
We estimate the global water and wastewater market to represent more than $600 billion in total revenue, including both capital and operating expenditures for the treatment of water by industrial, municipal, commercial and residential end-users. Within the global water and wastewater market, we estimate our addressable market, comprised of equipment, consumables, aftermarket parts and operations and maintenance (O&M) related services for the treatment of water for industrial, commercial and municipal end users, to represent over $85 billion in total revenue. 
Our estimated addressable market is further refined to focus on our served market, which we estimate to be approximately $8.5 billion in the North American region and approximately $7.5 billion across Europe and the Asia Pacific region, totaling approximately $16 billion in total revenue. As compared to our larger addressable market, our served market excludes sectors that would require meaningful growth investment on our part to capture new customers or market opportunities.
While a decline in general global economic and business conditions may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, we believe the global water market will continue to experience growth, supported by a variety of anticipated secular trends that will drive the demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications. These secular trends include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. More specific to our business, water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development. As such, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for solutions and services will continue to increase. Additionally, a decrease in the supply of clean water, as well as a heightened focus on environmental sustainability across various end markets, may increase the demand for 
closed-loop solutions that allow recycling and reuse of effluent for certain applications. We believe our business is well positioned to serve this demand.
We hold leading positions in our North American market verticals that have been cultivated by our suite of differentiated solutions and our comprehensive service network. However, despite our leading position in many individual market verticals where we participate, these markets remain very fragmented, and we estimate that our market share was less than 25% in most market verticals in which we participated during 2020. Evoqua selectively participates in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific with differentiated product technologies.
Fiscal Year Developments
For the year ended September 30, 2020, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.43 billion, $114.4 million and $239.6 million, respectively, with 86% of our revenues being generated in North America. For the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated revenue, net loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion, $8.5 million and $235.0 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.”
As part of the ongoing footprint rationalization and business optimization efforts that we have undertaken following the reorganization of our business into two segments at the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year and our divestiture of the Memcor product line at the end of the first quarter of our 2020 fiscal year, we have reduced our manufacturing footprint from 19 facilities as of September 30, 2019 to 13 facilities as of September 30, 2020. This includes the consolidation of facilities located in Santee, California, Coventry, Rhode Island, Bridgeport, Connecticut, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, and Singapore into other existing facilities, and the disposition of our facility in Windsor, Australia as part of the Memcor divestiture. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities for facility consolidation in fiscal 2021.
COVID-19
In response to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic in the fiscal year, we have prioritized protecting the safety of our employees and stakeholders, taking actions to ensure the resiliency of our business and managing the business for liquidity. Our business has been considered essential under federal and local standards, and, to date, we have maintained business continuity at our critical service branches and manufacturing facilities. We have taken measures to protect our employees, including implementation of remote working practices where possible and managing our supply chain to ensure that necessary personal protective equipment is available to our personnel. We have also taken certain cost reduction actions, some of which are temporary in nature, such as reduction of marketing and travel activity as well as deferment of headcount additions to preserve liquidity and reallocated existing resources to maintain productivity levels where feasible. Given the evolving nature of this unprecedented pandemic, the ultimate impact on our operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For further discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Acquisitions and Dispositions
On October 1, 2019, we acquired a 60% investment position in San Diego-based Frontier Water Systems, LLC (“Frontier”) for a purchase price of $10.9 million, net of working capital adjustments. We have entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 40% interest in Frontier on or prior to March 30, 2024. Frontier is a pioneer in the development of patented, engineered equipment packages for high-rate treatment and removal of selenium, nitrate and other metals from complex water systems. Frontier is part of our Integrated Solutions and Services segment and broadens the portfolio of solutions that we offer to our customers through that segment.
On December 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Memcor low pressure membrane product line, including the product line’s global workforce, its manufacturing site in Windsor, Australia, and associated operations and intellectual property, to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (“DuPont”). Following the closing of the transaction, we no longer service the large municipal install base of Memcor products, which consists primarily of municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities, but we continue to sell Memcor products, which we will purchase from DuPont, to our industrial customers through our Integrated Solutions and Services segment. The aggregate purchase price paid by DuPont in the transaction was $110 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Following adjustments for cash and net working capital, gross proceeds paid by DuPont were $131 million. We utilized $100 million of the proceeds from the transaction to repay a portion of our First Lien Term Loan (as defined in Note 11, “Debt” of Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) in January 2020. 
On September 3, 2020, we acquired the assets of privately held Aquapure Technologies of Cincinnati (“Aquapure”), a Hamilton, Ohio based water service and equipment company. Aquapure serves the commercial and light industrial markets and provides customers with a variety of water treatment products and services, including deionization, reverse osmosis, softeners and filtration systems. We expect this acquisition to strengthen our service capabilities in Cincinnati, Ohio and the surrounding region. 
Amendment of Credit Agreement
On February 18, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our First Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the interest rate spread applicable to our term loans was reduced. For additional information regarding the amendment to our First Lien Credit Agreement, see Note 11, “Debt,” of Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Controlled Company Status and Stock Offerings
Effective November 2, 2019, as a result of the expiration of certain voting proxies held by affiliates of AEA Investors LP (“AEA”), we no longer qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Consistent with NYSE rules, we transitioned to a fully independent Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee effective November 1, 2020, and we currently have a fully independent Audit Committee and a majority independent Board of Directors.
On March 10, 2020, we completed a secondary public offering, pursuant to which 13 million shares of our common stock were sold by affiliates of AEA and certain other selling shareholders. On August 10, 2020, we completed another secondary public offering pursuant to which 9.2 million shares of our common stock were sold by affiliates of AEA and certain other selling shareholders. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders in either of these secondary public offerings.
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our strategy include:
Grow and further penetrate our existing customer base. We believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers’ water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end markets and underpenetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers. Our growth initiatives include both expanding our presence in our core North American market as well as replicating our leading position and strategies into underpenetrated global regions.
Through direct and indirect sales efforts, outreach and education, we plan to continue to enhance our relationships and enable further adoption of our products, technologies and solutions by end customers and key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain third party sales representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, and competing for sales personnel with established customer relationships.
Continued transition of our customers to a higher value-add service-based business model. Our goal is to provide reliable water treatment solutions by combining our products and technologies with extensive service and distribution capabilities. We selectively target high-value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed internet‑connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our WaterOne® service platform, which enables customers to outsource their water treatment systems and focus on their core business, offering customers system optimization, predictive and proactive service, and simplified billing and pricing. Our WaterOne® platform also enables us to transition our customers to pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our outsourced water offerings are high value add solutions utilizing our owned assets to generate service revenues. These assets, particularly when digitally enabled, create stable, recurring and profitable revenues through greater efficiency and productivity. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and solutions, identify emerging technological trends in our target end markets and maintain the integrity of our information technology systems. 
Drive margin expansion and cash flow improvements through continued focus on operational excellence and execution. Effective October 1, 2018, we restructured our business into two reportable operating segments. We are currently on track to realize cost savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million on an annualized basis as a result of the restructuring once it is fully implemented. We expect to incur approximately $1.0 million of cash costs through fiscal 2021 as a result of this restructuring related to other non-employee related business optimizations. We have identified and are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, capturing benefits of our WaterOne® platform and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization and our sales, inventory and operations planning, including footprint rationalization. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have the capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increases in fixed costs.
Commercialize and drive adoption of nascent and newly acquired technologies by leveraging our sales channels and application expertise. We offer a full range of services, systems and technologies that we continually develop to meet our customers’ evolving water lifecycle needs. We develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, vertical market and geography-expanding, technology enhancing acquisitions. Since April 2016, we have successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, strengthening our existing capabilities and adding new capabilities and cross-selling opportunities in areas such as mobile wastewater treatment, soil and air treatment, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV and ozone disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies and electrochemical and electrochlorination cells. We must continue to develop and acquire new products, services and solutions to successfully compete in our markets.
We believe a key differentiator for our technology development program is our strong record of incorporating new technologies into the comprehensive solutions we provide to our customers across our platform. We can rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. Through our service network, we have a direct view of our customers’ water needs which allows us to focus on developing and acquiring the most relevant and sought after solutions.
We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our existing technologies and new capabilities through our channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.
Continue to expand our capabilities for the treatment of increasingly complex emerging contaminants. Emerging contaminants such as PFAS, PFOA, selenium, micro-plastics and many others, present global health risks if not properly removed from drinking water, process water and wastewater. We believe we have one of the leading portfolios of water treatment products and solutions to remove emerging contaminants from water including granular activated carbon, ion exchange resin, reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes. In addition, we have an extensive service branch network, located predominantly in the United States, as well as a large fleet of mobile assets to respond quickly to customers’ water treatment needs. 
Continue to evaluate and pursue accretive tuck-in acquisitions to add new technologies, attractive geographic regions and end markets. As a complement to our organic growth initiatives, we view tuck-in acquisitions as a key element of our overall growth strategy which will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has helped us expand our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhance our portfolio of technologies.
Protect and enhance the sustainability of our business. “Sustainable” is one of our four core values, along with Integrity, Performance and Customers. Our objective is to demonstrate this value in our operations and within our business model by providing technology and solutions to help our customers meet their own sustainability goals. We view sustainability as a key initiative and have mobilized a cross-functional team to work on advancing our Sustainability Program. Stakeholder engagement is important to our strategy development. We conducted a materiality assessment in 2019, engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and we continue to undertake purposeful stakeholder engagement through our investor relations practices, our collaboration with our Board of Directors, employee engagement surveys, customer questionnaires, focus groups and other activities. We are focusing on quantifying our environmental and social impact for customers, in part, through more efficient services enabled by our Water One digital remote monitoring systems. For information on accessing our sustainability reports, please see the heading “Available Information” below.

We maintain relationships with engineering firms, operators and other key influencers through our direct technical sales force to drive adoption of our offerings. We also maintain a comprehensive municipal representative network in the U.S., providing us with a unique ability to influence specifications and the basis of design for new treatment facilities. As of September 30, 2020, we had active relationships with more than 200 OEM partnerships and managed approximately 250 channel partners.
Research, Development and Engineering
We utilize a disciplined, stage-gate process consisting of development, field test, commercialization, supply chain and sourcing decisions to identify and develop new technologies to commercialize, focus our efforts on and engage early with supply chain management to promote profitability. We focus on tuck-in acquisitions as additional resources for new product innovation and development.
As of September 30, 2020, our global research, development and engineering footprint includes seven facilities located in the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and India, staffed with managers, scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians, along with partnerships spanning leading universities research centers and other outside agencies. 
Information Technology
Our information technology systems consist of enterprise management, e-commerce, customer relationship and field service management, customer quoting and billing, environmental compliance, business and operational support, and procurement and sales force management systems. We continue to focus on integrating our acquisitions onto our enterprise platform, standardizing our global processes and implementing cyber-security protections. In 2020, we enhanced our customer relationship and field service management platform to enable our field sales team to better service our customers.  The shift from our initial WaterOne® service platform to the next generation platform is complete, and we expect this will provide enhanced alerts, monitoring and visibility of customer installations.  We have nearly completed our infrastructure standards deployment globally, and we continue to update our information technology infrastructure through investments focused on cost efficiencies, reliability, functionality, scalability and security. We intend to continue our digital transformation with a focus on process ownership, predictive analytics and expansion of our e-commerce capabilities.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. As of September 30, 2020, we have approximately 1,300 granted or pending patents (after giving effect to patents transferred as a result of acquisitions and dispositions to date). We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by pursuing patent protection, obtaining copyrights and registering our trademarks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We currently rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employment agreements and other contractual rights, to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented and includes a number of regional and niche offering focused competitors. Competition is largely based on product performance, reliability and innovativeness of products, services and solutions, application expertise and process knowledge, brand reputation, energy and water efficiency, product compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements, product lifecycle cost, scalability, timeliness of delivery, the proximity of service centers to our customers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. Within each of our segments and the various businesses that comprise them, we compete with a fragmented range of companies, but do not have any individually key competitors.
Backlog
Backlog represents the expected future revenue for unfulfilled and remaining performance obligations for capital projects where neither Evoqua nor the customer can terminate the contract without penalty. As of September 30, 2020, our backlog was approximately $165.6 million.
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately 4,020 employees. Of these employees, approximately 57% were full-time salaried level staff and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full-time and part-time hourly workers. 
Approximately 77% of our employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 23% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities in the U.S. or Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Germany and the Netherlands, our employee populations there are represented by works councils. 
Our talent and culture are critical to our success. Our human capital management philosophy and objectives focus on creating a high performance culture in which our employees are highly enabled to deliver, highly empowered to succeed and highly accountable to lead. We seek to achieve our objectives through various employee engagement and talent development efforts. Our employee engagement efforts include our weekly company-wide newsletter and frequent all-employee town hall meetings, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency, and employee engagement surveys through which we incorporate critical employee feedback into our culture, operations and strategic plans. Our talent development efforts span across all levels of our organization, including an internship program through which we have developed strong relationships with multiple universities to attract skilled workers and assess future talent, our Leadership Development Program, a 24-month program in which future leaders participate in cross-functional rotations intended to develop their capabilities through organization-wide exposure, and our Leading at Evoqua program, a six-month customized development program in which cohorts of selected leaders throughout our organization interact closely with executive team sponsors and external facilitators to focus on self-awareness, management styles and leadership capabilities. 
Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct prohibits discrimination in our hiring and promotional practices based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, pregnancy, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or military status or any other category protected under applicable law. In fiscal 2020, we conducted a Global Leadership Gender and Pay Analysis, the results of which were reviewed with our senior leadership. This analysis included a review by function and level, as well as STEM education levels, to correlate fair share diversity. From the analysis, we found that at a macro scale, we have relative pay equity across the genders of the groups surveyed. We embrace diversity and inclusion not only in our employment practices but also in our director selection. Since October 2018, our Corporate Governance Guidelines have provided that diverse candidates, including women and minorities, must be included in each pool of candidates from which we select new directors, otherwise known as the “Rooney Rule.” Forty percent of our current Board members self-identify as diverse, in terms of race, ethnicity or gender. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic forced companies globally to reassess operations and reconsider near-term priorities, we remained focused on protecting the safety of our employees and managing the business to preserve our workforce. Health and well-being, financial stability and job security are top concerns for employees during these unprecedented times, and we have focused on addressing those concerns in meaningful ways. Through careful business management, including measures to reduce costs and increase cash conservation and liquidity, to date we have avoided layoffs, furloughs and salary reductions among our workforce. As an essential business, it was critical for us to maintain continuity of operations throughout our service branch network and manufacturing facilities, and to do so we acted quickly to obtain the personal protective equipment and to implement policies and procedures necessary to allow our employees to work safely. As a result, we have been able to maintain to date the continuity of our service branch network and manufacturing facilities without closures.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, cyber, property, business interruption, cargo, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, environmental, umbrella and excess liability insurance.
All of our insurance policies are with third party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of an A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. The continued availability of appropriate insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms is important to our ability to operate our business and to maintain our reputation. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive and varied laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to anti‑corruption and trade, data security and privacy, employment, workplace safety, public health and safety, product safety, intellectual property, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We operate our business in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
In particular, our international operations subject us to laws and regulations related to anti-corruption and trade, including those related to export and import compliance, anti-trust, anti-bribery and money laundering. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations, and we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, any violation of such laws, regulations or policies could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, debarment from government contracts and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption and trade laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in fines and criminal penalties, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.”
In certain countries where we operate, our employees are represented by a works council, as required by local law. In such countries, we are required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils in connection with certain corporate decisions, such as a major restructuring, a change of control or changes to local management. Certain other decisions that directly involve employment matters applicable either to all employees or certain groups of employees may also require works council approval. Further, certain of our international operations offer employees defined benefit plans in compliance with applicable local legal provisions requiring payments of, among other things, mandatory pension payments or allocations for severance pay. None of our U.S. or Canadian employees are represented by unions or works councils, and our U.S. and Canadian operations do not maintain defined-benefit plans.
In addition, there are numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. If our efforts to protect the security of information about our customers, suppliers and employees are unsuccessful, a significant data security breach may result in costly government enforcement actions, private litigation and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could suffer. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, our business and reputation could suffer.” Further, governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business.
Environmental Matters
The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject us to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, emissions to air, the treatment and discharge of drinking water and wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes, product safety and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment, remedial actions or the pulling of products from the market, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, the products we distribute, the services we provide and the business of our customers, and the interpretation or enforcement of these laws 
and regulations, are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Should environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs could increase‑ and significant capital expenditures or operational restrictions could be required, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, such increased stringency could also increase demand for our products, services and solutions, which assist various industries and municipalities in meeting environmental and safety requirements for the treatment and discharge of drinking water and wastewater. In addition, increased public awareness of the presence and human health impacts of manmade chemicals and naturally occurring contaminants in drinking water may increase demand for our municipal service offerings. Correspondingly, if stringent laws or regulations are delayed or are not enacted, or repealed or amended to be less stringent, or enacted with prolonged phase‑in periods, or not enforced, then demand for our products and services may also be reduced.
The nature of our operations, which involve the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes, exposes us to the risk of liability and claims associated with contamination at our current and former facilities or sites where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste, or with the impact of our products and services on human health and safety and the environment. Laws and regulations with respect to the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous materials upon statutorily defined parties, including us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. We have been subject to claims and remediation obligations, including having been named as a potentially responsible party, in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and similar state and foreign laws, regulations and statutes, and may be named a potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the future. Unforeseen expenditures or liabilities may arise in connection with such matters.
