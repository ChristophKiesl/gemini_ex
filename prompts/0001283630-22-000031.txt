Item 1.  Business
Overview
American Campus Communities, Inc. (“ACC”) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that commenced operations effective with the completion of an initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. ACC is one of the largest owners, managers, and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. ACC is a fully integrated, self-managed, and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing, and management of student housing properties. 
ACC is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”) and contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to American Campus Communities Operating Partnership LP (“ACCOP” or “the Operating Partnership”). In return for those contributions, ACC receives a number of units of the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) equal to the number of common shares it has issued in the equity offering. Contributions of properties to the Company can be structured as tax-deferred transactions through the issuance of OP Units in the Operating Partnership. Based on the terms of ACCOP’s partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged for ACC’s common shares on a one-for-one basis. The Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units of the Operating Partnership issued to ACC and American Campus Communities Holdings, LLC (“ACC Holdings”), the general partner of ACCOP, and the common shares issued to the public.
As used in this report, unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “ACC,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean American Campus Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including ACCOP.

As of December 31, 2021, our total owned and third-party managed portfolio included 203 properties with approximately 140,900 beds.
Business Objectives, Investment Strategies, and Operating Segments
Business Objectives
Our primary business objectives are to create long-term stockholder value by deploying capital to develop, redevelop, acquire, and operate student housing communities, and to sell communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable.  We believe we can achieve these objectives by continuing to implement our investment strategies and successfully manage our operating segments, which are described in more detail below. Our business objectives align with our commitment to corporate responsibility, in which we focus on creating healthy, sustainable environments with a sense of community and connection, giving back to the communities we serve, and investing in our employees.
Investment Strategies
We seek to own high quality, well designed, and well located student housing properties. We seek to acquire or develop properties in markets that have stable or increasing student populations, are in submarkets with barriers to entry and provide opportunities for economic growth as a result of their product position and/or differentiated design and close proximity to campuses, or through our superior operational capabilities. We believe that our reputation and established relationships with universities give us an advantage in sourcing acquisitions and developments and obtaining municipal approvals and community support for our development projects.
Our experienced development staff intends to continue to identify and acquire land parcels in close proximity to colleges and universities that offer location advantages or that allow for the development of unique products that offer a competitive advantage.  We expect to continue to benefit from opportunities derived from our extensive network with colleges and universities as well as our relationship with certain developers with whom we have previously developed student housing properties.
Operating Segments
We define business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided. We have identified four reportable segments: Owned Properties, On-Campus Participating Properties, Development Services, and Property Management Services. For a detailed financial analysis of our segments’ results of operations and financial position, please refer to Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Property Operations
Unique Leasing Characteristics: Student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis, unlike multifamily housing where leasing is by the unit.  Individual lease liability limits each resident’s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate’s rent.  A parent or guardian is generally required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income or financial aid.  The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore approximately equivalent to the number of beds occupied and not the number of units. Leases at our off-campus properties typically require 12 monthly rental installments, whereas leases for our residence hall properties typically correspond to the university’s academic year and require ten monthly rental installments.  Please refer to the property table contained in Item 2 – Properties for a listing of the typical rent payment terms at our properties.  As an example, in the case of our typical off-campus leases, the commencement date coincides with the commencement of the respective university’s Fall academic term, and the termination date is the last day of the subsequent summer school session.  As such, we must re-lease each property in its entirety each year.

Management Philosophy: Our management philosophy is based upon meeting the following objectives:
•Satisfying the specialized needs of residents by providing the highest levels of customer service;
•Developing and maintaining an academically oriented environment via a premier residence life/student development program;
•Maintaining each project’s physical plant in top condition;
•Maximizing revenue through the development and implementation of a strategic annual marketing plan and leasing administration program; and
•Maximizing cash flow through maximizing revenue coupled with prudent control of expenses.
Owned Properties: Our off-campus properties are generally located in close proximity to the school campus, generally with pedestrian, bicycle, or university shuttle access.  Off-campus housing tends to offer more relaxed rules and regulations than on-campus housing, resulting in off-campus housing being generally more appealing to upper-classmen.  We believe that the support of colleges and universities can be beneficial to the success of our owned properties.  We actively seek to have these institutions recommend our facilities to their students or to provide us with mailing lists so that we may directly market to students and parents.  In some cases, the institutions actually promote our off-campus facilities in their recruiting and admissions literature.  In cases where the educational institutions do not provide mailing lists or recommendations for off-campus housing, most provide comprehensive lists of suitable properties to their students, and we continually work to ensure that our properties are on these lists in each of the markets that we serve.
Off-campus housing is subject to competition for tenants with on-campus housing owned by colleges and universities, and vice versa.  Colleges and universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates than us (and other private sector operators), thereby decreasing their operating costs.  Residence halls owned and operated by the primary colleges and universities in the markets of our off-campus properties may charge lower rental rates, but typically offer fewer amenities than we offer at our properties.  Additionally, most universities are only able to house a small percentage of their overall enrollment and are therefore highly dependent upon the off-campus market to provide housing for their students.  High-quality, well run off-campus student housing can be a critical component to an institution’s ability to attract and retain students.  Therefore, developing and maintaining good relationships with educational institutions can result in a privately owned off-campus facility becoming, in effect, an extension of the institution’s housing program, with the institution providing highly valued references and recommendations to students and parents.
This segment also competes with national and regional owner-operators of off-campus student housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner-operators.  Therefore, the performance of this segment could be affected by the construction of new on-campus or off-campus residences, increases or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing communities, increases or decreases in the number of students enrolled at one or more of the colleges or universities in the market of a property, and other general economic conditions.

American Campus Equity ("ACE®"): Included in our owned properties segment and branded and marketed to colleges and universities as the ACE® program, this transaction structure provides us with what we believe is a lower-risk opportunity compared to off-campus projects, as our ACE® projects have premier on-campus locations with marketing and operational assistance from the university.  The subject university substantially benefits by increasing its housing capacity with modern, well-amenitized student housing with no or minimal impacts to its own credit ratios, preserving the university’s credit capacity to fund academic and research facilities.
We have expanded our ACE® program to include the development of a ten-phase purpose-built housing project serving student interns participating in the highly competitive Disney College Program (“Disney College Program” or “DCP”). This project offers natural synergies with our other ACE® projects and exploits our core competency of housing college students.  The $614.6 million living-learning community includes ACC-designed units offering a variety of configurations and price points providing privacy and individuality for college student participants. The development also includes a centralized 25,000-square-foot Disney Education Center located on site, offering college accredited coursework allowing participants to earn credit hours transferable to their respective universities. As of December 31, 2021, we have completed construction on six phases of the project within the targeted delivery timeline, and the remaining phases are anticipated to be delivered in 2022 and 2023.
On-Campus Participating Properties: Our On-Campus Participating Properties ("OCPPs") segment includes six on-campus properties that are operated under long-term ground/facility leases with three university systems. Under our ground/facility leases, we receive an annual distribution representing 50% of these properties’ net cash flows, as defined in the ground/facility lease agreements.  We also manage these properties under long-term management agreements and are paid management fees equal to a percentage of defined gross receipts.
Our on-campus participating properties are susceptible to some of the same risks as our owned properties, including: (i) seasonality in rents; (ii) annual re-leasing that is highly dependent on marketing and university admission policies; and (iii) competition for tenants from other on-campus housing operated by educational institutions or other off-campus properties.
Third-Party Services
Our third-party services consist of development services and management services and are typically provided to university and college clients.  Fee revenue earned from this business segment allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities. We believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties. While management evaluates the operational performance of our third-party services based on the distinct segments identified below, at times we also evaluate these segments on a combined basis.
Development Services: Our Development Services segment consists of development and construction management services that we provide through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c)3 foundations, and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education.  These services range from short-term consulting projects to long-term, full-scale development and construction projects.  We typically provide these services to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus student housing properties, and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening.  They look to us to bring our student housing experience and expertise to ensure they develop marketable, functional, and financially sustainable facilities.  Educational institutions usually seek to build housing that will enhance their recruitment and retention of students while facilitating their academic objectives.  Most of these development service contracts are awarded via a competitive request for proposal (“RFP”) process that qualifies developers based on their overall capability to provide specialized student housing design, development, construction management, financial structuring, and property management services.  Our development services typically include pre-development, design, and financial structuring services.  Our pre-development services typically include feasibility studies for third-party owners and design services.  Feasibility studies include an initial feasibility analysis, review of conceptual design, and assistance with master planning.  Some of the documents produced in this process include the conceptual design documents, preliminary development and operating budgets, cash flow projections, and a preliminary market assessment.  Our design services include coordination with the architect and other members of the design team, review of construction plans, and assistance with project due diligence and project budgets.
Construction management services typically consist of hiring project professionals and a general contractor, coordinating and supervising the construction, equipping and furnishing the property, site visits, and full coordination and administration of all activities necessary for project completion in accordance with plans and specifications and with verification of adequate insurance.
Our Development Services activities benefit our primary goal of owning and operating student housing properties in a number of ways.  By providing these services to others, we are able to expand and refine our unit plan and community design, the operational efficiency of our material specifications, and our ability to determine market acceptance of unit and community amenities.  Our development and construction management personnel enable us to establish relationships with general contractors, architects, and project professionals throughout the nation.  Through these services, we gain experience and expertise in residential and commercial construction methodologies under various labor conditions, including right-to-work labor markets, markets subject to prevailing wage requirements, and fully unionized environments.  This segment is subject to competition from other specialized student housing development companies as well as from national real estate development companies.
Property Management Services: Our Property Management Services segment includes revenues generated from third-party management contracts in which we are typically responsible for all aspects of operations, including marketing, leasing administration, facilities maintenance, business administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial reporting, capital projects, and residence life student development.  We provide these services pursuant to management agreements that have initial terms that range from one to five years.
There are several housing options that compete with our third-party managed properties including, but not limited to, multifamily housing, for-rent single family dwellings, other off-campus specialized student housing, and the aforementioned on-campus participating properties. We also compete with other regional and national providers of third-party management services.
Americans with Disabilities Act and Federal Fair Housing Act
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in the laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.  Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we intend to continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Under the federal and state fair housing laws, discrimination on the basis of certain protected classes is prohibited.  Violation of these laws can result in significant damage awards to victims.
Our Commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Factors
Corporate responsibility is fundamental to the Company’s mission to consistently provide every resident and team member with an environment conducive to healthy living, personal growth, academic achievement, and professional success. This mission drives our ESG vision of creating healthy, sustainable environments with a sense of community and connection by giving back, investing in our employees, and driving long-term value for all stakeholders. 
In 2021, we employed significant internal resources towards our ESG efforts, including appointing a new Executive Vice President and Chief Purpose and Inclusion Officer, Senior Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, and Director of ESG. We also have a multi-functional ESG Committee and Diversity and Inclusion Task Force to support and enhance our programs and goals and to ensure we execute on our ESG strategy. We regularly review our ESG initiatives with our Board of Directors, and maintain communication with ESG-focused stakeholders. Additional information regarding the Company’s ESG initiatives, including a Letter of Commitment to ESG, may be found online at ESG.AmericanCampus.com. The information contained on our website, including the Letter of Commitment to ESG, is not a part of or incorporated into this report.
Environmental Matters

Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in its property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances.  The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to rent or sell the property or use the property as collateral.  Independent environmental consultants conducted environmental site assessments on all acquired or developed owned properties and on-campus participating properties in our existing portfolio.  We are not aware of any environmental conditions that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  There is no assurance, however, that environmental site assessments or other investigations would reveal all environmental conditions or that environmental conditions not known to us may exist now or in the future which would result in liability to the Company for remediation or fines, either under existing laws and regulations or future changes to such requirements.

From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, designates certain sites affected by hazardous substances as “Superfund” sites pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA.  Superfund sites can cover large areas, affecting many different parcels of land.  Although CERCLA imposes joint and several liability for contamination on property owners and operators regardless of fault, the EPA may choose to pursue potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) based on their actual contribution to the contamination.  PRPs are liable for the costs of responding to the hazardous substances.  Each of Villas on Apache (disposed of in April 2011), The Village on University (disposed of in December 2006), and University Village at San Bernardino (disposed of in January 2005) are located within federal Superfund sites.  The EPA designated these areas as Superfund sites because groundwater underneath these areas is contaminated.  We have not been named, and do not expect to be named, as a PRP with respect to these sites.  However, there can be no assurance regarding potential future developments concerning such sites.
Insurance
Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, liability, and workers’ compensation.  We believe that our insurance coverages are of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets.  We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future.  However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods or earthquakes, which may be subject to limitations in certain areas.  When not otherwise contractually stipulated, we exercise our judgment in determining amounts, coverage limits, and deductibles, in an effort to maintain appropriate levels of insurance on our investments.  If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient due to market conditions at the time or other unforeseen factors.  Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,006 employees, consisting of 371 corporate employees and 2,635 employees at our owned, managed, and on-campus participating properties.
Purpose and Culture: Our Company values are centered around people. We care deeply about our residents. Serving students well requires engaged, passionate, and diverse team members, so we’ve created an award-winning culture that fosters growth and rewards achievement. Service is also deeply embedded into our culture: we give back to the communities in which we live and work.
In 2020, we earned a Great Places to Work™ certification with a total of 97% of the employees surveyed saying ACC is a great place to work. Our employee compensation and benefits packages are designed to competitively compensate all employees for their contributions, and our Culture Committee conducts regular internal communications, volunteer events, and activities that help to ensure we are attracting and retaining employees that share our passion. Our employees are not represented by a labor union.
Employee Engagement: In addition to promoting a leadership culture with an open-door policy for all employees, ACC seeks to regularly engage with employees to promote communication and solicit valuable feedback on our efforts to create a healthy and meaningful work culture. We annually survey our employees regarding their satisfaction and views on the ACC workplace environment. We also regularly publish newsletters for both our corporate and property employees that welcome new team members, highlight employee advancements and accomplishments, celebrate life events, discuss operational best practices, and 
promote Company milestones, achievements, and initiatives. Our CEO also hosts “Bill’s Quarterly Call” where employee achievements are highlighted and any employee can ask questions regarding the Company’s direction and the state of the industry.
Community and Social Impact: Our definition of “community” goes beyond our communities. We support youth in need with a focus on education through our charitable foundation, as well as encourage volunteerism by our corporate and property staff. For us, giving back means being good corporate citizens and making a positive difference for those in need. We encourage our employees and our properties to be involved in their communities and are proud of the vast varieties of philanthropic causes our employees and residents champion.
In alignment with our Core Value, “Give Back,” and in connection with the December 2021 closing of a joint venture transaction including properties in our Arizona State University (“ASU”) portfolio, we made a commitment to donate $5.0 million to ASU for scholarships, programs that support student success, and sustainability.
We are also proud to support the mental health of both our employees and residents by expanding our long-term partnership with the Hi, How Are You Project (“HHAY”) and our continued staff training on peer-to-peer support at more than 200 communities across the country. As a part of our partnership with HHAY, we published a College Student Fall 2021 Mental Wellness Survey Report in November 2021 that included responses from approximately 9,000 college students who shared insights into their own current mental health state and overall wellbeing.
Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”): We strive to have an inclusive culture where all know their unique voices will be valued. ACC’s founding vision states, “Our people are our strength, achieving success through a dedication to excellence and integrity.” Our people are devoted to a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equality in the workplace and our communities. Our Company and our student communities are defined and strengthened by the belief that every individual and their experience adds value and enhances our position as an industry leader and university partner. We take responsibility to intentionally execute an evolving set of goals specific to inclusion, diversity, and accountability, driven by empathetic leadership and embraced by all.
We are proud that our ACC team represents the diversity of the residents and communities we serve, as more than half of our team members are minorities and half are female. In addition, we are overseen by a Board of Directors, more than a third of whose members are diverse by race or gender. In 2021, our female and minority representation at the executive level increased with the appointment of our Chief Purpose and Inclusion Officer, who oversees our ESG efforts including our diversity and inclusion initiatives.
We have a Code of Conduct for employees that includes policies on diversity, inclusion, and antidiscrimination. Additionally, ACC is a signatory for the CEO Impact Pledge to further diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 
In 2020, ACC formed a diversity and inclusion task force to oversee the execution of our goals over the long term. Since then, we have engaged a third-party consultant to review our employment program with a focus on diversity and inclusion criteria, including vision, goals, statement, and Company demographic breakdown. We also conducted consultant-facilitated “Unconscious Bias/Business Training” for ACC employees at the level of vice president and above, and are developing D&I training curricula for all employees and supervisors.
ACC has worked with our partners at Prairie View A&M University (“PVAMU”), our longest-running university relationship and a Historically Black College and University (“HBCU”), to establish both a scholarship endowment fund and an annual scholarship to assist graduating seniors. In the interest of promoting more diversity in the field of architecture, we have also created a specific scholarship geared towards architecture students at PVAMU.
In an effort to attract and support disadvantaged and underrepresented business owners, we developed a neighborhood small business nurturing program for local retailers in our owned property portfolio. The pilot program at LightView in Boston was the genesis of the September 2021 opening of the Underground Café, a female and minority owned establishment that brings together food, art, culture, and community.
Safety: We have a comprehensive Safety Plan that includes safety-related work practices that apply to our student housing communities. We also require service contract agreements, which mandate that all contractors and subcontractors that perform work in facilities or on property controlled by ACC abide by all safety rules and follow safety procedures.
Training and Professional Development: We believe that in order to be successful and satisfied in their jobs, employees must have the training necessary to further their effectiveness and assist in career advancement and retention. Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions.
We’ve built a comprehensive employee development program with opportunities at every career stage. We connect employees with plans tailored to their goals and offer a range of trainings, mentoring, and conferences through ACC University and other programs. Employees are auto-enrolled for the appropriate courses when they are hired for or promoted into new positions. In addition to our training designed to address regulatory and statutory matters (antiharassment, cybersecurity, data privacy, etc.), our ACC University offers a catalog of more than 800 on-demand training courses.
Our Inside Track program provides top-performing, on-site team members with the development needed to become General Managers. Inside Track consists of an intensive training program and a four-month mentoring program emphasizing residence life, human resource management, business operations, marketing and leasing, facilities, and career development. In addition, ACC hosts several other employee development conferences including our annual Leadership Conference, Inside Track: Facilities and ACCelerate. We also provide numerous live training webinars that educate on current management issues and promote internal networking.
