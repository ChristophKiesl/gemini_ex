  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
  Loop Industries is a technology company whose mission is to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable PET plastic and polyester fiber and away from our dependence on fossil fuels. Loop Industries owns patented and proprietary technology that depolymerizes no and low-value waste PET plastic and polyester fiber, including plastic bottles and packaging, carpets and textiles of any color, transparency or condition and even ocean plastics that have been degraded by the sun and salt, to its base building blocks (monomers). The monomers are filtered, purified and polymerized to create virgin-quality Loop™ branded PET resin suitable for use in food-grade packaging and polyester fiber, thus enabling our customers to meet their sustainability objectives. Loop Industries is contributing to the global movement towards a circular economy by reducing plastic waste and recovering waste plastic for a sustainable future.
 Industry Background and Market Opportunity
  
  The global annual market demand for PET plastic and polyester fiber at nearly $130 billion per year, and the current growth projections from the 2018 IHS Polymer Market Report indicate this will exceed $160 billion by 2022.
  
  We believe, plastic pollution continues to be one of the most persistently covered environmental issues by media and local and global environmental non-governmental organizations. Some of the main concerns associated with PET are the emissions associated with its production from non-renewable hydrocarbons and the length of time it persists in landfills and the natural environment. There is an increasing demand for action to address the global plastic crisis, which has been characterized by facts provided by leading academic and not-for profit organizations. In the last few years, governments in North America and Europe have been enacting and proposing laws and regulations mandating the use of minimum recycled content in packaging underlying the strength of this issue in the marketplace. Consumer brands are seeking a solution to their plastic challenge, and they are taking action. In recent years we have seen major brands make significant commitments to close the loop on their plastic packaging by transitioning their packaging to recyclable materials and by incorporating more recycled content into their packaging.

  Global consumer goods companies, apparel manufacturers, and retail brands have announced significant public commitments and targets to make the transition to a circular plastic economy, namely:
  
   ●
 In January 2018, Danone’s evian® brand bottled spring water committed to a 100% recycled content package by 2025;

   ●
 In 2018, Coca-Cola committed to an average recycled content of 50% across its packaging by 2030;

   ●
 In October 2018, PepsiCo committed to use an average of 25% recycled plastic in its packaging by 2025, PepsiCo is also aiming to use 50% recycled plastic in its bottles across the European Union by 2030;

   ●
 In 2020, L’OCCITANE en Provence committed to 100% recycled content plastic in their bottles by 2025;

   ●
 In 2020, L’Oréal Group committed to using 100% recycled or biobased plastic in their packaging by 2030;

   ●
 By 2025, Unilever targets increasing the use of post-consumer recycled plastic material in their packaging to at least 25%;

   ●
 Colgate-Palmolive states a 2025 goal of increasing recycled content for plastic to 25%;

   ●
 Nestlé aims to increase the amount of recycled PET used across their brands globally to 50% by 2025;

   ●
 Adidas Group aims to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all adidas and Reebok products where a solution exists by 2024;

   ●
 H&M is aiming to use 30% recycled material by 2025 (based on their 2018 usage as baseline) and ensuring that at least 25% of the plastic they use in packaging is from recycled content;

   ●
 Walmart has an objective to use at least 17% post-consumer recycled content globally in their private brand plastic packaging and is taking action to eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use towards reuse models where relevant by 2025; and

   ●
 Ikea’s ambition is, that by 2030, all plastic used in their products will be based on renewable or recycled material.

 
 There is a growing regulatory and policy environment to encourage a reduction in the production of virgin fossil fuel based plastic and for minimum recycled content in packaging imposed by various governments. For example, on July 21 2020, the European Union announced a new tax on plastic waste starting January 1, 2021. This tax will have a rate of €800/ton on nonrecycled plastic packaging. In the UK, a new £200/ton tax will apply to plastic packaging produced or imported into the UK that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic, effective 2022. A California law filed on September 24, 2020 requires that plastic bottles contain at least 15% post consumer resin by 2022, 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. The growing regulatory environment is expected to increase the demand for recycled PET plastic further.
  
  As explained by the International Bottled Water Association, currently, mechanical recycled PET (rPET) plastic is produced principally through the conversion of bales of PET bottles. The materials have been collected and transported to a materials recovery facility (“MRF”), where they are sorted from other materials, baled, and sent to specific PET recycling facilities. The bales are broken and sorted to remove any non-PET materials. The PET is then ground and put through a separation process which separates the PET from the bottle cap and label materials. Clean PET flake is then further processed depending on its intended end market. It may become more highly refined PET pellet for new bottles or extruded into PET sheet for clamshells, trays, and cups. Recycled PET is also spun into fiber for carpet, clothing, fiber fill, or other materials. We believe mechanically recycled PET has a number of challenges in meeting the quality specifications and growing volume requirements implied by commitments from major brands, mainly due to the cost and variety of acceptable PET feedstock.
  
  Some mechanical recycling processes involve remelting the PET flake which reduces the quality of the rPET output each time it is recycled relative to the specifications of virgin PET produced from fossil fuels. Each time the PET plastic is mechanically recycled, its quality and clarity are reduced. Therefore, mechanically recycled PET may need to be mixed with virgin PET from fossil fuels to maintain quality. Lower quality mechanically recycled PET is often downcycled to alternate uses such as polyester fibers which may be dyed and used in carpets or clothing. Additionally, mechanically recycled PET manufactured for use in clear bottles or food containers requires predominently clear and clean PET flakes separated from waste bales, and cannot accommodate darkly colored PET flakes, lower quality fiber feedstock, or materially contaminated feedstock, which may be cheaper.
  
  We believe the commercialization plans of Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber may provide the ideal solution for global brands because Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber contains 100% recycled PET and polyester fiber content. The Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber is virgin quality suitable for use in food-grade packaging. That means consumer packaged goods companies will be able to choose to market packaging made from a 100% Loop™ branded PET resin and polyester fiber.

  Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
  We believe, the power of our technology lies in its ability to use post-industrial and post-consumer waste PET plastic and polyester fiber feedstocks, which could end up in landfills, rivers, oceans and natural areas, to create Loop™ PET resin. We believe our technology can deliver high-purity profitable virgin quality PET resin suitable for use in food-grade packaging and polyester fiber.
 
  Our Generation I technology (“GEN I”) is a hydrolysis-based depolymerization technology which yielded purified terephthalic acid (“PTA”) and monoethylene glycol (“MEG”), two common monomers of PET. As the Company evaluated the transition from the GEN I technology from pilot scale to commercial scale, several challenges involving PTA and MEG purification were identified. To overcome the GEN I technology challenges, we embarked on the development of a second generation of our technology. Our Generation II technology (“GEN II”) is a methanolysis-based depolymerization technology that uses temperatures below 90 °C to depolymerize waste PET and polyester fiber. The low temperature offers several key advantages which the company believes will improve its ability to commercialize the GEN II technology, including;
  
   ●
 Lower energy usage during depolymerization and therefore reduced processing cost relative to higher temperature processes;

   ●
 Avoidance of side reactions with non-PET waste, which are inherent in waste PET feedstock streams, during depolymerization which may occur during higher temperature and higher pressure depolymerization processes. This allows for a simplified distillation purification process resulting in less, and more effective, steps to isolate the desired high purity DMT and MEG monomers suitable to produce virgin quality PET required to meet food contact regulations as well as the quality and clarity requirements of global consumer product companies;

   ●
 Allowing the depolymerization of less costly and low-quality feedstocks, which cannot be effectively recycled today, such as carpet fiber, clothing and mixed plastics, and upcycling them into high quality PET that can used in food contact use; and

   ●
 The GEN II technology uses only trace amounts of water, eliminates the need for a halogenated solvent and uses a catalyst at low concentration.


  This shift, from producing the monomer PTA to the monomer DMT, was a pivotal moment for Loop Industries. We believe that GEN II requires less energy and fewer resource inputs than conventional PET production processes. We also believe it is an environmentally sustainable method for producing virgin quality food-grade PET plastic by decoupling PET manufacturing from the fossil fuel industry.
 
 To independently validate that our GEN II technology can produce DMT and MEG monomers at mini-pilot and pilot scale, we commissioned Kemitek, a College Centre for Technology Transfer specialized in the fields of green chemistry and chemical process scale-up. Kemitek’s findings allowed them to confirm that our technology produces monomers that meet our purity specifications for the production of PET resin and polyester fiber. The complete, Kemitek report was filed with the SEC by the Company on December 14, 2020.
 
  To protect our technology, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and provisions as well as other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our patents, brand names, product designs and marks, We have two technology areas, referred to as GEN I technology and the GEN II technology, with patent claims relating to our technology for depolymerizing PET.
 
   ●
 The GEN I technology portfolio has three issued U.S. patents, all expected to expire on or around July 2035. Internationally, we also have issued patents in Argentina, Australia, Europe, Eurasia, Israel, Taiwan, South Africa, and in the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, allowed patent applications in China and Japan, and pending patent applications in Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Mexico, and the Philippines, all expected to expire, if granted, on or around July 2036, not including any patent term extension.

   ●
 The GEN II technology portfolio currently consists of four patent families:


   o
 The first has two issued U.S. patent and a pending U.S. application, all expected to expire on or around September 2037. Internationally, we also have an issued patent in Bangladesh, and pending applications in Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Bhutan, Canada, China, Columbia, Eurasia, Europe, members of the Gulf Countries, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Iraq, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Laos, Mexico, Malaysia, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Pakistan, Singapore, Taiwan, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and South Africa, all expected to expire on or around September 2038, if granted and not including any patent term extension.


   o
 An additional aspect of the GEN II technology is claimed in an issued U.S. patent and a pending U.S. application. Internationally, we also have an allowed patent application in Bangladesh and pending applications in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Eurasia, Egypt, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Iran, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, all expected to expire on or around June 2039, if granted and not including any patent term extension.


   o
 A further additional aspect of the GEN II technology is the subject of a U.S. application and an International application. Any patents that would ultimately grant from these applications would be expected to expire on or around March 2040, not including any patent term extension.


   o
 Another further additional aspect of the GEN II technology is the subject of a U.S. application, an International application, and pending applications in Argentina, Bolivia, Bangladesh, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Uruguay. Any patents that would ultimately grant from these applications would be expected to expire on or around March 2040, not including any patent term extension.


Loop owns registrations for its trademarks in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Loop also has pending applications in Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Taiwan, the U.S., and Vietnam.
  
 
  Government Regulation and Approvals
  
  As we seek to further develop and commercialize our technology, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Compliance with current and future regulations, including food packaging regulations, could increase our operational costs.
 
  Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits and approvals for the operation of our business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Additionally, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience delays in obtaining such permits or approvals. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties. See “Risk Factors” below for additional information.
 
  We believe that if we are successful in addressing food packaging regulations in various countries and economic regions, that the regulatory environment may provide Loop™ PET resin a competive advantage relative to mechanically recycled alternative resins and virgin PET.
  
 We received a no-objection letter (NOL) on March 1, 2021 from the US Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to confirm the capability of Loop Industries’ tertiary recycling process, known as methanolysis, in cleaning and producing post-industrial and post-consumer recycled PET for use in the manufacture of food-contact articles that contact all food types all conditions of use for which PET is permitted. The request to the FDA was initiated on November 23, 2020 and the NOL grant was provided within the expected response period of three to six months.
   
 We have received from the European Chemicals Agency a confirmation of registration for our MEG on November 17, 2020, and for our DMT on December 7, 2020. The registration under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation (EC 1907/2006) confirms that our monomers are of a purity equal to what is currently recognized within Europe and entitles us to manufacture/import the monomers into Europe. It should be noted that MEG and DMT are on the positive list for plastic materials, which means that the two monomers can be used as food contact materials.
  
 The levels of monomer purity confirmed by Kemitek’s verification are in line with the data submitted for the REACH registration of our DMT and MEG monomers and additionally support the March 1, 2021 NOL from the FDA.

  Supply Agreements with Global Consumer Brands
  
 Consumer brands are seeking a solution to their plastic challenge and they are taking bold action. In the past years, we have seen major brands make significant commitments to close the loop on their plastic use in two ways; by transitioning their packaging to recyclable materials and by incorporating more recycled content into their packaging. We believe Loop™ PET resin provides the ideal solution for these brands because it is recyclable and is made from 100% recycled PET waste and polyester fiber, while being virgin-quality and suitable for use in food-grade packaging and polyester fiber.
  
 We believe that due to the commitments by large global consumer brands to incorporate more recycled content into their product packaging, the regulatory requirements for minimum recycled content in packaging imposed by governments, the virgin-quality of Loop™ branded PET resin and its marketability to extoll the sustainability credentials of consumer brands that incorporate it, we believe we will be able to sell Loop™ branded PET resin at a premium price relative to virgin and mechanically recycled PET resin.
  
  We are pursuing supply agreements with customers that are located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We currently have agreements with some of the world’s leading brands to be supplied from our planned commercial facility from our joint venture with Indorama Ventures Holdings LP (“Indorama”) in Spartanburg, South Carolina, including:
  
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with Danone SA, one of the world’s leading global food and beverage companies. Danone will purchase 100% sustainable and upcycled Loop™ branded PET for use in brands across its portfolio including evian®, Danone’s iconic natural spring water;

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with PepsiCo, one of the largest purchasers of recycled PET plastic, enabling PepsiCo to purchase production capacity and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging;

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with L’OCCITANE en Provence to supply 100% recycled and sustainable Loop™ PET resin and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging; and

 
   ●
 Multi-year supply agreement with L’Oréal Group, the global leader in the beauty industry, enabling L’Oréal Group to purchase production capacity and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging.

 
  Turning PET Waste into Feedstock
  
 We use waste PET plastic and polyester fiber as feedstock. Our technology can use PET plastic bottles and packaging of any color, transparency or condition, carpet, clothing and other polyester textiles that may contain colors, dyes or additives, and even PET plastics that have been recovered from the ocean and degraded by exposure to sun and salt. We believe that our ability to use many materials that mechanical recyclers cannot use is an important advantage of Loop™ PET resin over mechanically recycled PET resin. This also means we are creating a new market for materials that have persistently been leaking out of the waste management system and into our shared rivers, oceans and natural areas.

  Commercialization Plan and Progress
  
 During the year ended February 28, 2021, we continued executing our corporate strategy with a focus on the commercialization of our technology. We are progressing on the engineering of our full-scale commercial facilities with our engineering partner Worley, a leading global engineering, procurement and construction company. The engineering philosophy we have adopted is design one, build many. This approach allows for the process design package, which has been completed, to be used as the base engineering platform for all future geographical expansion. We believe this approach allows for a quick execution, speed to market and lends itself well to modular construction.
  
 The Infinite LoopTM manufacturing technology is the key pillar of our commercialization blueprint. We believe our technology is at the forefront of the global transition away from fossil fuels and petrochemicals and into the circular economy, where PET plastic and polyester fiber are produced from recycled content. The Infinite Loop™ technology is being engineered to support the commitment of global consumer brands to achieve a high level of recycled content in packaging. Infinite Loop™ facilities could be located near large urban centers where more plastic is being consumed and therefore more waste plastic feedstock is likely available.
  
 Our objective is to achieve global expansion of the technology through a mix of fully owned facilities, strategic partnerships, and licensing agreements. We believe that industrial companies, some of which today may not be in the business of manufacturing PET resin or polyester fiber, will view involvement in Infinite Loop™ projects as a growth opportunity, which may offer attractive economic returns either as Loop manufacturing partners or as licensees of the technology.
  
 On September 2, 2020, we entered into a know-how and engineering agreement (the “Chemtex Agreement”) with Chemtex Global Corporation (“Chemtex”) to license the PET resin and polyester fiber manufacturing know-how of INVISTA’s technology and licensing group, INVISTA Performance Technologies (IPT) (“INVISTA”). The INVISTA know how will be used for the polymerization of DMT and MEG monomer output from Loop’s depolymerization technology, the result of which is LoopTM PET resin or polyester fiber made from 100% recycled content. The INVISTA polymerization process and the associated designs are historically proven in the commercial production of PET resin and polyester fiber.
  
 We continue to focus on the completion of the Infinite LoopTM engineering design with an intial target capacity of up to 70,000 metric tons/year. Permitting, site and regulatory considerations may impact plant capacity for the various projects. The design includes the integration of our depolymerization technology with INVISTA’s polymerization technology in partnership with Worley. We intend to use this design when evaluating Infinite LoopTM facilities in various regions. Worley has completed the pre-feasibility engineering as part of the planning phase for an Infinite LoopTM manufacturing facility in the province of Québec. We expect that Worley may also play a role in the feasibility phase of engineering and the future design of larger capacity facilities.
  
 We believe that Infinite LoopTM recycled PET resin and polyester fiber would command premium pricing over virgin, petroleum-based PET resin and provide attractive economic returns. We are targeting multi-year take or pay offtake agreements for planned Infinite LoopTM production. Factors under consideration in determining project economics include pre-feasibility design engineering and cost estimate work, timing and permitting of a facility, customer offtake demand, commitment terms, and feedstock sources, quality, availability, logistics, and ramp up, among others.
  
  Infinite LoopTM Bécancour, Québec
  
 We are in the planning phase for an Infinite LoopTM manufacturing facility in the province of Québec (the “Québec Project”). On May 27, 2021, we acquired a 19 million square foot parcel of land in Bécancour, Québec for $4.8 million (CDN $5.9 million) (the “New Site”). The site offers attractive logistics being located on the St-Lawrence river and access to rail. As previously disclosed, we had identified a different 2 million square feet parcel of land in Bécancour, Québec (the “Previous Site”), and had negotiated an option right to purchase that parcel of land. The environmental impact of building on the New Site is lower than the Previous Site because we will be recycling an industrial site that has previously been demolished. The development of this site will likely not result in the destruction of wetlands or forest and it reduces the overall construction costs and permitting time. The site size exceeds our project needs and we may choose to sell a portion of the land to offset part of our project commitment. We will not exercise the purchase option which was agreed in January 2021 to acquire the Previous Site and we will cease monthly payments for the option rights of the Previous Site.

 The Québec Project is currently contemplated as wholly-owned and operated by Loop Industries which allows us to commercialize near our Innovation and Engineering teams located in Terrebonne, Québec. To fund the project and enhance our target returns, we are exploring financing options. Alternatives under exploration include incentive and financing programs supported by, or in partnership with, various levels of government.
  
 The Québec Project would allow the Company to proceed with Infinite LoopTM commercialization in a more expeditious manner without being impacted by COVID-19 restrictions on international travel.
  
  Infinite LoopTM Europe
  
 We announced on September 10, 2020 a strategic partnership with SUEZ GROUP (“Suez”), with the objective to build the first Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility in Europe. With the combination of the Infinite LoopTM technology and the resource management expertise of Suez, this partnership seeks to respond to growth in demand in Europe from global beverage and consumer goods brand companies who we believe are committed to ambitious targets for a high level of recycled content in their products. Together with Suez, we have initiated the work to enable us to make a final investment decision for the project with the current priorities being on the site selection, permitting, and feedstock requirements and engineering. We are targeting final site selection during the summer of 2021.
 Joint Venture with Indorama
  
 In September 2018 we announced a joint venture with Indorama to retrofit their existing PET manufacturing facilities. The joint venture was formed with the objective to manufacture and commercialize sustainable Loop™ PET resin to meet the growing global demand from beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. This partnership brings together Indorama’s manufacturing footprint and Loop Industries’ proprietary technology to become a supplier of 100% sustainable and recycled PET resin.
  
 We entered into a joint venture agreement (“Joint Venture Agreement”) with Indorama through our wholly-owned subsidiary Loop Innovations, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Each company has 50/50 equity interest in the joint venture. We are contributing to the 50/50 joint venture an exclusive world-wide royalty-free license to use its proprietary technology to produce 100% sustainably produced PET resin in addition to our equity cash contribution. The Joint Venture Agreement details the establishment of an initial 20,700 metric tons per year facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in the southeastern United States. In 2019, the joint venture decided to increase the capacity of the planned Spartanburg plant due to customer demand to 40,000 metric tons per year.
  
  We have currently contracted for the sale of approximately 40% of the planned capacity, of the expected output of the Spartanburg facility and we will resume discussions for the remaining volume once we have more visibility on the commissioning date of the facility, although we have had and may continue to experience delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see “The global COVID-19 pandemic” as noted under “Risk Factors”). As part of the Joint Venture Agreement, we are committed to contribute our equity share for the costs under the joint venture agreement to construct the facility. During the year ended February 28, 2021, we made a contribution of $650,000 and as at February 28, 2021, we have contributed a total of $1,500,000 to the joint venture.
  
  The joint venture made a decision over the summer of 2020 that due to the COVID-19 pandemic it would temporarily delay work on the project. Since then, no expenditures have been incurred by the joint venture. The travel restrictions and quarantine requirements between Canada and the US continued to cause disruptions in our timetable. While both joint venture partners currently remain committed to the project, we continue to monitor the COVID-19 implications on the project timetable.
  
  Demonstration Plant and Innovation Center in Terrebonne, Québec
  
 As part of our plan for the commercialization of future Infinite LoopTM manufacturing facilities, we decided to convert our Terrebonne, Québec pilot plant to an Infinite LoopTM demonstration and training facility. This demonstration facility will be used to showcase the Infinite LoopTM end to end technology to potential partners and customers, and train operational teams in advance of the commissioning of commercial plants.
  
  
9


 
 
 We made significant investments in the demonstration plant during the year ended February 28, 2021. In particular, we installed and began operation of two new depolymerization reactors in the last quarter. The depolymerization reactors substantially increase our demonstration facility’s depolymerization capacity and confirm the design and scale-up factor for the feasibility engineering of the planned commercial-scale facilities. In addition, we have also entered into an agreement to acquire PET polymerization equipment from Chemtex to manufacture of Loop™ branded PET resin at our demonstration plant. We anticipate the Infinite LoopTM demonstration plant project to be largely completed by late in calendar 2021 and delivering Loop™ branded PET resin to customers starting in calendar 2022.
  
 In addition to the capital requirements for our commercialization, we plan to continue to invest in strengthening our intellectual property portfolio, building a core competency in managing strategic relationships and continue enhancing our brand value. Our research and development innovation center in Terrebonne, Québec will continue to push forward the development of our technology.

  Corporate History
  
 We were originally incorporated in Nevada in March 2010 under the name Radikal Phones Inc., which was changed to First American Group Inc. in October 2010. On June 29, 2015, we completed a reverse acquisition of Loop Holdings, Inc. (“Loop Holdings”) whereby we acquired all of Loop Holdings’ issued and outstanding shares of common stock in a share exchange for approximately 78.1% of our capital stock at the time. The depolymerization business of Loop Holdings became our sole operating business. On June 22, 2015, our board of directors approved a change in the fiscal year end date from September 30 to the last day of February. On July 21, 2015, we changed our name to Loop Industries, Inc.

 Loop Holdings was originally incorporated in Nevada on October 23, 2014. The depolymerization technology underlying our business was originally developed by Hatem Essaddam who sold the technology and related intellectual property rights to Loop Holdings in October 2014, pursuant to an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement dated October 27, 2014, by and among Hatem Essaddam, Loop Holdings, and Daniel Solomita. The intellectual property acquired pursuant to such Intellectual Property Agreement formed the basis for establishing the GEN I technology that was initially used by us. The GEN I technology has now been superseded by the development of our GEN II technology, which forms the basis for our commercialization into the future. We do not intend to commercialize our GEN I technology.
  
 On May 24, 2016, 9449507 Canada Inc. was organized under the federal laws of Canada and on November 11, 2016 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loop Industries, Inc. following the transfer by Mr. Solomita of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 9449507 Canada Inc. to Loop Industries, Inc. On December 23, 2016, 9449507 Canada Inc. changed its legal name to Loop Canada Inc.
  
 On December 31, 2016, 8198381 Canada Inc. entered into a purchase and sale agreement to transfer to Loop Canada Inc., all assets and liabilities it held pertaining to our business of depolymerizing plastics, including employees and operations.
  
 On March 9, 2017, Loop Holdings, our wholly-owned subsidiary, merged with and into Loop Industries, Inc., with Loop Industries, Inc. being the surviving entity as a result of the merger.
  
 On November 20, 2017, Loop Industries, Inc. commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under its new trading symbol, “LOOP.” From April 10, 2017 to November 19, 2017, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQX tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol “LLPP.” From October 29, 2015 through April 7, 2017, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the stock symbol “LLPP.” From September 26, 2012 to October 28, 2015, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the stock symbol “FAMG.”
