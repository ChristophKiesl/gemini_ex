ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We operate a global network of professionally run content houses, each of which has its own brand, influencer cohort and production capabilities. Our Company offers management, production and deal-making services to our handpicked influencers, a management division for individual influencer clients, and an investment arm for joint ventures and acquisitions for companies in the social media influencer space. Our management team consists of successful entrepreneurs with financial, legal, marketing, and digital content creation expertise.
 
Through our subsidiary, West of Hudson Group, Inc., or WOHG, we currently generate revenues primarily from talent management of social media influencers residing in our Clubhouses and for paid promotion by companies looking to utilize such social media influencers to promote their products or services. We solicit companies for potential marketing collaborations and cultivated content creation, work with the influencers and the marketing entity to negotiate and formalize a brand deal and then execute the deal and receive a certain percentage from the deal. In addition to the in-house brand deals, we generate income by providing talent management and brand partnership deals to external influencers not residing in our Clubhouses.
 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Clubhouse Media generated $1,010,405 and $0 revenues and reported net losses of $2,577,721 and $74,764, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $1,967,551 and $30,488, respectively. As noted in the consolidated financial statements of Clubhouse Media, as of December 31, 2020, Clubhouse Media had an accumulated deficit of $2,577,721. There is substantial doubt regarding the ability of Clubhouse Media to continue as going concerns as a result of their historical recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations as well as their dependence on private equity and financings. See “Risk Factors—Clubhouse Media have a history of operating losses and their management have concluded that factors raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern and the auditors of Clubhouse Media and WOHG have included explanatory paragraphs relating to their ability to continue as a going concern in their audit reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.”
 
Principal Products and Services
 
Our current principal products and services are comprised of (1) our Clubhouses (2) our talent management services and (3) our brand development and content creation.
 
The Clubhouses
 
Through WOHG, we are the sole owner of “The Clubhouse,” which is an integrated social media influencer incubator with a physical and digital footprint in Southern California and Europe. The Clubhouse is a collection of content creation houses located in scenic mansions in Southern California (three locations) and Europe (one location) that houses who we believe to be some of the most prominent and widely followed social media influencers, together carrying a currently estimated follower base of approximately 150 million social media followers as of March 10, 2021 across all Clubhouse influencers. The influencers who live in our Clubhouses, as well as the number of their social media followers, can fluctuate significantly at any given time, and we cannot predict the increase or decline of the number of influencers who live in our Clubhouses or the number of followers for our Clubhouse influencers at any given time in the future.
 
Content Houses at a Glance
 
Content houses originated from gaming houses in the gaming industry, where professional video game players and gaming teams lived in the same residence with each other in order to practice gaming and create content to build their own following. Eventually this concept was adopted by lifestyle influencers and was found to be a way for individual influencers to create new content with other influencers and grow followers together.

Our Clubhouses
 
The Clubhouse is an established network of social media content creation houses (Clubhouse BH, Just A House (“JAH”), Rozmajzl Family and Clubhouse Europe) that each provide a picturesque living environment for our band of social media influencers, complete with in-house media production teams, including photographers and videographers. We believe that this enables the influencers living at these houses to maximize the depth, breadth and scale of followers that those influencers can build across popular social media platforms.
Clubhouse BH Location
 

“Clubhouse BH” is located in the heart of Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, California and is occupied by a group of content creators who live and work together 24 hours per day and seven days per week, and are equipped with a full media team. We believe that this structure enables successful collaboration and content creation by the content-creators. Clubhouse BH is 12,000 square feet, has 11 bedrooms and sits on one acre of land. Clubhouse BH is targeting men and women aged 17 to 30.
 
“Dance Dome LA” is housed under the Clubhouse BH location that targets a subgenre of influencers in the dance community. Dance Dome aims to target the young male and female demographic of 12-30 years old specifically those interested in the subgenre of dancing related content.

Just A House Beverly Hills Location
 

“Just A House” (“JAH”) is located in the hill tops of Beverly Hills. JAH is in the process expanding its digital footprint with a young female following aimed at a demographic of women aged 12 to 30.
Republic of Malta Location
 

“Clubhouse Europe” is located in the Republic of Malta, where we’ve expanded our international footprint by bringing some of Europe’s most popular influencers together under one roof. Clubhouse Europe is targeting European demographic of men and women aged 14 to 30.

Bel-Air Location
 

“Rozmajzl Family” is a newly signed family of creators consisting of 6 daughters and their parents located in Bel Air, California. Rozmajzl Family is targeting the family-oriented demographic of men and women aged 12 to 45.
 
“The Clubhouse” Online Presence and Plans for Expansion of the Physical Clubhouses
 
While “The Clubhouse” network consists of physical locations (as described above), there are numerous “Clubhouse” accounts owned by The Clubhouse, with a combined following of over 9 million followers as of March 10, 2021 across Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and TikTok . These accounts are directly held by us (as opposed to the Clubhouse team of influencers) and therefore we have direct access to the followers of these accounts, which we consider to be our followers.
 
We are constantly surveying opportunities to establish new Clubhouses, and intend to expand our Clubhouse locations as our business continues to grow. We specifically plan on expanding the Clubhouse footprint further into Europe and the U.S., as well as into Asia, into other content niche types such as e-gaming, beauty and music. We currently intend to expand with two to four additional Clubhouses each year, depending on available funding for such expansion and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to expand at this intended rate. We also intend to engage in a cross-house collaborative strategy that we believe has not yet been established in the industry and we have talent that can be deployed to a broad range of brand partnership and other opportunities that we believe can lead to significant growth opportunities through diversified revenue streams.
 
Why We Believe that Influencers Benefit from Content Houses
 
Influencers need to constantly create original content to grow their following, and collaborations with other influencers can help facilitate creative content while allowing for sharing of followers among influencers. Our Clubhouses provide a unique living situation where influencers can collaborate and work together to grow each other’s following. For example, one of the influencers who was living in our Clubhouses experienced in four months, growth from 3.22 million followers on Instagram to 5.2 million followers on Instagram and growth from 3.4 million followers on TikTok to 6.2 million followers on TikTok. Another one of the influencers who lived in our Clubhouses experienced in four months, growth from 1.5 million followers on Instagram to 2.3 million followers on Instagram and growth from 733,000 followers on TikTok to 2.2 million followers on TikTok.

Clubhouse and Influencer Fit
 
At Clubhouse Media, we strive to cultivate a large and committed following for our team of influencers, which we plan to leverage to popularize our in-house brands, driving sales and brand-awareness to our target customers. Our approach is to create a balance between social media creativity and the business of social media marketing. We believe that this symbiotic balance creates a higher output for both our Clubhouses and influencers and creates an attractive one-stop shop for brands to advertise and for influencers to grow and collaborate. The Clubhouse’s goal is to develop and successfully monetize on its network of influencers through a portfolio of valuable brands by becoming the world’s leading hub for new media content. The Clubhouse has already received media coverage in publications such as Forbes, the New York Times, Business Insider and Seventeen, among others.
 
Agreements and Terms of Living in the Clubhouses
 
Each influencer who lives at a Clubhouse location enters into a Creator Occupancy Agreement with Doiyen, LLC (“Doiyen”), a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of out subsidiary, WOHG (“Creator Occupancy Agreement(s)”). Pursuant to the Creator Occupancy Agreements, we agree that the influencer will not be required to pay or remit any money for their occupancy in the Clubhouse, nor will be required to pay any associated utility costs associated.
 
In exchange, the influencer agrees adhere to a number terms and conditions for continued stay in the Clubhouse including, but not limited to:
 

● | Participation in branding and/or promotional endeavors, either on behalf of Clubhouse Media and our subsidiaries, or for third-party advertisers that pay Doiyen for promotion (we believe that this relationship creates what we refer to as “Free Earned Media Value”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Regular content-creation with required social media posting on various social media platforms; and 
● | Intermittent tagging and/or mentioning of The Clubhouse on the influencer’s profile and social media posts across various platforms. 

 
Through Doiyen, we retain legal ownership of the content created pursuant to each Creator Occupancy Agreement; however, the content can be shared with the influencer so that he or she can utilize it for his or her own benefit as well. Pursuant to the Creator Occupancy Agreements, we may offer influencers individual branding partnerships, including, but not limited to promotional song placements and promotional events. For all promotional partnership brought by us to the influencers, we receive a percentage of the compensation received by the influencer pursuant to such partnership, as set forth in each Creator Occupancy Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Creator Occupancy Agreements, influencers will have access to a fully staffed media creation team, videographers, photographers and editors, as well as collaborative filming facilities and in-house cleaning and security services that we provide. The Creator Occupancy Agreements also contain a code of conduct that the influencers must follow while living in the Clubhouse, including, but not limited to, refraining from illegal activities, and being respectful and mindful to other occupants and neighboring homes.
 
Each influencer can terminate the Creator Occupancy Agreement at any time for any reason with five days written notice to us. We can terminate the agreement at any time for any reason and must give the influencer seven days from the date of termination to vacate the Clubhouse.
 
Talent Management Services
 
Doiyen, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, is a talent management company for social media influencers. Through Doiyen, we seek to represent some of the world’s top talent in the world of social media. We plan to hire experienced talent and management agents as well as build our support and administrative resources seeking to expand operations. Our influencers include entertainers, content creators, and style icons.
 
Through Doiyen, we currently represent more than 15 social media influencers, with a combined number of followers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube of over 21,000,000. We are dedicated to helping Doiyen’s influencer-clients build their brands, maintain creative control of their destinies, and diversify and grow their businesses through “The Clubhouse,” providing them opportunities to increase their monetization potential and amplify their reach.

Talent Management Agreements
 
As a talent management company, Doiyen generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients (or “Creators”) by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Certain influencers who live in our various Clubhouses enter into an Exclusive Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement(s)”).
 
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Creator agrees that during the term of the Management Agreement, the Creator appoints Doiyen as the sole and personal manager of the Creator, and engages Doiyen to provide services, counsel and advise on the Creator’s career in social media. Such activities may include, but are not limited to, assisting in the utilization of the Creator’s likeness and representations in third party brand deals, advising on contract negotiations and artistic selection of projects, and professional and general assistance with any and all activities as a model and/or influencer through which the Creator’s talent can be developed and utilized via social media or otherwise.
 
As compensation for the services Doiyen provides pursuant to the Management Agreement, Doiyen is entitled to receive a percentage, which is generally between 10% to 50%, of all gross compensation earned and received by the Creator during the term of the Management Agreement, regardless of whether we introduced the opportunity resulting in compensation to the Creator.
 
Each Management Agreement is negotiated separately for each influencer, and Doiyen’s compensation varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the individual characteristics of the Creator (i.e., the number of followers the Creator has, etc.) and the source of the business opportunities resulting in such compensation for the Creator. For example, if Doiyen introduced the business opportunity to the Creator, Doiyen is generally entitled to a higher percentage compensation.
 
Pursuant to the Management Agreements, each Creator has the sole right to reject or accept any offers presented by us. Pursuant to the Management Agreements, if the Creator does not receive a bona fide offer that is reasonably acceptable to them or if the Creator does not receive an aggregate payment of at least $10,000 during any consecutive 3 month period of the term of the Management Agreement, we and each the Creator have the right to terminate such Management Agreement by providing written notice to the other party of such intent to terminate.
 
We also may enter into non-exclusive management agreements with certain Creators, however this is extremely rare, as we prefer to only enter into exclusive management agreements.
 
Paid Promotion
 
Doiyen and its contracted Creators primarily generate revenue from companies paying for promotion for their brands, products, and/or services.
 
There are three primary types of arrangements through which we will receive revenues from these activities through Doiyen:
 

(1) | As a talent management company, Doiyen generates revenues based on the earnings of its influencer-clients Creators by receiving a percentage of the earnings of its Creators. Creators are often sought after directly by companies for specific branding and/or promotional opportunities. In these situations, the client-company would contract with the Creator directly, and such services provided by the Creator would fall under the Management Agreement, and Doiyen would receive a percentage of the earnings of the Creator for such services as described above. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Pursuant to the Creator Occupancy Agreements, the influencers agree to make certain posts on their own social media accounts at our direction, and we use these “deliverables” to create deals with brands and instruct the influencers to make posts on their social media accounts as required of them under the Creator Occupancy Agreements for the brands we choose to do deals with. We believe this creates what we refer to as “Free Earned Media Value.”

-


(3) | Instead of a dealing directly with individual influencers as part of the talent management services provided through Doiyen, brands can also work directly with Clubhouse’s branded social media accounts, of which WOHG owns 100%. These house accounts grow as each influencer is required to promote the house accounts under the Creator Occupancy Agreements, which require Creators to make social media posts at the direction of Doiyen on such accounts on a regular basis without additional compensation, in exchange for being provided with living arrangements. When Doiyen exercises this right to provide promotional services to a paying client through the Clubhouse’s social media accounts, Doiyen receives 100% of the compensation. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Companies that contract with Doiyen to provide such promotional activities for their advertising campaigns or custom content requests generally either prepay for services or request credit terms. Such agreements typically provide for either a non-refundable deposit, or a cancellation fee if the agreement is canceled by Doiyen prior to completion our promotional services.
 
Brand Development and Content Creation
 
Through WOH Brands, a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of WOHG, we engage and also plan to engage in a number of activities with respect to brand development and incubation, content creation, and technology development, as follows:

● | Content Creation: original long and short form content creation for streaming services or other platforms involved in content distribution; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand Development and Product Sales: acquiring or creating in-house brands and selling products in various categories, including apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle brands; and 
● | Technology: development and/or acquisition of software geared towards social media, which we may license, sell, or otherwise monetize. 

 
Through Digital Influence Inc. (doing business as Magiclytics), our 100% wholly owned subsidiary, we provide predictive analytics for content creation brand deals.
 
Brand Development
 
On May 19, 2020, WOH Brands began to engage in brand development, with a focus on creating apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle brands with quality product offerings. Through WOH Brands, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, we intend to acquire, enter into joint ventures or launch best-in-class brands with an objective of innovation and product uniqueness, derived from demographic data, market research, and omni-channel experiences.
 
WOH Brands is primarily focused on creating brands on our behalf and may consider joint-ventures with other established companies in the consumer-packaged goods space for purposes of brand and production creation. WOH Brands will not provide its branding or product services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies other than companies with which it may enter into a joint venture or other companies it contracts with to do so.
 
The first and only brand developed and launched by WOH Brands at this time is Richwife - an apparel brand founded with the mission to encourage female empowerment and success. Richwife launched in September 2020 and has several clothing items currently offered for sale on its website, www.richwifeofficial.com, including a t-shirt, crewneck sweatshirt, beanie, sweatpants, and a branded Richwife face-mask. The content available on, or accessible through, this website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not part of this annual report.
 
Richwife clothing is manufactured by a third-party manufacturer contracted by WOH Brands, which also handles sourcing of all raw materials for the clothing. Richwife currently operates on a direct-to-consumer model, and is only available online via the website www.richwifeofficial.com. WOH Brands intends to expand Richwife’s offerings into brick and mortar in the future. Richwife is currently being deployed into the Clubhouse influencer network, where it is being marketed and promoted by Clubhouse influencers through their social media accounts, which we hope will lead to sales of Richwife products.

As of the date of this annual report, WOH Brands has only sold a minimal amount of products, and has only generated minimal revenues.
 
Content Creation
 
WOH Brands acts as an internal studio for us, with the ability to develop ideas for, produce, and film content. Each of the Clubhouse locations are equipped with studios - some with separate studios within the houses and some with the entire house as a studio - and open-areas that enable content creation. As a Clubhouse Media entity, WOH Brands has access to these resources, including the Clubhouse-influencers residing at each Clubhouse location, which it can utilize for quality content creation.
 
Digital Influence Inc. (doing business as Magiclytics) provides predictive analytics for content creation brand deals.
 
As of the date of this annual report, WOH Brands’ activities in this area have been limited to assisting in the production of paid-promotional content for companies that have engaged Doiyen or Doiyen’s Creators for brand and product promotion, as well as content-creation for Richwife and Clubhouse, for which WOH Brands does not receive compensation. WOH Brands’ activities in this capacity include filming, photography, and graphic design.
 
Planned Operations
 

● | Brand Development. As stated above, WOH Brands intends to acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or create new brands in apparel, beauty, and other lifestyle categories in the future. We believe that we are in a unique position to gather data intelligence from our dealings with paid brand deals. While companies pay Doiyen and our influencers to promote their products or services, we gain firsthand insight into what type of brands (and their corresponding products and services) resonate with our demographic. We believe that this information better positions WOH Brands in deciding what type of product or service to acquire or build. WOH Brands will not provide its brand development services to third parties outside of the Clubhouse Media-family of companies, but may engage in joint ventures with third parties. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Content Creation. In the future, WOH Brands intends to create entertainment content for streaming services and other platforms in the entertainment and/or social media space. WOH Brands expects it could receive ad revenues, revenues for licensing, and/or revenues for sales of content to purchasers in this space. 
● | Technology Development / Software. WOH Brands also intends to engage in technology and software related to social media, either through development of such technologies itself, or through acquiring such technologies from other companies. WOH Brands believes there are a number of areas in which there is opportunity for software to add value to companies in the social media space. For example, WOH Brands believes that there is a need for software that provides analytic capabilities and generates predictive outcomes for returns on social media promotional spends on specific influencers. WOH Brands also believes there are opportunities for competition with certain existing social media platforms. WHO Brands intends to either develop internally or acquire such software and/or technologies, which it plans to subsequently license, sell, or otherwise monetize to generate revenues. 

Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Social Media and Influencer Marketing and Promotion
 
Around the world, marketing is a key strategy for brands to obtain exposure, achieve better recall, communicate themes and drive increased consumer engagement. Globally, in 2018, there was an estimated spend of $66 billion on sponsorships, up from $43 billion in 2008, according to Statista 2019-Worldwide; IEG; 2007 to 2017. As for the overall advertising landscape, Zenith estimated that global advertising spending reached $579 billion in 2018, and will grow at a CAGR of 4% through 2020.

Advertising has shifted significantly towards social media over the last few years, and social media influencers who are the primary form of advertisement distribution is highly disorganized. We believe that one of the most important aspects of building a company or launching a product is social media marketing. According to an article titled “Global social media research summary July 2020” by Smart Insights dated August 3, 2020, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, social media experienced a 43% increase in usage. According to an article titled “55 critical social media statistics to fuel your 2020 strategy” published by SproutSocial dated January 7, 2020, the amount spent on advertising over social media will likely reach $102 billion by 2020.
 
According to a Business Insider Intelligence report titled “Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2020” published in December 2019, influencer marketing spending has grown significantly since 2015 and is expected to reach $15 billion annually by 2022. According to the same source, currently 66% of companies spend over 10% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and 17% of companies allocate more than 50% of their marketing budget on influencer marketing and the percentage is expected to grow as more companies become comfortable with the channel. Also, according to the same source, companies surveyed about influencer marketing noted that content quality, aligned target audience demographic and engagement rate were the three most important determinants in choosing influencer partners and that the two most important goals for influencer marketing based on survey responses were increasing brand awareness and reaching new audiences in order to expand their existing customer base.
 
WOHG intends to capitalize on this growing social media and influencer based advertising spending, utilizing its Clubhouse influencers to attract advertisers directly, as well as generating business for Creators, for which it will receive compensation pursuant to its Management Agreements.
 
Apparel
 
The United States apparel market was valued at approximately 368 billion U.S. dollars as of 2019. Store-based retailing was valued at over 268 billion U.S., while e-commerce brought in over 100 million U.S. dollars of revenue. As the internet increasingly influences social and economic activities, the e-commerce market for retail goods is expected to grow steadily. Our core customer demographic is anywhere from 12-year old to 30-year old women and men.
Competition
 
We face competition from a variety of companies in the different areas in which we operate. We face competition from influencer houses similar to the Clubhouse, such as Hype House and Glam House. While we do not generate revenue directly from the Clubhouse, the Clubhouse enables us to attract quality, popular, talented influencers in the social media industry, which we consider to be our primary asset that enables our various business operations.
 
As a talent management company through Doiyen, we compete against other talent management companies that are specific to the social media influencer space, such as IZEA and Viral Nation. We compete with these other companies on the basis of our brand name, reputation for access to industry participants and desirable projects, as well as pricing.
 
For our brands and products, we currently compete primarily with other specialty retailers, higher-end department stores and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of women’s and men’s apparel, accessories and similar merchandise targeting customers aged 12 to 30. We believe the principal basis upon which we compete are design, quality, and price. We believe that our primary competitive advantage is high visibility, which we can achieve through our network of Clubhouse influencers.
 
In the future, we expect to compete with other content-creators for placement on streaming services and other content platforms, with technology and software companies in the social media space, and with companies making lifestyle and/or beauty products marketed to social media audiences.
 
We seek to effectively compete with such competitors by out-scaling our competition, focusing on in-house business infrastructure and providing superior support and management services for our Clubhouse influencers. We strive to have more physical locations than other influencer-house networks. Currently, we are unaware of any other company that is combining into one business the various business aspects in which we engage. In addition, we believe the experience of our management team provides us with a significant advantage in the social media influencer business, as participants in this space have traditionally lacked the business experience that our executive management team possesses, which we intend to use to our advantage. Notwithstanding, we may not be able to effectively compete with such competitors.

On June 25, 2020, the USPTO informed us that it was refusing the registration of the mark because of a likelihood of confusion with another active trademark, and advised us that we had 6 months to reply and to submit evidence and arguments in support of registration of the mark. Unfortunately, we did not reply to the USPTO within the six-month period. Therefore, we plan to file a petition to revive our trademark application with the USPTO.

Clubhouse Media Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 19, 2006 with the name Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. by Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. (“NTH”). On the same day, Tongji, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Colorado. Tongji, Inc. was later dissolved on March 25, 2011.
 
NTH was established in Nanning in the province of Guangxi of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) by the Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.
 
NTH was a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of Nanning and Guangxi province with 105 licensed beds. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, and prevention.

On December 27, 2006, Tongji, Inc. acquired 100% of the equity of NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we issued 15,652,557 shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of NTH obtained control of the entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as the continuing operating entity. The Company, through NTH, thereafter operated the hospital, until the Company eventually sold NTH, as described below.
 
Effective December 31, 2017, under the terms of a Bill of Sale, we agreed to sell, transfer convey and assign forever all of its rights, title and interest in its equity ownership interest in its subsidiary, NTH, to Placer Petroleum Co., LLC, an Arizona limited liability company. Pursuant to the Bill of Sale, consideration for this sale, transfer conveyance and assignment is Placer Petroleum Co, LLC assuming all assets and liabilities of NTH as of December 31, 2017. As a result of the Bill of Sale, the related assets and liabilities of Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. was reported as discontinued operations effective December 31, 2017. Thereafter, the Company had minimal operations.
 
On May 20, 2019, pursuant to Case Number A-19-793075-P, Nevada’s 8th Judicial District, Business Court entered and Order Granting Application of Joseph Arcaro as Custodian of Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. pursuant to NRS 78.347(1)(b), pursuant to which Joseph Arcaro was appointed custodian of the Company and given authority to reinstate the Company with the State of Nevada under NRS 78.347. On May 23, 2019, Joseph Arcaro filed a Certificate of Reinstatement of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. In addition, on May 23, 2019, Joseph Arcaro filed an Annual List of the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, designating himself as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the Company for the filing period of 2017 to 2019. On November 13, 2019, Mr. Arcaro filed a Motion to Terminate Custodianship of Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. pursuant to NRS 78.650(4) with the District Court in Clark County Nevada. On December 6, 2019, the court granted Mr. Arcaro’s motion, and the custodianship was terminated.
 
Effective May 29, 2020, Joseph Arcaro, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director and the beneficial owner, through his ownership of Algonquin Partners Inc. (“Algonquin”), of 65% of the Company’s common stock, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and among West of Hudson Group, Inc., the Company, Algonquin, and Mr. Arcaro. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, WOHG agreed to purchase, and Algonquin agreed to sell, 30,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for payment by WOHG to Algonquin of $240,000 (the “Stock Purchase”). Thereafter, WOHG distributed the 30,000,000 shares of the Company among the shareholders of WOHG. The Stock Purchase closed on June 18, 2020, resulting in a change of control of the Company.
 
On July 7, 2020, we amended our articles of incorporation whereby we increased our authorized capital stock to 550,000,000 shares, comprised of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001.
 
Recent Developments
 
Share Exchange Agreement – West of Hudson Group, Inc.
 
On August 11, 2020, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with (i) WOHG; (ii) each of the WOHG Shareholders; and (iii) Mr. Ben-Yohanan as the Shareholders’ Representative.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that the Company would acquire 100% of WOHG’s issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance to the WOHG Shareholders of a number of shares of the Company’s common stock to be determined at the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement.
 
On November 12, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of Nevada to designate one share of the preferred stock of the Company as the Series X Preferred Stock of the Company.
 
The closing of the Share Exchange Agreement occurred on November 12, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 200 shares WOHG’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of WOHG, in exchange for the issuance to the WOHG Shareholders of 46,811,195 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, WOHG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

In addition, on November 20, 2020, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and subsequent Waiver, the Company issued and sold to Amir Ben-Yohanan one share of Series X Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1.00. This one share of Series X Preferred Stock has a number of votes equal to all of the other votes entitled to be cast on any matter by any other shares or securities of the Company plus one, but will not have any economic or other interest in the Company.
 
The Share Exchange is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Share Exchange Agreement is intended to be a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes.
 
On November 12, 2020, pursuant to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired WOHG, and WOHG thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary, and the business of WOHG became the business of the Company going forward.
 
Name Change
 
On November 2, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to amend its Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc.” to “Clubhouse Media Group, Inc.”

Share Exchange Agreement - Magiclytics
 
On February 3, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement (the “A&R Share Exchange Agreement”) by and between the Company, Digital Influence Inc., a Wyoming corporation doing business as Magiclytics (“Magiclytics”), each of the shareholders of Magiclytics (the “Magiclytics Shareholders”) and Christian Young, as the representative of the Magiclytics Shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”). Christian Young is the President, Secretary, and a Director of the Company, and is also an officer, director, and significant shareholder of Magiclytics.
 
The A&R Share Exchange Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the previous Share Exchange Agreement between the same parties, which was executed on December 3, 2020. The A&R Share Exchange Agreement replaces the Share Exchange Agreement in its entirety.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the Magiclytics Shareholders, who hold an aggregate of 5,000 shares of Magiclytics’ common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Magiclytics Shares”), all 5,000 Magiclytics Shares, representing 100% of Magiclytics’ issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the Magiclytics Shareholders of the 734,689 shares of the Company’s common stock based on a $3,500,000 valuation of Magiclytics, to be apportioned between the Magiclytics Shareholders pro rata based on their respective ownership of Magiclytics Shares.
 
On February 3, 2021 (the “Magiclytics Closing Date”), the parties closed on the transactions contemplated in the A&R Share Exchange Agreement, and the Company agreed to issue 734,689 shares of Company common stock to the Magiclytics Shareholders in exchange for all 5,000 Magiclytics Shares (the “Magiclytics Closing”). On February 3, 2021, pursuant to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired Magiclytics, and Magiclytics thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
At the Magiclytics Closing, we agreed to issue to Christian Young and Wilfred Man each 330,610 shares of Company Common Stock, representing 45% each, or 90% in total of the Company common stock which we agreed to issue to the Magiclytics Shareholders at the Magiclytics Closing. As of February 7, 2021, we have not issued the 734,689 shares to the Magiclytics shareholders.

The number of shares of the Company common stock issued at the Magiclytics Closing was based on the fair market value of the Company common stock as initially agreed to by the parties, which is $4.76 per share (the “Base Value”). The fair market value was determined based on the volume weighted average closing price of the Company common stock for the 20-trading day period immediately prior to the Magiclytics. In the event that the initial public offering price per share of the Company common stock in our Regulation A offering is less than the Base Value, then within three business days of the qualification by the SEC of the Offering Statement forming part of our Regulation A offering circular, the Company will issue to the Magiclytics Shareholders a number of additional shares of Company common stock equal to:
 

(1) | $3,500,000 divided by the initial public offering price per share of the Company common stock in our Regulation A offering, minus; 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | 734,689. 

 
The resulting number of shares of the Company common stock pursuant to the above calculation will be referred to as the “Additional Shares”, and such Additional Shares will also be issued to the Magiclytics Shareholders pro rata based on their respective ownership of Magiclytics Shares.
 
In addition to the exchange of shares between the Magiclytics Shareholders and the Company described above, on the Magiclytics Closing Date the parties took a number of other actions in connection with the Magiclytics Closing pursuant to the terms of the A&R Share Exchange Agreement:
 

(i) | The Board of Directors of Magiclytics (the “Magiclytics Board”) expanded the size of the Magiclytics Board to 3 persons and named Simon Yu, a current officer and director of the Company as a director of the Magiclytics Board. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Magiclytics Board named Wilfred Man as the Chief Executive Officer of Magiclytics, Christian Young as the President and Secretary of the Magiclytics and Simon Yu as the Chief Operating Officer of Magiclytics. 

 
Further, immediately following the Magiclytics Closing, the Company assumed responsibility for all outstanding accounts payables and operating costs to continue operations of Magiclytics including but not limited to payment to any of its vendors, lenders, or other parties in which Magiclytics engages with in the regular course of its business.

At such time, the February 2021 GS Capital Note (and the principal amount and any accrued and unpaid interest) will be convertible at a conversion price equal to 70% of the initial offering price of the Company Common Stock in the Regulation A Offering, subject to a customary beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99%, which may be waived by GS Capital on 61 days’ notice to the Company. The conversion price is subject to customary adjustments for any stock splits, etc. which occur following the determination of the conversion price.
 
The February 2021 GS Capital Note contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to:
 
●       if the Company fails to pay the then-outstanding principal amount and accrued interest on the GS Capital Note on any date any such amounts become due and payable, and any such failure is not cured within three business days of written notice thereof by GS Capital;
 ●       the Company fails to remain compliant with the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), thus incurring a “chilled” status with DTC;
 ●       any trading suspension is imposed by the SEC under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act; or
 ●       the occurrence of any delisting of the Company Common Stock from any securities exchange on which the Company Common Stock is listed or suspension of trading of the Company Common Stock on the OTC Markets.
 
If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, GS Capital may declare all or any portion of the then-outstanding principal amount of the February 2021 GS Capital Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, due and payable, and the February 2021 GS Capital Note shall thereupon become immediately due and payable in cash and February 2021 GS Capital will also have the right to pursue any other remedies that GS Capital may have under applicable law. In the event that any amount due under the February 2021 GS Capital Note is not paid as and when due, such amounts shall accrue interest at the rate of 18% per year, simple interest, non-compounding, until paid.
 
Convertible Promissory Note – Labrys Fund, LP
 
On March 11, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Labrys SPA”) with Labrys Fund, LP (“Labrys”), pursuant to which the Company issued a 10% promissory note (the “Labrys Note”) with a maturity date of March 11, 2022 (the “Labrys Maturity Date”), in the principal sum of $1,000,000. In addition, the Company issued 125,000 shares of its common stock to Labrys as a commitment fee pursuant to the Labrys SPA. Pursuant to the terms of the Labrys Note, the Company agreed to pay to $1,000,000 (the “Principal Sum”) to Labrys and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of 10% per annum. The Labrys Note carries an original issue discount (“OID”) of $100,000. Accordingly, on the Closing Date (as defined in the Labrys SPA), Labrys paid the purchase price of $900,000 in exchange for the Labrys Note. Labrys may convert the Labrys Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the beneficial ownership limitations of 4.99% in the Labrys Note) at any time at a conversion price equal to $10.00 per share.
 
The Company may prepay the Labrys Note at any time prior to the date that an Event of Default (as defined in the Labrys Note) occurs at an amount equal to 100% of the Principal Sum then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest (no prepayment premium) plus $750.00 for administrative fees. The Labrys Note contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, and breach of provisions of the Labrys Note or Labrys SPA.
 
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Labrys Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company shall pay to Labrys, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the Principal Sum then outstanding plus accrued interest multiplied by 125% (the “Default Amount”). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, additional interest will accrue from the date of the Event of Default at the rate equal to the lower of 16% per annum or the highest rate permitted by law.
