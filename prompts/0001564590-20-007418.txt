Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine involves discovering and developing therapies that target the biological basis of disease for patient populations whose condition is defined by shared underlying defects and/or disease characteristics. By targeting the biomechanical defects underlying a given condition, we believe our therapeutic candidates can correct or offset the downstream disruption in cardiac muscle function that drives disease progression.  
 Since our inception in 2012, we have generated a robust pipeline of small molecules that target diseases of the heart muscle, or cardiomyopathies. Our initial research has focused on genetic mutations in sarcomeric proteins of the heart muscle. These mutations directly affect the power of contraction, the rate of relaxation, or both, reducing the overall ability of the heart to pump blood at an output that matches the needs of the rest of the body. Our lead therapeutic candidate, mavacamten, is an orally administered allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin being developed for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is the most common heritable cardiomyopathy, estimated to affect one in every 500 people worldwide.  Mavacamten is intended to reduce cardiac muscle contractility and enhance diastolic relaxation by inhibiting the excessive myosin-actin cross-bridge formation that underlies the excessive contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced compliance which are characteristic of HCM.  
 Mavacamten is initially being developed to address the obstructive form of the disease, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of the HCM patient population.  Data from our pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial of approximately 250 patients with obstructive HCM are anticipated in the second quarter of 2020.  Pending the outcome of the EXPLORER-HCM study, we plan to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking regulatory approval of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM.  
 Based on evidence generated from clinical and preclinical studies, we tested mavacamten in our Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM study, which enrolled patients with the non-obstructive form of HCM to more directly assess mavacamten’s impact on diastolic dysfunction.  This study was completed in November of 2019; results have provided a basis for advancing mavacamten into a planned Phase 2 clinical trial in a targeted population of heart failure patients whose disease is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, commonly referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  MAVERICK-HCM data also support the advancement of mavacamten into late-stage studies of non-obstructive HCM patients.  We plan to present and/or publish complete results from the MAVERICK-HCM study in the first quarter of 2020.  We are also seeking to review the data generated to date in the non-obstructive HCM population with the FDA and obtain input on future study design in this indication.
 Patients who complete either the EXPLORER-HCM or MAVERICK-HCM studies are eligible to enroll in a MAVA long-term extension (LTE) study of mavacamten (MAVA-LTE).  In addition, we continue to follow patients from our Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study in the PIONEER-OLE open-label extension study. In addition, we expect to initiate a new clinical trial (VALOR-HCM) by mid-2020, to assess whether treatment with mavacamten may obviate the need for invasive septal reduction procedures.
 In addition to mavacamten, we have generated the following programs to address a variety of disruptions in heart muscle contraction and filling:
  
• | Danicamtiv (formally MYK-491) is our orally-administered small molecule designed to increase cardiac contractility without impairing diastolic filling in patients with systolic heart failure, commonly referred to as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF. We are initially developing danicamtiv for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2a safety studies. Our next study of danicamtiv will be Phase 2 study in patients with genetically driven DCM caused by mutations of the sarcomere which we plan to initiate in the second quarter of 2020. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MYK-224 is our second small molecule program for the treatment of HCM targeting hypercontractility and impaired relaxation. MYK-224 is currently in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults, for which topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2020. Pending these data, we anticipate advancing MYK-224 into a Phase 2 clinical trial before year-end 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACT-1 is directed toward increasing cardiac contractility in certain forms of genetic dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. ACT-1 has a distinct mechanism from danicamtiv and is in preclinical development.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LUS-1 is intended to counteract muscle abnormalities that result in impaired relaxation of the left ventricle, without decreasing contractility for certain cardiomyopathy or HFpEF patient populations. LUS-1 is currently advancing through preclinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have discovered all of the compounds in our pipeline internally and retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our programs. We believe consolidated control over our entire portfolio will allow us to make strategic decisions about how we advance each of our therapeutic candidates in alignment with our precision medicine approach.

Our Strategy
 We are pioneering a precision medicine approach to the discovery and development of targeted cardiovascular disease therapeutics. Our strategy for success in this area includes three core tenets:

1) | Apply a precision medicine approach to cardiovascular disease drug discovery, development and commercialization. We begin by understanding the biomechanical factors underpinning disease. We then leverage this knowledge to pursue therapeutic candidates that target the proteins that modulate a given condition to correct the underlying defect. Our aim is to match the mechanism of the molecule to the mechanism of disease. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Commit to disease-area leadership. Our precision approach is reliant on identifying relatively homogenous subgroups of patients with shared genotypic or phenotypic disease characteristics. These subgroups, united by common biologic markers rather than just disease symptoms, may not have been previously well characterized. As our product candidates advance through clinical testing, we are building deep relationships with researchers, physicians, caregivers, advocates and patients to create an extended community dedicated to advancing diagnosis, treatment and disease management. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Grow our pipeline guided by a cycle of learning that integrates clinical and molecular information with insights into disease biology. We utilize plasma and imaging biomarkers to directly measure the effects of our product candidates and by focusing on homogenous segments of a patient population, we are able to generate robust signals early in relatively small and efficient clinical trials. We are then able to apply our insights from the clinic back into the pipeline – inspiring new molecular targets and follow-on indications. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform 
 Our precision medicine platform incorporates disease research, drug discovery and clinical expertise in a self-reinforcing cycle of learning that enables the iterative generation of new disease targets and clinical development candidates designed to establish early clinical proof-of-concept. By efficiently developing product candidates that target distinct biomechanical defects associated with cardiac muscle contraction, we use clinical feedback on patient genetics, response to therapy and disease presentation to refine our understanding of which patients are most likely to benefit from our product candidates. We believe this virtuous cycle is a competitive advantage that enables us to efficiently develop therapies with disease-modifying potential for heritable cardiomyopathies that could also be applied to other cardiovascular diseases.
 

Our lead program, mavacamten, serves as a case study for our platform approach.  Data from our Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study of mavacamten in obstructive HCM provided new insights into the mechanism of the molecule which then served as the basis of our Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM study of mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM.  In parallel, those clinical insights are being applied to our research-stage LUS-1 program and the development plans for MYK-224, our second clinical-stage HCM product candidate.  The data generated from the Phase 2 MAVERICK HCM study provided us with valuable and proprietary insights that are enabling us to advance mavacamten in the non-obstructive HCM patient population, as well as to pursue a proof-of-concept study in a targeted population of heart failure patients whose condition shares many characteristics with HCM.  
 5


Our discovery process begins with a deep mechanistic understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect the biomechanical function of the heart. This starting point is then translated into screens that help us identify small molecule agents that have the potential to be optimized to restore normal biomechanical function. The most promising of these agents are then tested in preclinical animal models that we believe are translatable to and predictive of human systems. These models are also used to develop biomarkers of drug action and, when possible, disease modification, that integrate into our early clinical development strategies. Across this entire spectrum, we leverage novel insights generated from our position at the center of the cardiomyopathy ecosystem. By applying this cycle to multiple programs, we have generated a growing library of proprietary therapeutic molecules that target a wide range of potential cardiac disease-related mechanisms and that can be used to test new hypotheses arising from our clinical research.
 Our Approach
 Traditional Cardiovascular Drug Development 
 Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability both in the United States and globally. In the United States alone, heart diseases affect 92 million Americans and account for a $316 billion annual cost burden. Despite the increasing global burden of cardiovascular disease, investment in cardiovascular drug development has stagnated over the past two decades, resulting in a shortage of innovative therapies addressing the underlying causes of disease. 
 We believe that innovation in cardiovascular drug development has been hindered by the following traditional approaches: 
 
 
• | Existing therapies are designed to treat the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large, outcome-based studies are needed to demonstrate statistical significance, requiring lengthy and expensive trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In order to be commercially viable, therapies must address large populations without differentiating among patient subgroups.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These challenges have resulted in a relatively low number of new molecular entities approved by the FDA for cardiovascular disease compared to other disease areas. In 2019, only one of the forty-eight new medicines approved by the FDA was for a cardiovascular disease indication. By way of contrast, ten of the new medicines receiving FDA approval in 2019 were new oncology drugs. We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve cardiovascular disease treatment through the use of precision medicine for the discovery and development of new treatments.
 The MyoKardia Solution
 We believe that our precision medicine platform can overcome many of the obstacles facing cardiovascular drug discovery and development that have resulted in a lack of cardiovascular therapeutic innovation:

• | Our precision medicine platform enables the discovery and development of therapies with disease-modifying potential. We believe our deep understanding of the biomechanical defects that cause certain cardiomyopathies and forms of heart failure allows us to target critical or causal disease mechanisms. We intend to develop each of our product candidates to prevent or reverse disease progression by correcting underlying biomechanical defects in the heart’s contractile machinery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our clinical development approach is designed to investigate efficacy and safety in smaller, less time-consuming clinical trials. We believe we can significantly reduce the time and cost of drug development for cardiovascular indications by targeting the underlying cause of disease, which we believe increases the chance they will be effective and reduces the potential for unintended consequences or off-target effects. Through the use of appropriate predictive biomarkers and patient selection strategies, we believe that we can reduce the risk of late-stage clinical failures. This approach is consistent with recent FDA communications and publications on how the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry can improve efficiency and the likelihood of success in cardiovascular drug development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are committed to disease area leadership. We have formed long-standing relationships with HCM patient advocacy groups and academic and clinical researchers to create an extended community dedicated to advancing our understanding of HCM. We aim to educate, foster and advance the broader HCM ecosystem, to encourage better diagnosis, better disease management and better treatment. In 2014, we launched the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe). SHaRe is a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on more than 9,000 individuals and family members affected by HCM and DCM, funded by research grants from MyoKardia. Data generated from SHaRe provides new insights into disease genetics, burden and progression, and is a component of our precision medicine platform. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We retain global development and commercialization rights to all our programs. We believe consolidated control over our entire portfolio will allow us to make strategic decisions about how we advance each of our therapeutic candidates in alignment with our precision medicine approach.

Our Scientific Focus 
 Targeting Cardiac Muscle Contraction 
 Our initial research has focused on genetic mutations in sarcomeric proteins of the heart muscle. A sarcomere is an assembly of proteins that forms the smallest contractile unit of muscle. Each cardiac muscle cell contains many sarcomeres, and these cells are arranged in an organized manner as cardiac muscle fiber. Thousands of sarcomeres acting in concert provide the ensemble force for muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of a thin filament and a thick filament, each of which contains multiple proteins braided together. To initiate contraction, myosin, the motor protein anchored to the thick filament, binds to actin, the main protein of the thin filament, forming a cross-bridge. The contraction of the sarcomere is driven by the swinging of the cross-bridge causing the thin filament to slide over the thick filament, shortening the length of a sarcomere. Myosin attaches to the thin filament, pulls it forward and detaches in a tightly-regulated cycle. In the heart, contraction corresponds to systole and relaxation corresponds to diastole.
 
In the graphic below, the dark myosin heads are engaged with the thin filament, each forming a cross-bridge between actin and myosin.
 

Mutations in cardiac sarcomere proteins that disrupt normal cardiac muscle contraction underpin a number of types of cardiovascular disease by affecting the power of contraction, the rate of relaxation, or both, and thereby reducing the overall ability of the heart to pump blood at an output that matches the needs of the body at rest and with exertion. The disruptions in cardiac muscle contraction result in abnormal intracardiac blood pressures and chamber volumes and thickening or thinning of the walls of the heart. These pathological changes often result in a cascade of events with devastating consequences to patients, including reduced exercise capacity limited by shortness of breath or chest pain, reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, stroke, progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In some patients, these events result in the need for heart transplantation.
 There are hundreds of individual mutations that have been identified in the genes encoding the proteins of the sarcomere. These many mutations give rise to a few common biomechanical defects in the sarcomere at the protein level. Through our research, we have linked these biomechanical defects to three distinct cardiac muscle disruptions that act to cause the excessive contraction, impaired relaxation and/or insufficient contraction underlying many forms of heart failure. 
 Our Pipeline and Target Indications
 We have generated several proprietary, orally administered small molecules to address a variety of biomechanical defects that cause disruptions in heart muscle contraction. By correcting the underlying biomechanical defects, we believe our targeted therapies can correct or offset the downstream disruption in cardiac muscle function that drives disease progression.

The following table summarizes our product development pipeline: 
 

Heart Failure and Heritable Cardiomyopathies 
 Heart failure describes any condition in which the heart is unable to fill or pump blood sufficient to meet the needs of the body. According to the American Heart Association, heart failure affects approximately 6 million people in the United States. Even as the rate of heart disease-related mortality has slowed as the U.S. population aged 65 or over has increased, deaths associated with heart failure have increased by nearly 40% from the period 2011 to 2017. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in every eight deaths in the U.S. is associated with heart failure.
 Systolic heart failure occurs when the left ventricle becomes distended, and the heart muscle weakens and is unable to contract with sufficient force to pump the amount of oxygenated and nutrient-filled blood the body needs.  The terms systolic heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy are sometimes used interchangeably to describe this condition. Systolic heart failure makes up a little less than half the overall heart failure population, or approximately 3 million people in the United States. Current treatment for HFrEF typically includes a regimen of multiple pills aimed at alleviating some symptoms, including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.  More recently, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), have been introduced as another class of compounds aimed at symptom control by reducing blood pressure and helping to manage sodium and fluid levels.  
 Diastolic heart failure, also called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), occurs when the heart is unable to properly fill with blood during the period between each contraction.  The left ventricle is less distensible than normal, requiring a high pressure to fill, particularly during stress.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one example of a disease in which the excess contractility of the heart has resulted in hypertrophy and stiffness that prevents the normal filling and pumping of blood.  Diseases of diastolic dysfunction are estimated to affect approximately 3 million people in the United States, and there are currently no approved treatments proven to improve outcomes in patients with diastolic heart failure.
 8


The causes of heart failure are varied and diverse and can include damage to the heart muscle from myocardial infarctions, toxic effects of cancer chemotherapy agents and genetic mutations.  Symptoms associated with HFrEF and HFpEF are often similar, including shortness of breath, edema, reduction in activities and fatigue. Heart failure is progressive; once there has been an occurrence of acute decompensation, or a sudden worsening of symptoms, patients are at higher risk of further decompensation and hospitalizations, leading to death.  Regardless of cause or whether it is heart failure associated with systolic or diastolic dysfunction, the five-year survival outlook for heart failure following an initial hospitalization for sudden worsening of symptoms is similar to that of Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer as displayed below.


We believe that heart failure, whether occurring due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction, is made up of a number of distinct patient segments, each of which may be driven by shared genetic or phenotypic characteristics.  Starting with heritable cardiomyopathies, such as HCM and DCM, we are discovering and developing novel targeted therapeutics tailored to address the biomechanical dysfunction in cardiac muscle contraction underlying a given condition. While some of our candidates may have broad applicability to diseases of systolic or diastolic function, our strategy is to apply a precision medicine approach to our drug development efforts. As we achieve robust signals of therapeutic activity in a given targeted population, we may seek to study adjacent populations with similar disease characteristics.

Overview of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
HCM is defined as an otherwise unexplained thickening of the walls of the heart, known as hypertrophy. HCM is caused by mutations in the sarcomere that result in excessive cardiac muscle contraction. The consequences include reduced left ventricular blood volumes and cardiac output, reduced ability of the left ventricle to expand, and high cardiac filling pressures. These can all contribute to reduced effort tolerance and symptoms that include shortness of breath and chest pain. Additionally, other structural changes such as left atrial enlargement occur, leading to the development of arrhythmias and heart failure.
 

HCM is a chronic disease, and for the majority of patients the disease progresses slowly with the development of severe symptoms despite existing medical therapies. Mild physical exertion can quickly result in fatigue or shortness of breath, and a patient’s ability to participate in normal work, family or recreational activities can be substantially curtailed. According to research published in Circulation by SHaRe researchers who evaluated data from nearly 4,600 patients, people with HCM have significantly higher mortality compared to that of the general U.S. population. Further, patients with genetic HCM exhibited disease at younger ages and were more likely to experience HCM-related complications and early death. In approximately 15% to 20% of patients, disease progression results in disabling heart failure that can prevent the patients from holding a job or performing everyday activities of daily living. HCM can also cause stroke or sudden cardiac death. HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, with a five-year incidence among children of 3%. 
 HCM affects approximately one in every 500 people worldwide and is the most frequent form of heritable cardiomyopathy. It is estimated that as many as 630,000 people in the United States have a form of HCM, and based on insurance claims data, an estimated 100,000 of these individuals have been diagnosed with the disease. 
 Obstructive HCM Patients. In approximately two-thirds of HCM patients, the path followed by blood exiting the heart, known as the left ventricular outflow tract, or LVOT, becomes obstructed by the enlarged and diseased muscle, restricting the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Patients with this obstructive form of HCM are at increased risk for heart failure and death. 
 Non-Obstructive HCM Patients. Symptomatic non-obstructive, HCM patients represent a distinct subgroup that is difficult to manage medically. This segment may contain a more severely affected population because non-obstructive HCM patients are typically diagnosed when their disease is more advanced than obstructive HCM patients. Furthermore, while obstructive HCM patients often experience symptom improvement with relief of the obstruction, no such treatment option is available to non-obstructive HCM patients. 
 Current Standard of Care for Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 
 The current standard of care for HCM is limited, and many patients remain symptomatic. The beta-blocker propranolol is recommended for the treatment of symptomatic HCM. However, beta blockers are frequently ineffective and have off-target adverse effects that limit their use. Patients are therefore prescribed additional drugs indicated for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure or other cardiovascular disorders more generally. These drugs, including non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil and diltiazem) and the antiarrhythmic disopyramide, do not address the underlying cause of HCM, do not appear to affect disease progression, and have limited tolerability. While clinical experience and expert opinion suggest that these drugs may provide symptom relief in some patients, no controlled clinical research evidence exists to directly support their efficacy. For a subset of HCM patients with more advanced disease progression or more pronounced symptoms, surgical or other invasive interventions may be appropriate, including heart transplantation, use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, open surgical myectomy or percutaneous alcohol septal ablation.

Mavacamten for Obstructive HCM
 Mavacamten is a novel, oral, allosteric inhibitor of cardiac myosin.  It is intended to reduce cardiac muscle contractility by inhibiting the excessive myosin-actin cross-bridge formation that underlies the excessive contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced compliance characteristic of HCM. Mavacamten is currently being evaluated, through the pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM study, for efficacy and safety in the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM. Topline data from the EXPLORER-HCM trial are anticipated in the second quarter of 2020. Pending the outcome of this study, we plan to file an NDA seeking regulatory approval of mavacamten for the treatment of obstructive HCM.  Additional ongoing studies of mavacamten include the MAVA long-term extension study, the PIONEER open-label extension (OLE) study. The VALOR-HCM clinical trial, which will evaluate the potential of mavacamten to mitigate the need for invasive septal reduction procedures, is expected to begin in mid-2020.
 
EXPLORER-HCM is a multi-national randomized double-blind Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30 weeks of once-daily treatment with mavacamten in patients with obstructive HCM. Patients are randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either mavacamten or placebo for a 30-week treatment period. The primary endpoint is a composite functional endpoint, achieved by either 1) an improvement of at least 1.5 mL/kg/min in peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) accompanied by an improvement from baseline of at least one NYHA functional class or 2) an improvement from baseline of 3.0 mL/kg/min or greater in peak VO2 without worsening in NYHA functional class. Secondary endpoints include the changes from baseline in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient, NYHA functional class, and peak VO2. Exploratory endpoints include changes in echocardiographic indices of cardiac structure and function, N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, quality of life questionnaire scores and daily physical activity assessed using a wearable accelerometer. Following the 30-week treatment period and eight-week post-treatment wash-out period, patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study of mavacamten.
 The EXPLORER-HCM trial design incorporates individualized dosing, including two dose adjustments during the 30-week treatment period based on measurements of LVOT gradient. All assessments and dose adjustments are conducted in a blinded fashion. Patients are allowed to maintain their HCM-related background medications for the duration of the EXPLORER-HCM Phase 3 trial, including beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. An independent data monitoring committee has been established to monitor safety throughout the study and has met approximately every three months since EXPLORER-HCM was initiated in mid-2018. Enrollment in EXPLORER-HCM concluded in August of 2019 and enrolled a total of 251 patients with clinical sites from across 13 countries.  We expect to announce topline data from the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM study in the second quarter of 2020.
 MAVA-LTE
 MAVA-LTE is a long-term extension study initiated in 2018.  MAVA-LTE is enrolling patients who have completed the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM study or our Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM study of mavacamten for non-obstructive HCM. The MAVA-LTE study will assess long-term safety of mavacamten, as well as its effects on symptoms and echocardiographic measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function. We intend to enroll up to 280 patients in the MAVA-LTE study, and approximately 100 patients will be randomized to participate in a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sub-study to assess the potential effects of mavacamten treatment on cardiac remodeling.
PIONEER-OLE
 In the second quarter of 2018, we initiated an open-label study enrolling patients from our Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial.  We have presented data from the PIONEER-OLE study at twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six and forty-eight weeks.  These data confirmed the results from the PIONEER-HCM study; mavacamten treatment reduced LVOT gradient to below diagnostic thresholds (30 mmHg) in the majority of patients, and below the threshold for invasive intervention (50mmHg) in all patients at all time points reported.  At baseline, patients enrolled in PIONEER-OLE were symptomatic with a NYHA classification of II or III.  As NYHA was evaluated at weeks 24 and 48, a majority of patients (nine of twelve) achieved Class I, or asymptomatic, status.  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remained above normal (50%) in all 12 patients at all times of assessment.  Mavacamten has been well tolerated through one year of treatment.  There have been no cardiac-related adverse events, and all treatment-associated adverse events have been mild-to-moderate and transient.
 In addition to these observations, over the course of the PIONEER-OLE study we have noted improvements in a number of biomarkers of cardiac health moving toward normal.  At Week 48:
  
• | NT-proBNP, an established circulating blood marker of cardiac wall stress, significantly decreased to a mean of 137 pg/mL from a baseline of 594 pg/mL. A normal NT-proBNP is considered less than 125 pg/mL and NT-proBNP levels in HCM patients of <310 pg/mL have been associated with a 75% reduction in the rate of heart failure-related death or hospitalization, progression to end-stage disease, and stroke, as compared with patients with levels ≥310 pg/mL. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E/e’, an echocardiographic measure of left ventricular filling pressure, decreased with statistical significance from a mean baseline measure of 12.8 to 9.1.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11


 
• | Left atrial volume index (LAVI) decreased to normal levels, from a baseline mean of 41 mL/m2 to a mean of 32 mL/m2. A normal range for LAVI is 16-34 mLm2. Left atrial volumes provide an indication of the filling pressure of the left ventricle, and increased volumes are potentially associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in HCM patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reductions in interventricular septal (IVS) thickness as measured by echocardiography were observed, from a mean of 17mm at baseline to 15mm at 48 weeks of mavacamten treatment. Studies of HCM patients following septal reduction interventions have shown that IVS reductions in HCM patients are associated with improvements in LVOT gradient, functional capacity and symptoms. The risk of sudden cardiac death in HCM patients has been observed to increase progressively as wall thickness increases above 15mm.

VALOR-HCM
 In September 2019, we announced our intent to study mavacamten as a therapeutic alternative to septal reduction therapy, or SRT. The VALOR-HCM study will be conducted at leading HCM centers that regularly perform surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation procedures, with support from the established referral networks at those centers. The randomized, double-blind study will enroll symptomatic, obstructive HCM patients referred for SRT, and MyoKardia anticipates that enrollment will begin in mid-2020.  The study is being conducted in partnership with Cleveland Clinic C5 Research.
 Each year, approximately 1,500 patients with obstructive HCM undergo septal reduction therapy in the United States. SRT is performed as either an open-heart surgical procedure, known as a myectomy, or injection of alcohol into the heart muscle, which causes the heart muscle cells in the thickened area to die. Both procedures are intended to reduce the thickness of the septal wall and alleviate obstruction.
 PIONEER-HCM
 Our Phase 2 clinical trial of mavacamten was a twelve-week open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of mavacamten in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM. PIONEER-HCM consisted of two dosing cohorts: in Cohort A, patients received a once-daily 10mg, 15mg or 20mg dose of mavacamten and were required to discontinue background therapy, including beta blockers, prior to study entry; in Cohort B, subjects received a once-daily 2mg or 5mg oral dose of mavacamten and nine out ten patients remained on beta blocker therapy. Baseline patient characteristics were similar across both patient cohorts.
 
Mavacamten achieved statistically significant changes in the primary endpoint of post-exercise LVOT gradient from baseline and demonstrated improvements across key secondary endpoints including New York Heart Association, or NYHA, functional classification, exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption, or peak VO2, and change in dyspnea scores. The following table summarizes the data from our PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 study:
 

 
 | Cohort A | Cohort B 
Number of patients | n=11* | n=10 
Mavacamten doses studied | 10mg, 15mg, 20mg QD | 2mg, 5mg QD
Change, from baseline to W12 | Mean ± SD | p-value | Mean ± SD | p-value
Post-exercise LVOT gradient (mmHg) | -112 ± 63.8 | 0.002 | -25 ± 28.7 | 0.020 
Resting LVOT gradient (mmHg) | -55 ± 41.8 | 0.006 | -49 ± 48.0 | 0.004 
Resting LVEF (%) | -16 ± 14.1 | 0.008 | -5.5 ± 6.0 | 0.002 
NYHA class | -0.9 ± 0.7 | 0.016 | -1.0 ± 0.5 | 0.004 
Peak VO2 (mL/kg/min) | +3.5 ± 3.25 | 0.004 | +1.7 ± 2.3 | 0.121 
Dyspnea numerical rating scale | -3.1 ± 1.4 | 0.002 | -3.0 ± 2.8 | 0.008 
* In this first patient cohort of PIONEER-HCM, 11 patients enrolled and 10 completed the study.

 
In both cohorts, mavacamten was generally well-tolerated. One patient in the Cohort A elected to stop the study drug at Week 4 after experiencing a serious adverse event that we believe was due in part to the discontinuation of background medications to control atrial fibrillation. All other adverse events, or AEs, were mild to moderate, and a majority of the AEs were deemed to be unrelated to the study drug.
 Observations from the PIONEER-HCM study identified a target concentration range at which mavacamten is expected to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in obstructive HCM symptoms, functional classification (e.g., NYHA), and exercise capacity (e.g., peak VO2) while maintaining LVEF in a normal range of greater than or equal to 50%. Data from the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study helped inform the starting dose, guide dose adjustment and define endpoints for our Phase 3 clinical trial of mavacamten in symptomatic obstructive HCM, known as EXPLORER-HCM. We reviewed data from our Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial, as well as the EXPLORER-HCM study design, with the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products of the FDA, incorporating their input. Based on our interactions with the FDA, we believe data from the EXPLORER-HCM and MAVA-LTE studies will support our planned registrational filing with the FDA for the potential regulatory approval of mavacamten.

PHASE 1 STUDIES
 Our Phase 1 program for mavacamten consisted of three clinical trials, including two single-ascending dose (SAD) trials and one multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial. Across these three trials, we dosed 86 healthy volunteers and 15 HCM patients with mavacamten, in addition to 22 subjects that received placebo. We observed favorable tolerability of single and multiple doses of mavacamten in both healthy volunteers and HCM patients and demonstrated the ability of mavacamten to reduce cardiac muscle contractility, an important biomarker of disease. Additionally, we generated preliminary evidence in two patients with obstructive HCM that led us to believe that mavacamten could reduce LVOT obstruction.
 Mavacamten for Non-Obstructive HCM and Diseases of Diastolic Dysfunction
 MAVERICK-HCM
 Our observations from Cohort B of the PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 study, noting that even patients on low doses of mavacamten appeared to achieve improvements in symptoms and function, led to new research on mavacamten’s effect on diastolic relaxation.  Animal models of non-obstructive HCM provided further evidence that mavacamten is improving compliance of the left ventricle and thereby enabling the heart to better fill with oxygenated blood. In 2018 we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial known as MAVERICK-HCM to study mavacamten in patients with symptomatic, non-obstructive HCM.  
 The MAVERICK-HCM study enrolled a total of 59 patients randomized into one of three cohorts, including two different target concentrations of mavacamten as well as placebo. Topline data from this study, released in November 2019, showed that mavacamten was well tolerated in this population, and the observed safety data were generally consistent with observations from prior studies. Over the course of 16 weeks of study, a statistically significant reduction in NT-proBNP was observed versus placebo.  In two subgroups of patients with more severe diastolic impairment – one with elevated cardiac filling pressures and a pre-specified group of patients at higher risk for morbidity and mortality -- improvements in diastolic function and clear signals of clinical benefit were observed. 
 Based on the safety and pharmacologic benefits observed in MAVERICK-HCM, and a growing body of preclinical and clinical data indicating that mavacamten may provide benefit to individuals with diastolic dysfunction, we plan to advance mavacamten into additional studies in defined groups of patients with non-obstructive HCM and HFpEF. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2020 in a subgroup of patients with HFpEF who share many characteristics with the subgroups identified in MAVERICK-HCM.  We plan to review the data from MAVERICK-HCM with the FDA and to discuss plans for the late-stage clinical evaluation of mavacamten in patients with non-obstructive HCM.  Subject to the outcome of our discussions with the FDA, we anticipate beginning a pivotal program for non-obstructive HCM in the second half of 2020.
 MYK-224 for HCM
 MYK-224 is our second small molecule program targeting hypercontractility and impaired relaxation. In August 2019, we commenced dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 study of MYK-224 for the treatment of HCM. The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MYK-224.  MYK-224 is designed with distinct physicochemical properties that may enable certain dosing advantages for some HCM patients. In preclinical studies, MYK-224 was shown to attenuate hyperactive myosin proteins containing known pathogenic HCM mutations.  MYK-224 also modulates cardiac myosin without affecting myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics or altering calcium homeostasis.  We anticipate providing topline results from the Phase 1 study in the third quarter of 2020 and believe MYK-224 may be suited for future development in HCM or HFpEF populations.
 LUS-1 for HCM
 LUS-1 is our preclinical program to counteract a muscle abnormality that results in impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. Our LUS-1 discovery-stage program is identifying novel therapeutics that target diastolic relaxation without reducing the force of contraction. In preclinical studies of LUS-1 molecules, we have observed improved compliance without a loss of stroke volume.  LUS-1 is intended to counteract a muscle disruption that results in impaired relaxation of the heart, a biomechanical defect thought to be a causal factor in numerous types of diastolic heart failure, as well as specific HCM patient subgroups and less common heritable cardiomyopathies.

Overview of Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
 The fundamental cause of all systolic heart failure is that the heart muscles are not able to contract with sufficient force. In DCM, the loss of contractility leads the walls of the left ventricle to become thin and over-expanded, functioning under increased stress. This leads to even further progression of cardiac dysfunction. In contrast to HCM, some forms of DCM are characterized by decreased power output of the sarcomeres. In some patients with genetic DCM, this lack of power is caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the ability of individual myosin motors to form cross-bridges with actin and contribute to overall contraction. Genetic abnormalities contributing to DCM are estimated to be present in about 30 to 40% of DCM patients, corresponding to an estimated prevalence of 250,000 to 500,000 people in the United States.  Further, genetic mutations of the sarcomere impair the ability of the heart muscle proteins to function effectively, leading to progressive worsening of function. 
 Dilated cardiomyopathy is a life-threatening progressive disease. Once symptoms appear, a patient’s condition typically declines steadily over the next few years. Typical symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the extremities or an irregular heartbeat. As the disease progresses, patients become increasingly debilitated and experience persistent shortness of breath, even at rest. Diastolic function, or the heart’s ability to relax and fill with blood, is also impaired because the left ventricle is already distended. The dilated left ventricle is itself deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen that may contribute to fibrosis and the risk of dangerous heart rhythm disturbances. In addition, regardless of whether symptoms have appeared, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are at risk of sudden cardiac death. 
 Current Standard of Care for Patients with Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
 There are no approved therapies that target the underlying cause of DCM.  Dilated cardiomyopathy patients are typically prescribed one or more drugs indicated for the treatment of systolic heart failure generally, such as diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists. By treating various signs and symptoms of heart disease, these drugs may reduce overall morbidity and mortality; however, none of the treatments address the underlying cause of disease or eliminate disease progression. While pharmacologic therapies developed over the past 35 years have improved both the prognosis and quality of life of DCM patients, five-year mortality rates still approach 50% in community-based studies.  Surgical or interventional options available to DCM patients include use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, a biventricular pacemaker, and in refractory patients, a left ventricular assist device and cardiac transplant.  Dilated cardiomyopathy, regardless of cause, is the most common diagnosis in patients requiring either mechanical circulatory support or a cardiac transplant. 
 Our portfolio of precision cardiovascular therapeutics includes multiple cardiac muscle activator programs aimed at increasing contraction of the heart muscle and thereby improving blood flow from the heart.  We are initially targeting precision indications in systolic heart failure and specifically, dilated cardiomyopathies.  
 Danicamtiv for DCM
 Danicamtiv is our lead activator candidate designed to increase the contractility of the heart (systolic function) with minimal or no effect on myocardial relaxation and compliance (diastolic function) by acting directly on the proteins in the heart muscle responsible for contraction. Danicamtiv is currently advancing into a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with certain genetic mutations of the cardiac sarcomere.
 An interim analysis of 26 patients with stable heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the Phase 2a clinical trial showed that danicamtiv demonstrated improvement in systolic function without impacting diastolic function. These results are consistent with data from our Phase 1 single-ascending dose studies of danicamtiv in both healthy volunteers and DCM patients. Given the favorable safety profile observed to date, the Phase 2a study has been extended to evaluate higher exposures of danicamtiv.  We anticipate presenting data from the Phase 2a clinical trial in the second quarter of 2020.
 Danicamtiv is an oral, small molecule, allosteric activator of myosin. In the heart, myosin is the motor protein that binds to actin to generate the force and movement of contraction. Danicamtiv has been shown to activate myosin-actin cross-bridge formation, thereby targeting the biomechanical defects underlying disease with the intent of improving cardiac contractility. This activity has been observed in the setting of multiple pathogenic DCM mutations, as well as in a genetically normal background.  In preclinical studies and early-stage clinical studies, danicamtiv improved myocardial contractility without impairing the heart’s ability to relax and fill. We believe this profile, increasing the heart’s contractility with minimal impact on relaxation, is distinct and differentiated from other activator or positive inotropic agents. 
 14


ACT-1 for Genetic DCM
ACT-1 is our preclinical activator program targeting DCM due to sarcomeric mutations and impaired calcium regulation. In preclinical models, our ACT-1 prototype molecules successfully increase contractility without prolonging systolic ejection time and with minimal impact on relaxation. ACT-1 is a non-myosin cardiac muscle activator intended to target a specific mutation underlying genetic forms of DCM. In preclinical studies, ACT-1 was able to increase stroke volume and systolic function with no prolongation of systolic ejection time and no significant impact on diastolic relaxation.  ACT-1 has been designed specifically for genetic DCM patient segments, which will be supported based on longitudinal studies in genetic animal models. We plan to advance ACT-1 into clinical development in 2021.
 Additional Potential Extensions of our Platform 
 We believe that the fundamental mechanisms we are targeting in the heart may have applicability in the broader heart failure population. As we accumulate data from our clinical studies and expand our knowledge of how our product candidates’ mechanisms are working within the heart, we are able to look at patient populations with similar disease characteristics and consider expanding our initial target indication.  We are successfully deploying this approach in the development of mavacamten – leveraging observations from our Phase 2 clinical trial in obstructive HCM to evaluate mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM patients and now moving into a subset of patients with HFpEF where the underlying cause of patient symptoms is similar to that of non-obstructive HCM. 
Commercial Rights to Our Portfolio
 We have discovered all of the compounds in our pipeline internally and retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our programs. We believe consolidated control over our entire portfolio will allow us to make strategic decisions about how we advance each of our therapeutic candidates in alignment with our precision medicine approach. We may enter into strategic alliances in the future for certain programs where the potential therapeutic indications do not align with our precision medicines strategy or for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories.
Intellectual Property 
 For the pharmaceutical products we develop and commercialize as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition-of-matter patents, where possible, and dosage and formulation patents, as well as manufacturing patents and method-of-use patents on novel indications for known compounds. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel biological discoveries, including new diagnostic methods and targets. We may also pursue patents with respect to our proprietary screening and drug development processes and technology. We may also seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our collaboration agreements may dictate. 
 Our patent portfolio includes five issued U.S. patents, five U.S. pending patent applications, two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, over 65 foreign patent applications and patents, all of which are exclusively owned by us, and some of which have claims relating to all of our current clinical-stage drug candidates. With respect to our lead drug candidates in the HCM program, we exclusively own two issued U.S. patents, have three pending U.S. patent applications, and own over 35 foreign patent applications and patents relating to the chemical composition of mavacamten and danicamtiv and use thereof.

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the utility patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the utility patent application. Our currently issued U.S. patents with respect to mavacamten are expected to expire in 2034, not including any extensions due to patent restoration or regulatory exclusivities. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to, the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We use third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of mavacamten, danicamtiv and MYK-224, and in 2020 will depend solely upon our CMOs due to the termination of our collaboration agreement with Sanofi. We have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs and may seek to enter into arrangements with strategic partners for later-stage development and commercialization of mavacamten and danicamtiv, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we currently rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the manufacturing relationships and activities. 
 We believe the synthesis of the drug substance for mavacamten is reliable and reproducible.  It employs readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We continue to obtain an adequate supply of the drug substance for mavacamten from our CMO to satisfy additional anticipated clinical demands. The current drug substance manufacturing process is the one we intend to use for commercial production. Process performance qualification and validation campaigns have been initiated. In addition, we believe the synthesis of the drug substance for danicamtiv is reliable and reproducible. We have obtained an adequate supply of the drug substance for danicamtiv from Sanofi, our former collaboration partner, to satisfy our immediate clinical and preclinical demands and have transferred the process to a CMO to produce additional supplies. We are developing improvements to our danicamtiv drug substance manufacturing process to enhance production capacity so that it will be adequate to meet future development and commercial demands.  We believe the process for production of MYK-224 drug substance is also sound and scalable.  The current CMO has enough supply on hand to meet the needs of Phase 1 clinical development as well as ongoing pre-clinical studies. 
 Drug product formulation development for mavacamten is complete and development for danicamtiv and MYK-224 is in progress. We have contracted with a third-party manufacturer capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing through early commercialization for mavacamten. We may identify other drug product manufacturers in the future to add additional capacity and redundancy to our supply chain. In our SAD clinical trials of mavacamten, we utilized a suspension formulation. We developed and manufactured multiple strengths of an immediate release tablet for use in the MAD and other early stage trials (including PIONEER-HCM) trial. For the EXPLORER-HCM Phase 3 study and commercialization, we have developed a refined capsule formulation and may develop alternate formulations for the adolescent and children/infant populations. We also employed a suspension formulation for the healthy volunteers SAD study of danicamtiv. We also developed an immediate release tablet formulation which is being used for the Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies in patients. We have successfully transferred danicamtiv tablet production from Sanofi to a CMO.  For future danicamtiv development and commercialization, we intend to develop a refined tablet formulation and may develop alternate formulations for the adolescent and children and infant populations.  As with the earlier programs, a suspension formulation is being used for the MYK-224 first in human studies.  Solid oral dosage form development is underway for Phase 2 clinical studies.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We believe that we can maximize the value of our products by retaining substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into collaborations for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories. 
 Our current strategy is to market our initial HCM and DCM products using a dedicated, direct sales force focused on cardiomyopathy specialists and targeted cardiologists treating HCM and DCM. These physicians include those affiliated with academic institutions, leading hospitals and medical centers as well as community cardiologists treating a significant volume of HCM and DCM patients. We believe they represent a concentrated prescriber base that can be appropriately managed with a specialty care sales model. 
 16


We are initially pursuing market approval and commercialization in the U.S.  We have also begun hiring a team based in Europe to evaluate the regulatory and market opportunity, in order to inform our commercialization plans in the European Union.  
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience, our precision medicine platform and our pioneering culture provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. 
 In the field of heart failure drug development, our principal competitors include Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis AG and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Specific to our initial drug discovery and development focus areas, we believe that Cytokinetics, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Novartis AG have ongoing programs in HCM and that Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Tenaya Therapeutics, Berlin Cures, and Zensun (Shanghai) Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd. have ongoing programs in DCM. Additionally, there may be other companies pursuing therapeutic candidates from which we face current or future competition. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. 
 A number of different regulatory agencies may have regulatory oversight, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. In the United States, these include the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state-controlled substance agencies and more. 
 Drug Development Regulation 
 Drug Development Process 
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies. In the United States, the FDA is the primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States, the EU and most foreign countries generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical, also known as nonclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials, meaning trials in human subjects, may begin in the United States, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed, and new data are collected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and/or similar requirements in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA or other regulatory authority inspection of clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or other regulatory authority review and approval of a marketing authorization application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and bears significant and inherent risk that the individual products will not exhibit the relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that we desire, if at all. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. FDA's primary objectives in reviewing an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in Phase 2 and 3, to help assure that the quality of the scientific evaluation of drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold after a trial has started. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, or to the governing authorities on a country by country basis. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB or EC must monitor the study until completed. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into a small number of patients or healthy human volunteers. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions, side effects with increasing doses and if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. These trials include controlled clinical trials initiated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are expanded, and controlled trials undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety. These clinical trials are intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and regulatory approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory agencies may also require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Progress reports related to clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and participating IRBs, and other governing authorities. IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and other governing health authorities and to investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report to the FDA within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or other governing authorities or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that human subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the 
 18


investigational product apparently lacks efficacy. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee (DMC). The DMC reviews safety information and provides recommendations to the sponsor for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. 
 A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug.  This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
 At times during the development of a new drug product, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. This commonly occurs prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice, including feedback on the next phase of development. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life and distribution pathway. There are also requirements governing the reporting of certain clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, such as clinicaltrials.gov.
 The results of drug candidate development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, requesting approval to market the drug candidate for one or more proposed indications. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee (adjusted by the FDA on an annual basis). According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2020, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is $2,942,965. For fiscal year 2020, PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee of $325,424. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it may be filed. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is granted priority review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and indication for use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter identifies deficiencies that may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 19


Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product for a serious or life-threatening condition is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 Drug candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA presently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 A drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we may receive future FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up-to-date labels, warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved label; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off-label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 
 20


Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, such as adverse events, the existence or severity of which was unknown when the product was approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, revised labeling or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, clinical trial holds, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 
 From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory or policy changes will occur or be implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost due to the FDA’s pre-market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that ingredient or the combination. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by the FDA either alone or in combination. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the compound responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric Information and Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. The FDA issues a written request for pediatric clinical trials prior to approval of an NDA only where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population.
 Under the FDCA, NDAs and certain supplements to NDAs must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), unless the drug has been granted orphan designation for the proposed indication at the time the initial PSP is required, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may 
 21


be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or the manufacturer of the product with exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, granted orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Orphan drug designation in the EU entitles the manufacturer to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 United States 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health programs, commercial or private insurance, and managed care organizations. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 22


In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists, and one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.  Many private payors, however, use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. The coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, we expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 European Union 
 In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of our drug candidates we may develop depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unlikely to use prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States. 
 In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the number of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Other Federal and State Healthcare Laws, Including Anti-Kickback, Fraud and Abuse and Health Information Privacy and Security Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, ACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 
 23


The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP) to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. 
 In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to United States government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the present state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 Effective in 2011, ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (the “donut hole”). Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap.
 Effective in 2011, ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 
 As part of efforts to further transparency of payments made by pharmaceutical companies to physicians, ACA required manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin reporting this information to CMS beginning in 2014. Annual reporting is required, and records of payments are publicly available for review on the CMS website. 
 As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to ACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
 The ACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. 
 The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Anti-Kickback Laws 
 United States federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 24


The penalties for violating the anti-kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil fines and penalties for each violation, plus imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including third-party payors. 
 Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.  The government may deem manufacturers to have caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Companies that submit claims directly to payors may also be liable under the False Claims Act for the direct submission of such claims. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
 Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual on behalf of the federal government who shares in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Further, violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the United States Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 26, 2013, impose specified requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individual identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state, and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 25


Furthermore, international laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within Europe and between European countries and the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
 There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires most pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS, under the Open Payments Program, information regarding any payments or other “transfers of value” made or distributed by that entity to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physical providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France which has adopted the Loi Bertrand, or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013, and Belgium which enacted their Sunshine Act in 2016. 
Non-U.S. Healthcare Laws 
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018). In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Regardless of FDA status for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Regulations Governing Data Collection and the Use, Processing and Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information 
 We have conducted, and may continue to conduct, clinical trials or continue to enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical trials in certain jurisdictions in which we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Further, the United Kingdom’s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. 
 26


California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted.  The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 Healthcare Reform and Regulatory Changes
 The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell our products. In the United States, there have been and continue to be laws enacted by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. By way of example, in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
 In addition, in March 2010, ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. 
 On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Tax Payer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), includes a provision that decreased the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” to $0 effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA.

Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. The Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2017, as well as the follow-on Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2018 were introduced to appropriate funds to stabilize CSR payments; however, the future of this effort is unclear. On June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax.  It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019 by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and  closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” 
 
The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing, replacing, or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal, replacement, or modification on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services. 
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Finally, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
