 Since inception, GTX has sold, developed and commercially launched numerous products, including, our GPS Smart Shoes, SmartSoles, Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) SmartSoles, hand-held GPS tracking devices, a proprietary custom military personnel and asset tracking solution, a weapons tracker, pet tracker, infant tracker and more than 20 smartphone and tablet Apps, all supported by our hosted and scalable backend monitoring platform and intellectual property portfolio. The Company has multiple lines of business units comprising of our core wearable tech SmartSole line, Military line, OEM devices and supplies, professional services, Near field Communications (NFC) asset tracking and intellectual property licensing. The business units generate various revenue streams, such as product sales, recurring subscriptions, software and intellectual property (IP) licensing, fees for custom hardware and software development, professional consulting, and support and maintenance services. Many of our products are protected by GTX’s IP portfolio of issued patents, licensed patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URLs and a library of proprietary hardware and software designs.

BUSINESS UNITS
 

1) | Wearable Technology - Our SmartSole line of wearable footwear technology is designed for people with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”). Currently that number is estimated at 100 million worldwide and expected to reach 277 million by 2050. Typically, these people tend to wander and require some wander guard technology and remote oversight. The SmartSoles are comfortable orthotic insoles embedded with a GPS and cellular tracking module, so that a caregiver can know in real time where a loved one is at the touch of a button from any smartphone or computer. Approximately 9 million people in the U.S. and over 100 million worldwide are affected with some sort of cognitive memory disorder. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Military and Custom Development - for tracking military personnel, and high value assets, such as drones, small light weight cargo, and other high value mobile assets that require our robust, small footprint and low power consumption hardware platform. 
3) | Mobile Apps – mobile and digital for the work force, such as salespersons, journalists, electricians, plumbers, food delivery, property management agents, cleaning services and other industries that require knowing the whereabouts of an employee or contractor in real time but that don’t want to invest in costly GPS devices, instead would rather leverage a user’s smartphone. 
4) | IP licensing- many of our patents were issued over 10 years ago and have garnered interest within the tech community. GTX is currently engaged in a licensing and monetization campaign. Over 150 companies that could potentially license some or all our IP have been identified. 
5) | Short Range and Logistics – our BLE and NFC technology for tracking people in designated areas, such as seniors in assisted living communities or valuable assets across the supply chain, such as expensive wines, foods or pharmaceuticals. BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC – Near Field Communication are a short-range wireless technology that triggers data exchange from one device to another. The chip is about the size of a nickel and can be attached, embedded, sewn, glued, embroidered, and even ironed on or otherwise affixed to just about any person or product, including print materials, packaging and wearables. 
6) | Medical Health & Safety devices and supplies – our wide range of protective equipment ranging from hearing assisted technology to masks, sanitizing equipment, UV sterilization equipment, and rapid test kits. 

CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
 Management’s corporate strategy is to continue to build and develop GTX as a health & safety wearable technology company that provides turnkey solutions for the consumer, enterprise, and government. Most of the GTX tracking and monitoring products are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription service plan or licensing fees ranging from $2.00 to $35.00, per month per monitored asset. In addition to product sales and recurring service fees, the Company also generates revenues through software and IP licensing. Many of our patents have filing dates going back to 2004, 2005 and 2006 and still have open continuations and our legal team is constantly identifying new companies that are a potential licensee candidate.

 As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are focused on launching new products, adding new subscribers and signing new licensing agreements so that we can build a steady base of recurring revenues. Launching new products, new vertical sales channels and building out our patent portfolio are the key drivers for growth. The more products we develop and sell the more subscribers we bring onboard. And, as our patent portfolio grows and evolves so do our licensing opportunities. To date we have built a network of strategic partners, a robust technology platform of proprietary hardware and software and a growing intellectual property (IP) portfolio. The GTX product lines of embedded smart wearable GPS devices, Stand-Alone GPS devices, Digital Apps, BLE/NFC solution, encrypted RF military personnel and asset tracking solutions and protective medical supplies and devices are sold both direct to consumer (“B2C”) and business to business (“B2B”) and direct to the Military, through our global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, non-profit organizations, government agencies, police departments, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 35 countries, with well-established customers and distributors in Canada, Mexico, Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the U.S. the Company sells direct to the consumer through its online ecommerce platform, a host of retailers and resellers along with hundreds of online affiliates. The Company also manages direct B2B enterprise and government sales through its business development team and advisors. The B2B initiatives comprise of supporting existing distributors along with bringing on new distributors, working with U.S. and Foreign Military agencies, to support existing business and secure new business, and domestically to work with local, state, and federal agencies in order to acquire reimbursement codes for its line of SmartSoles. To date GTX has been issued a vendor number for reimbursement in 11 U.S. states and internationally in Canada, Norway, Sweden and in the U.K. the National Health Services (“NHS”) began conducting regional pilots for the wander assistive GPS SmartSoles, in urban centers with high populations of seniors afflicted with dementia. Under these reimbursement programs, the SmartSoles are either partially (50% to 60%) or sometimes up to (100% including the monthly subscriptions) paid for or subsidized by the local, state or federal agencies. We have also applied for grants and private insurance reimbursement along with other health and municipal services in several other countries. Where granted, the subsidies lower the cost of acquiring and owning our tracking products, which can result in an increase in customers and revenues.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
 Smart wearable technology is becoming ubiquitous, and it is starting to find its way into all parts of the global society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, are continuing on a strong upward trajectory evident by the likes of Nike, Garmin, Google, Samsung, Apple, Verizon and a host of other fortune 100 companies that have entered into this space. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare and business use. CCS Insight (a provider of market information, data analysis and market intelligence) recently updated its outlook on the future of wearable tech, indicating that 411 million smart wearable devices, worth a staggering $34 billion, were be sold in 2020.
     Location-Based Services (LBS) and Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), published by Markets and Markets, are expected to grow from USD 16.0 billion in 2019 to USD 40.0 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 20.1%. This growth will be fueled because it is now possible for a network of physical objects (humans, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure, equipment of all shapes and types) to collect and exchange data and to communicate and work together. This enables devices, sensors and systems to operate autonomously in pursuit of goals and objectives set by the human architects of the system. We believe that accurately identifying the location of a person or assets in real time will be a key driver in many applications for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors.
     The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (“CIF”) study by the Longevity Network, used analysis and research from Parks Associates found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2020, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. This demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the next four years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers to monitor the location of elderly persons could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to the Association of American Retired Persons (AARP). Most family caregivers (67% of them) want to use technology to monitor their loved one’s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth.

 In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers wanting to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through miniaturized, low power consumption locator systems and technologies such as ours.
     The rising need for real-time location systems (RTLS) and wearable location-based services (LBS) is influenced by several factors, among them:
    
● | Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones & tablets (estimated 2 billion devices). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to global terrorism, active shootings, natural disasters and general unrest. 
● | Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, etc. approximately 9 million in U.S. and according to the World Health Organization who estimates that Alzheimer’s will reach 135 million worldwide by 2050). 
● | Corporations needing to manage worker productivity, efficiency and logistics. 
● | Government agencies, law enforcement and military need to track personnel and assets. 
● | Massive lifestyle adoption of location-based advertising and social networking. 

      GTX Management believes that more and more consumers, enterprises, and government agencies are realizing the importance of using tracking and monitoring information technology. The technology growth story has long focused on the consumer, but as enterprises in every industry sector, including the government sector, look to technology to facilitate and transform their own operations, the opportunities for technology companies have broadened considerably. The following information illustrates the ways in which various tech markets are expected to grow.
     The LBS and RTLS market has grown considerably over the past few years and is expected to grow further with increasing portable personal digital assistant (“PDA”) based e-commerce. The overall market is expected to grow from $15.04 billion in 2016 to $77.84 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 38.9%.

INTELECTUAL PROPERTY
 
 GTX’s IP portfolio not only supports the Company’s core product lines by creating barriers of entry to competitors, but also underscores the Company’s intrinsic value and generates revenues from out bound licensing. Our early investment in IP dates back to 2002 and demonstrates GTX’s commitment to developing innovative technology in the growing wearable GPS, LBS and RTLS space. The GTX IP portfolio underpins its business and provides support across all its business units. The portfolio addresses three core areas: Footwear, Communication and International coverage and as of December 31, 2020 we had twenty-three (23) patents and several trademark registrations. These include nineteen (18) issued U.S. utility patents, three of which are insole patents, two (2) issued U.S. design patents, and three (3) other pending U.S. utility patent applications. We also have three (3) issued foreign national patents which include one (1) Canadian utility patent and two (2) Mexican utility patents. We also have one (1) pending European foreign national patent application based on our U.S. filings. In addition to the five (5) comm protocol’s (program-to-program communications access methods), which falls under GTX U.S. Patent 8,760,286, commonly referred to as the 286 GTX patent family, GTX also has several patents on the device side. The international multi- pronged IP protection approach is part of the overall intellectual property strategy protecting all aspects of the GTX enterprise and value of its hardware and platform 
     GTX also has under license one (1) U.S. patent and twelve (12) foreign patents. Included under the IP portfolio GTX has U.S. trademark registrations including, but not limited to, registrations for the marks “LOCi” and “LOCIMOBILE.” In addition, another U.S. trademark application for “GPS SMART SOLE SATELLITE MONITORING AND REALTIME TRACKING”, “GTX CORP”, and “WITH YOU.”
     As part of our outbound IP licensing monetization campaign in June 2016 we signed a revenue share monetization agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy”), a subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). Inventergy engaged a highly experienced IP litigation law firm, Cotman IP Law Group in order to support our outbound IP monetization and licensing efforts. Since our portfolio extends beyond our core footwear patents and into areas such as GPS watches, fitness wearables that track location, hand-held GPS devices, tracking apps on Smartphones, standalone GPS tracking devices and location based platforms in general, which represents a very sizable addressable market and due to the large size and scope of this market, the process of identifying potential licensee’s, formulating a strategy and the negotiations or litigation required a lot of time and resources, hence why we brought in a partner. Due to the confidentiality nature of these negotiations and legal proceedings both current and in the future, Inventergy and GTX are limited in making public announcements and usually bound to confidentiality agreements. We will however, be disclosing whatever information we can in our periodic reports. Furthering our current IP monetization strategy, GTX is also exploring licensing some of its other patents that are not part of the Invenergy agreement. This is still in an early phase with only a few exploratory conversations that have taken place so far.

YEAR IN REVIEW
 
 2020 was probably our most transformative year since we launched our GPS SmartSoles in 2015. Even with the overall setbacks and the restrictive lockdowns enforced in California due to COVID, which in turn brought about a reduction in revenues, we still managed to grow our product sales, grow our customer base, expand our product lines, maintain good profit margins, and reduced our general expenses.  Except for a government assisted very low interest SBA loan, which we have 30 years to pay off, we did not take on any new debt and continued to retire our existing debt by $494K or 35% in 2020.
     Overall subscriptions were down for the year and lower than expected due to COVID-19 and because many of the cellular providers worldwide transitioned to 4G and 5G shutting down 2G and 3G in many parts of the world. Even though we had been planning for the 2G and 3G shutdown we had no way to plan for COVID.  Most of our distributors and B2B customers stopped placing new orders in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2019 in order for them to sell out of their existing inventory ahead of receiving our new 4G products. The 2G and 3G shutdown also had an impact on our B2C subscriptions as consumers were experiencing connectivity issues in certain geographical areas and suspended their subscriptions. In spite of these temporary setbacks, we saw and continue to see a steady flow of pre-orders for our 4G SmartSoles.
     Due to our pivot in early March 2020 to expand our health and safety product line into the Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) business, we saw a 109% increase in product revenues compared to 2019, added over 2,500 new customers, elevated our product and brand awareness in the U.S. and showed a modest net profit for the first three quarters of 2020. The expansion into the PPE business enabled us to maintain our cash flow, broaden our product offerings, garner a lot of new customers, all of which we believe has expanded our visibility in the marketplace, as we are starting to see more cross selling across our product lines and continue to see a noticeable increase in inquiries from our distributors for wearable tracking and monitoring solutions, which is the cornerstone of our business.

 Even though overall, revenues compared to last year were down besides COVID, most of that was directly related to IP licensing. In 2019, in addition to our normal IP licensing revenue, we had 1 large transaction for $650,000 that dramatically increased our licensing revenue for that year. However, in 2020 not only did we not have 1 large transaction, but due to COVID all our normal IP licensing revenues were off. Instead of 14 licenses signed in 2019, we only signed one in 2020.
     During the second quarter of 2020, basically starting April first, the Company was immersed in addressing the impact of COVID-19: from setting up work safety policies, social distancing guidelines, shelter in place lockdowns, contacting our customers and suppliers across the globe to address and ascertain their impact. In addition, we had to quickly expand our infrastructure to support the rapid need and demand for PPE’s. As we were facing the many uncertainties, we filed for government assistance loan programs, which we received late in the second quarter. Even with all the uncertainty, chaos and panic that ensued in early April, we managed to build out our PPE business whereby we sold and donated hundreds of thousands of PPE items to a wide range of entities such as essential businesses, assisted living facilities, pharmacies, Fortune 1,000 companies, hospitals, police departments, nonprofits, and local, state, and federal government agencies, in almost every State across the U.S. We launched a PPE specific website www.gtxmask.com, which within weeks, saw over a 500% increase in website traffic, and 300% increase in consumer orders. GTX is now well positioned as a trusted health & safety supplier for providing a wide variety of high-quality products, excellent customer service and reliable same or next day shipping, all of which is contributing to an increase in our brand awareness and favorable customer testimonials and reviews. Since we are now addressing a much larger potential audience, we started an advertising campaign, and based on the results so far, we expect to keep the campaign going into 2021.
     Continuing throughout the year, our e commerce business saw a steady monthly increase and many of the new products we introduced were widely accepted and sales quickly ramped up throughout the year, seeing a significant increase in sales coming from COVID Rapid Test Kits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020.
     During the third quarter of 2020, GTX was issued a new patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), U.S Patent No. 10,743,615 entitled “System and Method for Embedding A Tracking Device in a Footwear Insole.” This is GTX’s third patent related to embedding Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) GPS wearable tracking technology into footwear. This patent covers different aspects of the GPS SmartSole product and we expect to receive more patents covering other aspects on related applications in the future as we continue to expand our IP portfolio in the wearable technology space, especially as the global wearable medical device market continues to grow and expecting to reach $9.4 billion by 2022. This third patent helps solidify our portfolio with respect to wearable tracking and monitoring technologies embedded in footwear.
     During the fourth quarter of 2020 we continued making progress with the development of our next generation miniaturized GPS tracking device, which will utilize a host of new technologies, including CatM1, NB-IoT, enhanced Wifi, and Bluetooth, for better accuracy, faster location requests and less power consumption. This new hardware platform will be small enough to be embedded into our line of wearable technology and offered as a licensed hardware platform as well. Unfortunately, we found some issues with our first design, which were quickly resolved, and we put a second version of prototypes in production, which we began testing in the 4th quarter. The demand for our GPS SmartSoles is the highest it has been in over two years, so we are very focused and committed to getting our new product launched in 2021. Subscriptions which directly tie into the sales of our tracking products were still not back to pre-COVID as of December 31, 2020, however based on our preorders going into 2021 we expect subscriptions to start ramping up quickly as soon as we launch our new 4G SmartSoles. We also had a slight increase in IP licensing as the economy began to reopen up towards the 3rd quarter, but then we had the end of year spike in COVID cases which slowed things down again with our IP campaign. IP revenues were significantly lower in 2020 over the previous year and even though we believe the setbacks were related to COVID, we also believe our IP campaign which began with our partnership with Inventergy needs to be revamped as we go into 2021 and management will be exploring several different options.
     Since we cannot accurately predict how long the PPE business will remain in strong demand, based on the current events, it is unlikely to end completely before the end of the year. The entry into this business has enabled us to broaden our product line, garner thousands of new customers, all of which we believe has expanded our visibility in the wearable technology GPS tracking space as we are starting to see cross selling across our product lines. We have seen a noticeable increase in inquiries from our distributors for wearable tracking, monitoring, and tracking solutions, which is the cornerstone of our business. We intend to leverage the increase in customers and brand awareness to introduce new products in 2021.
     As we look over the horizon into 2021, we are cautiously optimistic, seeing encouraging signs, hearing from many customers that they are almost fully operational, but the situation still remains fluid. One thing is for certain, there is a big desire for innovation and new solutions in the wearable technology healthcare industry post COVID-19 era, along with continued demand for PPE while the pandemic is still not fully under control. GTX has been at the forefront of many innovative technologies, we pivoted early into the PPE business and built an entire new business unit under extremely challenging conditions, so we know we are resilient, confident and will continue to push forward.
     We want to thank our entire team and everyone in our inner circle for working tirelessly throughout 2020 under extremely challenging circumstances. For now, we will keep updating everyone as best we can through our podcast, press releases and newsletters and wish everyone a safe and healthy journey into 2021.

TECHNOLOGY


 GTX has developed a “carrier-class” architecture and no longer needs to host the servers in a facility Data Center. Throughout 2020 most of our servers were migrated to the cloud which enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.
     Our current location tracking product design utilizes quad-band GSM/GPRS telephony chip sets and can be adapted to the prevalent GSM/GPRS wireless technologies. Our modules utilize advanced “weak signal server-enhanced” technology which provide rapid location identification. Each module is programmed with a unique identification number and uses standard cellular frequencies to communicate its location. The module is also programmed with a unique subscriber identification number allowing each owner to subscribe to different services.
     We continue to modify and upgrade our modules for our SmartSoles and other GPS tracking products. The production and roll-out of version 4 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a benefit because, unlike the earlier versions, we will no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors, so our manufacturing cost and timelines are reduced, and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers’ requirements. Also, we now can bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to produce a product that can be delivered to foreign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber). Our core tracking products (SmartSole, Take-Along-Tracker, OEM modules and Track my Work Force App) are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. Our personal locator modules have the ability to operate on the networks of 290 carriers in over 210 countries.

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS and LICENSING
 
 We offer location-based hardware and/or IoT data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location-based products/services in various vertical markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long-term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each third parties core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies. We can customize our products into different form factors for the specific needs of customers. To date, the Company has created custom solutions for the monitoring of seniors with cognitive memory disorders by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed toys, belts, insoles and backpacks; and the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones, long guns and other mobile assets.
     The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare (which manufactures our SmartSoles), Spline (our engineering firm), Telic (which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics) and Telefonica (which provides our global connectivity). On the distribution side, we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.

RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT
 
 As an emerging tech company our long-term growth is predicated on making investments in R&D and Intellectual Property. This year we took the opportunity to invest in our future, by ramping up NFC, BLE and 4G development projects. We are integrating our NFC tags with Blockchain technology and started developing a secured, scalable middleware layer that sits in-between our NFC devices and third-party backend platforms. We started working with several partners that provide various vertical specific Block chain, IoT and AI backend platforms but needed a secure and seamless flow of data from hardware to backend. This middleware lawyer is industry agnostic and is designed to help drive NFC hardware business and other IoT device sales. We also continued testing our Near Field Communication (NFC) Temperature Trackers, which provide real-time temperature sensing and data logging across the supply chain necessary with transportation of perishables; food, drinks, pharmaceuticals and other temperature sensitive products that can be negatively affected by conditions in transit. This is still a new business silo that has not begun generating revenue but we see this new technology as a natural extension into the world of asset tracking, taking us beyond humans to tracking and monitoring of perishable shipments of food, beverages, biopharmaceuticals, live organs and many other temperature sensitive shipments. In addition to temperature sensing we are now looking into NFC tags that can authenticate products, addressing the multibillion dollar worldwide counterfeit market.GROWTH STRATEGY
 
 We have developed a multi-prong business model approach; business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), Government and Military sales, and licensing of our technology and IP. We have successfully proven out all our models in a small scale. With B2C, we continue to invest in e-commerce and once we can hit critical mass with lower pricing, we will expand into the mass consumer markets. With B2B our strategy is to establish more partners and relationships with key industry leaders who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. In addition, we plan to continue working with the Military both in the U.S. and abroad. Lastly, we plan to continue to identify companies that can license our IP. This approach requires time and capital to grow, however it is also diversified so that all our eggs are not in one basket and once scaled can show rapid growth. As a growing underfinanced company, we have managed to prove out our business models and now need to scale. Management believes that once we have the resources to scale any of these models or all of them, we can expect to see steady and sustainable growth.
     Key elements of our growth strategy include:
    
● | Providing our Personal Locator hardware module to licensees to empower their products with our two-way GPS tracking capabilities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OEM private label manufacturing; 
● | A mass market retail price under $99.00 for Personal Location devices; 
● | A monthly service fee structure, under $20.00; 
● | Reduction in hardware size and cost in order to open new markets; 
● | Continue expanding our medical reimbursement programs; 
● | Rolling out bio metrics and NFC; 
● | Expanding distribution channels; 
● | Increasing the number of solutions for the military and law enforcement markets; 
● | Ease of use at the location interface point as well as with the device, using state-of-the-art cloud computing and cloud application development and; 
● | Expanding our IP monetization campaign. 

COMPETITION
 
 Personal location and asset tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from numerous vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Furthermore, many of the location products and services are available at no cost to the user or are already included in other products. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of the tracking solutions that we offer represents an opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio and first to market. Another key competitive advantage is our large and growing patent portfolio along with our ability, because we are a small company, to be agile and responsive while still having deep and long industry knowledge of the GPS space.

 Key differentiators between ourselves and the competition is:
     B2B:
    
● | Providing a comprehensive fully integrated, patented end-to-end solution comprised of hardware, software, and global connectivity, that can be embedded or OEM into other companies’ product lines. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Being small and nimble we can provide faster turnaround times and lower pricing, which has been a key advantage in our military business. 

      B2C:
    
● | Our BLE & GPS SmartSole is the only non-visible, non-intrusive tracking and monitoring solution.

      There are numerous competitors for GPS products in general, and for our LOCiMOBILE® smart phone applications, including Location Based Technologies, Inc., Google Latitude, Foursquare, Trimble Navigation, Inc., Brick House Security, Verizon, and Trackimo, Inc. Many of our competitors are better financed than we are and/or have greater marketing and scientific resources than we can provide. We are also aware of a number of domestic and foreign competitors that offer much lower quality products in order to gain market share. The U.S. Government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change due to new requirements and budget allocation. We compete with a large number of military suppliers and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. Government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating and technological resources than we have. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. In the government services sector our competition includes large systems integrators and defense contractors. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies such as, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. However so far being small and nibble along with our ability to deliver product and services, quickly, at a fair market price and customize products on demand, have been to our advantage, over many larger competitors.
