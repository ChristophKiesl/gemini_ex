Item 1. Business
The consolidated financial statements of EQM have been retrospectively recast to include the pre-acquisition results of EQM Olympus Midstream LLC (EQM Olympus), Strike Force Midstream Holdings LLC (Strike Force) and EQM West Virginia Midstream LLC (EQM WV), which were acquired by EQM effective on May 1, 2018 (the Drop-Down Transaction), and RMP, which was acquired by EQM effective on July 23, 2018 (the EQM-RMP Merger), because these transactions were between entities under common control. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "EQM" refer to EQM in its individual capacity or to EQM and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "Equitrans Midstream" refer to Equitrans Midstream Corporation in its individual capacity or to Equitrans Midstream and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.
Overview of Operations
EQM Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: EQM) is a growth-oriented limited partnership that operates, acquires and develops midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQM is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S. and holds a significant transmission footprint in the Appalachian Basin. EQM provides midstream services to its customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio through its three primary assets: the gathering system, which delivers natural gas from wells and other receipt points to transmission pipelines; the transmission and storage system, which delivers natural gas to local demand users and long-haul interstate pipelines for access to demand markets; and the water service system, which consists of water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities that support well completion activities and collect flowback and produced water for recycling or disposal.
As of December 31, 2019, EQM provided a majority of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services under long-term, firm contracts that generally include fixed monthly reservation fees. At the EQT Global GGA Effective Time, the 15-year EQT Global GGA superseded 14 gathering agreements with EQT that provided for firm reservation fees under firm contracts and a new 3.0 Bcf per day MVC, which increases gradually after the in-service date of the MVP project. This contract structure enhances the stability of EQM's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 58% of EQM's revenues were generated from firm reservation fees. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, EQM's firm gathering contracts and firm transmission and storage contracts had weighted average remaining terms of approximately 11 years and 14 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.
EQM's operations are focused primarily in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southeastern Ohio, which are strategic locations in the natural gas shale plays known as the Marcellus and Utica Shales. These regions are also the primary operating areas of EQT, EQM's largest customer and a related party as of December 31, 2019. EQT accounted for approximately 69% of EQM's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The following is a map of EQM's gathering, transmission and storage and water services operations as of December 31, 2019.
2019 Developments

• | Average daily gathering throughput volumes increased 20.9% from 6,489 BBtu per day for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 7,844 BBtu per day for the year ended December 31, 2019 due largely to the Bolt-on Acquisition described below.


• | EQM IDR Transaction. On February 22, 2019, Equitrans Midstream and EQM completed a simplification transaction pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 13, 2019 (the IDR Merger Agreement), by and among Equitrans Midstream, EQM and certain related parties, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Equitrans Merger Sub, LP, a party to the IDR Merger Agreement, merged with and into EQGP (the Merger) with EQGP continuing as the surviving limited partnership and a wholly-owned subsidiary of EQM following the Merger, and (ii) each of (a) the IDRs in EQM, (b) the economic portion of the general partner interest in EQM and (c) the issued and outstanding EQGP common units representing limited partner interests in EQGP were canceled, and, as consideration for such cancellation, certain affiliates of Equitrans Midstream received on a pro rata basis 80,000,000 newly-issued EQM common units and 7,000,000 newly-issued Class B units (Class B units), both representing limited partner interests in EQM, and EQGP Services, LLC retained the non-economic general partner interest in EQM (the EQM IDR Transaction). Additionally, as part of the EQM IDR Transaction, the 21,811,643 EQM common units held by EQGP were canceled and 21,811,643 EQM common units were issued pro rata to certain affiliates of Equitrans Midstream. See Note 6 for further information on the EQM IDR Transaction and Class B Units. As a result of the EQM IDR Transaction, EQGP Services, LLC (the EQM General Partner) replaced EQM Midstream Services, LLC as our new general partner. See Note 19 related to the treatment of the Class B units in connection with the EQM Merger.


• | Bolt-on Acquisition. On March 13, 2019, EQM entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with North Haven Infrastructure Partners II Buffalo Holdings, LLC (NHIP), an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, pursuant to which EQM acquired from NHIP a 60% Class A interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream) and a 100% interest in Hornet Midstream Holdings, LLC (Hornet Midstream) (collectively, the Bolt-on Acquisition). At the time of the acquisition, Eureka Midstream owned a 190-mile gathering header pipeline system in Ohio and West Virginia that services both dry Utica and wet Marcellus Shale production. Hornet Midstream owns a 15-mile, high-pressure gathering system in West Virginia that connects to the Eureka Midstream system. The Bolt-on Acquisition closed on April 10, 2019. See Note 2 for further information on the Bolt-on Acquisition.


• | Series A Preferred Unit issuance. On March 13, 2019, EQM entered into a Convertible Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (inclusive of certain Joinder Agreements entered into on March 18, 2019, the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement) with certain investors to issue and sell in a private placement (the Private Placement) an aggregate of 24,605,291 Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Units (Series A Preferred Units) representing limited partner interests in EQM for a cash purchase price of $48.77 per Series A Preferred Unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. The net proceeds from the Private Placement were used in part to fund the purchase price in the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, and the remainder was used for general partnership purposes. The Private Placement closed concurrently with the closing of the Bolt-on Acquisition on April 10, 2019. See Notes 1 and 6 for further information regarding the Series A Preferred Units. See Note 19 related to the treatment of the Series A Preferred Units in connection with the EQM Merger.


• | 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. In August 2019, EQM entered into a term loan agreement that provided for unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion (the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement). The initial term loans provided under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement mature in August 2022. EQM received net proceeds from the issuance of the initial term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement of $1,397.4 million, inclusive of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay borrowings under EQM's $3 billion revolving credit facility (the $3 Billion Facility) and the remainder was used for general partnership purposes. See Note 12 for further information on the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement.

The Water Services Letter Agreement is effective as of the first day of the first month following the MVP in-service date and shall expire on the fifth anniversary of such date. During each year of the Water Services Letter Agreement, EQT agreed that fees incurred to EQM for services pursuant to the Water Services Letter Agreement shall be equal to or greater than $60 million per year.
Intercompany Loan Agreement
Equitrans Midstream intends to enter into a senior unsecured term loan agreement (the Intercompany Loan Agreement) by and between EQM, as lender, and Equitrans Midstream, as borrower, pursuant to which Equitrans Midstream will borrow the stated principal amount of $650 million (the Intercompany Loan) from EQM. The Intercompany Loan Agreement is expected to close in early March 2020 and has an anticipated maturity date in March 2023. It is anticipated that EQM will have the option to accelerate the maturity of the Intercompany Loan upon Equitrans Midstream's failure to pay interest and other obligations as they become due (subject to certain specified grace periods) and upon other customary events of default. It is anticipated that interest on the Intercompany Loan thereunder will accrue and will be payable semi-annually in arrears starting in September 2020 at an interest rate of 7.0% per annum, subject to an additional 2.0% per annum during the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default. See Note 18 for a description of the Intercompany Loan. EQM expects to borrow under its $3 Billion Facility (as defined in Note 12) in order to source funds for making the loan to Equitrans Midstream in connection with the Intercompany Loan Agreement.
Preferred Restructuring Agreement
On February 26, 2020, Equitrans Midstream and EQM entered into a Preferred Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring Agreement) with all of the holders of Series A Preferred Units (collectively, the Investors), pursuant to which (i) EQM will redeem $600 million of the Investor’s Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the EQM Merger and (ii) the remaining portion of the Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the EQM Merger will be exchanged for Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares on a one for one basis (the Equitrans Midstream Private Placement), in each case, in connection with the occurrence of the “Series A Change of Control” (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) that will occur upon the closing of the EQM Merger (the Restructuring). The Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares to be issued in the Equitrans Midstream Private Placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
The Restructuring is expected to close substantially concurrent with the closing of the EQM Merger (the Restructuring Closing), subject to the delivery of certain closing deliverables and certain closing conditions. See Note 19 for additional information on the Restructuring Agreement and the Equitrans Midstream Private Placement.
Share Purchase Agreements
On February 26, 2020, Equitrans Midstream entered into two share purchase agreements (the Share Purchase Agreements) with EQT, pursuant to which (i) Equitrans Midstream will purchase 4,769,496 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Cash Shares) from EQT in exchange for approximately $46 million in cash, (ii) Equitrans Midstream will purchase 20,530,256 shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock (the Rate Relief Shares and, together with the Cash Shares, the Share Purchases) from EQT in exchange for a promissory note (the Rate Relief Note) representing approximately $196 million in aggregate principal amount, and (iii) Equitrans Midstream will pay to EQT cash in the amount of approximately $7 million. At the Share Purchase Closing, (as defined in Note 19), EQT will assign the Rate Relief Note to EQM as consideration for certain commercial terms, including potential reductions in the gathering fees, contemplated in the EQT Global GGA. See Note 19 for additional information on the Share Purchase Agreements.
Business Segments
EQM reports its operations in three segments that reflect its three lines of business: Gathering, Transmission and Water. These segments include all of EQM's operations. For discussion of the composition of the three segments, see Notes 1 and 7.
The three business segments correspond to EQM's three primary assets: the gathering system, transmission and storage system and water system. The following table summarizes the composition of EQM's operating revenue by business segment.

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Gathering operating revenues | 71 | % | | 67 | % | 57 | %
Transmission operating revenues | 24 | % | | 26 | % | 42 | %
Water operating revenues | 5 | % | | 7 | % | 1 | %

EQM's Assets 
12

Gathering assets. As of December 31, 2019, EQM's gathering system, inclusive of Eureka Midstream's gathering system, included approximately 990 miles of high-pressure gathering lines and 130 compressor units with compression of approximately 445,000 horsepower and multiple interconnect points with EQM's transmission and storage system and other interstate pipelines. EQM's gathering system also included approximately 920 miles of FERC-regulated, low-pressure gathering lines. During the third quarter of 2019, EQM divested certain of its FERC-regulated low-pressure gathering pipelines associated with its Copley gathering system located in West Virginia. See Note 2 for further discussion.
Transmission and Storage assets. As of December 31, 2019, EQM's transmission and storage system included approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated, interstate pipelines that have interconnect points to seven interstate pipelines and multiple LDCs. As of December 31, 2019, the transmission and storage system was supported by 39 compressor units, with total throughput capacity of approximately 4.4 Bcf per day and compression of approximately 135,000 horsepower, and 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs, which had a peak withdrawal capacity of approximately 900 MMcf per day and a working gas capacity of approximately 43 Bcf. 
Water assets. As of December 31, 2019, EQM's water system included approximately 180 miles of pipeline that deliver fresh water from the Monongahela River, the Ohio River, local reservoirs and several regional waterways. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the water system assets included 28 fresh water impoundment facilities. 
Strategy
EQM’s assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of EQM’s assets provide a key link between supply and major demand markets in the U.S. EQM is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on produced volumes as of December 31, 2019. EQM maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 58% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated by firm reservation fees.
EQM’s principal strategy is to achieve the scale and scope of a top-tier midstream company by leveraging its existing assets and planned growth projects and seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities, while maintaining disciplined capital spending and operating cost control. As part of its approach to organic growth, EQM is focused on building and completing its key transmission and gathering growth projects outlined below, many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity commitments. Additionally, EQM is targeting growth from volumetric gathering and transmission and storage opportunities and from its water services business, which is complementary to its gathering business and potentially creates opportunities to expand EQM's existing asset footprint. EQM’s focus on execution of its organic projects, coupled with disciplined capital spending and operating cost control, is complemented by EQM’s willingness to seek, evaluate and execute on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities. EQM believes that this approach will enable EQM to achieve its strategic goals.
On February 27, 2020, EQM announced its intention to reduce its quarterly distribution from $1.16 per unit to $0.3875 per unit, a decrease of approximately 67% per unit, in connection with the announcement of the EQM Merger, commencing with the first quarter 2020 distribution. The decrease in EQM's quarterly distribution reflects a financial and distribution policy that is designed to deliver highly predictable revenues and substantial cash flows after total capital expenditures and distributions. 
EQM expects that the following expansion projects will be its primary organic growth drivers:

• | Mountain Valley Pipeline. The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture among EQM and affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Con Edison, AltaGas Ltd. and RGC Resources, Inc. that is tasked with constructing the MVP. As of December 31, 2019, EQM owned a 45.5% interest in the MVP project and will operate the MVP. The MVP is an estimated 300-mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas interstate pipeline with a targeted capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day that will span from EQM's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia, providing access to the growing southeast demand markets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM made capital contributions of approximately $755 million to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP project. In 2020, EQM expects to make capital contributions of approximately $650 million to $700 million to the MVP Joint Venture for purposes of the MVP. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms and additional shippers have expressed interest in the MVP project. The MVP Joint Venture is evaluating an expansion opportunity that could add approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of capacity through the installation of incremental compression and is also evaluating other future pipeline extension projects.

In October 2017, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the MVP. In the first quarter of 2018, the MVP Joint Venture received limited notice to proceed with certain construction activities from the FERC and commenced construction. As discussed under "The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is challenging, and recent decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending 
13

proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the projected time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects" included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Inherent in Our Business," there are pending legal and regulatory challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project that must be resolved before the MVP project can be completed. The MVP Joint Venture is working through several alternatives to resolve these challenges, including through a land exchange proposal submitted to the federal government. In connection with the United States Supreme Court’s determination to accept the Cowpasture River Preservation Association case (see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings”) and the resolution of remaining legal and regulatory components, EQM is targeting a late 2020 full in-service date at an overall project cost of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC. EQM is expected to fund approximately $2.7 billion (inclusive of the Con Edison cap described below) of the overall project cost, including approximately $105 million to $120 million in excess of EQM's ownership interest. See the discussion of the litigation and regulatory-related delays effecting the completion of the MVP set forth in "Item 3. Legal Proceedings."
On November 4, 2019, Con Edison exercised an option to cap its investment in the MVP project at approximately $530 million (excluding AFUDC). EQM and NextEra Energy, Inc. are obligated, and RGC Resources, Inc., another member of the MVP Joint Venture owning an interest in the MVP project, has opted to fund the shortfall in Con Edison's capital contributions, on a pro rata basis. As a result, EQM expects to fund an additional $86 million (excluding AFUDC) in capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture. Any funding by EQM and other members will correspondingly increase their respective interests in the MVP project and decrease Con Edison's interest in the MVP project. As a result, EQM's ownership equity in the MVP project will progressively increase from 45.5% to approximately 47.0%.

• | Wellhead Gathering Expansion and Hammerhead Projects. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM invested approximately $785 million in gathering expansion projects. In 2020, EQM expects to invest approximately $500 million in gathering expansion projects (inclusive of expected capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream), including the continued gathering infrastructure expansion of core development areas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales, in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia, for EQT, Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources) and other producers, and the Hammerhead project, a 1.6 Bcf per day gathering header pipeline that is primarily designed to connect natural gas produced in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the MVP and is supported by a 20-year term, 1.2 Bcf per day, firm capacity commitment from EQT. The Hammerhead project is expected to cost approximately $555 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM invested approximately $300 million in the Hammerhead project. The Hammerhead project is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2020 and will provide interruptible service until the MVP is placed in-service, at which time the firm capacity commitment will begin. The Hammerhead project has a targeted full in-service date of late 2020.


• | MVP Southgate Project. In April 2018, the MVP Joint Venture announced the MVP Southgate project, a proposed 75-mile interstate pipeline that will extend from the MVP at Pittsylvania County, Virginia to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance Counties, North Carolina. The MVP Southgate project is backed by a 300 MMcf per day firm capacity commitment from Dominion Energy North Carolina. As designed, the MVP Southgate project has expansion capabilities that could provide up to 900 MMcf per day of total capacity. The MVP Southgate project is estimated to cost a total of approximately $450 million to $500 million, which is expected to be spent primarily in 2020 and 2021. EQM is expected to fund approximately $225 million of the overall project cost. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM made capital contributions of approximately $19 million to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project. In 2020, EQM expects to make capital contributions of approximately $50 million to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP Southgate project. EQM will operate the MVP Southgate pipeline and, as of December 31, 2019, owned a 47.2% interest in the MVP Southgate project. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP Southgate certificate application to the FERC in November 2018. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the MVP Southgate project was issued on February 14, 2020. The schedule also identifies May 14, 2020 as the deadline for other agencies to act on other federal authorizations required for the project (the FERC, however, is not subject to this deadline). Subject to approval by the FERC and other regulatory agencies, the MVP Southgate project is expected to be placed in-service in 2021.


• | Transmission Expansion. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM invested approximately $45 million in transmission expansion projects. In 2020, EQM expects to invest approximately $60 million in transmission expansion projects, primarily attributable to the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC), the Equitrans, L.P. Expansion project (EEP), which is designed to provide north-to-south capacity on the mainline Equitrans, L.P. system, including for deliveries to the MVP, and power plant projects. A portion of EEP commenced operations with interruptible service in the third quarter of 2019. EEP will provide capacity of approximately 600 MMcf per day and offers access to several markets through interconnects with Texas Eastern Transmission, Dominion Transmission and Columbia Gas

14

Transmission. EEP will also provide delivery into the MVP and once the MVP is placed in service, firm transportation agreements for 550 MMcf per day of capacity will commence under 20-year terms. EEP has a targeted full in-service date of late 2020. 

• | Water Expansion. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, EQM invested approximately $37 million in the expansion of its fresh water delivery infrastructure. In 2020, EQM expects to invest approximately $20 million in the expansion of its fresh water delivery infrastructure in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Our Relationship with Equitrans Midstream
As a result of the Separation, Equitrans Midstream replaced EQT as our ultimate parent. Unlike EQT, Equitrans Midstream is a pure-play midstream company whose only cash-generating assets are its ownership interests in EQM. 
 Markets and Customers
EQM's two largest customers are EQT and its affiliates and PNG Companies LLC and its affiliates. EQT, the largest natural gas producer in the United States based on produced volumes as of December 31, 2019, accounted for approximately 69%, 74% and 74% of EQM's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, PNG Companies LLC and its affiliates, an LDC, accounted for approximately 7%, 7% and 11%, respectively, of EQM's total revenues, substantially all of which was included in Transmission.
Gathering Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, EQT accounted for approximately 72% of Gathering's revenues. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, as of December 31, 2019, Gathering had acreage dedications (inclusive of acreage dedications to Eureka Midstream) through which EQM has the right to elect to gather all natural gas produced from wells under an area covering (i) approximately 244,000 gross acres in Pennsylvania pursuant to agreements with certain affiliates of EQT and other third parties, (ii) approximately 344,000 gross acres in Ohio pursuant to agreements with certain affiliates of EQT and other third parties and (iii) approximately 50,000 gross acres in West Virginia. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, Gathering had an acreage dedication of approximately 12,000 gross acres, with a producer option to expand towards approximately 30,000 gross acres, in Pennsylvania, pursuant to which EQM had the right to provide a proposal to gather all natural gas provided from wells under that area. On February 26, 2020, EQT and affiliates of EQT and EQM entered into the EQT Global GGA, consolidating  of the gas gathering agreements between EQT and EQM into a single global gas gathering agreement.  See “EQT Global GGA” in Note 19 for additional information.
EQM provides gathering services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and can include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline access. Revenues under firm reservation fees also include fixed volumetric charges under MVCs. As of December 31, 2019, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 4.4 Bcf per day, which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 1.0 Bcf per day associated with EQM's high-pressure header pipelines. Including future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, the gathering system had total contracted firm reservation capacity (including contracted MVCs) of approximately 6.2 Bcf per day as of December 31, 2019, which included contracted firm reservation capacity of approximately 2.2 Bcf per day associated with EQM's high-pressure header pipelines. Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for each firm volume gathered as well as for volumes gathered in excess of the firm contracted volume, if system capacity exists. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, EQM's firm gathering contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 11 years as of December 31, 2019.
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas gathered and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline. These contracts can be short- or long-term. On EQM's low-pressure FERC-regulated gathering system, the typical gathering agreement provides interruptible service and has a one-year term with month-to-month rollover provisions terminable upon at least 30 days' notice. The rates for gathering service on the FERC-regulated system are based on the maximum posted tariff rate and assessed on actual receipts into the gathering system.
EQM generally does not take title to the natural gas gathered for its customers but retains a percentage of wellhead gas receipts to recover natural gas used to power its compressor stations and meet other requirements on EQM's low- and high-pressure gathering systems.
Transmission Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, EQT accounted for approximately 65% of Transmission's throughput and approximately 56% of Transmission's revenues. As of December 31, 2019, Transmission had an acreage dedication from EQT through which EQM had the right to elect to transport all gas produced from wells drilled by EQT under an area covering approximately 60,000 acres in Allegheny, Washington and Greene Counties in Pennsylvania and Wetzel, 
Marion, Taylor, Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison and Lewis Counties in West Virginia. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PNG Companies, LLC and its affiliates accounted for approximately 27% of Transmission's revenues. Other customers include LDCs, marketers, producers and commercial and industrial users. EQM's transmission and storage system provides customers with access to adjacent markets in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio and to the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Gulf Coast markets through interconnect points with major interstate pipelines.
EQM provides transmission and storage services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. Firm service contracts are typically long-term and can include firm reservation fees, which are fixed, monthly charges for the guaranteed reservation of pipeline and storage capacity. Volumetric-based fees can also be charged under firm contracts for firm volume transported or stored as well as for volumes transported or stored in excess of the firm contracted volume, if there is system capacity. Customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of the firm contracted volume as such volumes have the same priority as interruptible service. Including future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm transmission contracts, approximately 5.3 Bcf per day of transmission capacity, excluding 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments associated with the MVP, and 29.6 Bcf of storage capacity were subscribed under firm transmission and firm storage contracts, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which EQM has executed firm contracts, EQM's firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 14 years as of December 31, 2019.
Interruptible service contracts include volumetric-based fees, which are charges for the volume of natural gas transported and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline or storage facility. These contracts can be short- or long-term. Customers with interruptible service contracts are not assured capacity or service on the transmission and storage systems. To the extent that capacity reserved by customers with firm service contracts is not fully used or excess capacity exists, the transmission and storage systems can allocate capacity to interruptible services. EQM generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 96% of Transmission's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. Approximately 4% of Transmission's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed at discounted rates under its tariff, which are less than the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff. Transmission did not have any contracted firm transmission capacity subscribed at recourse rates under its tariff, which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff. 
Water Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, EQT accounted for approximately 89% of Water's revenues. EQM has the exclusive right to provide fluid handling services to certain EQT operated wells until December 22, 2029 (and thereafter such right continues on a month-to-month basis) within areas of dedication in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio, including the delivery of fresh water for well completion operations and the collection and recycling or disposal of flowback and produced water. EQM also provides water services to other customers operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. EQM's water service revenues are primarily generated under variable price per volume contracts. The fees charged by EQM are generally tiered and, thus, are lower on a per gallon basis once certain thresholds are met. See also “Water Services Letter Agreement” in Note 19 for additional information.
Competition
Key competitors for new natural gas gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. When compared to EQM or its customers, some of EQM's competitors have greater capital resources and access to, or control of, larger natural gas supplies.
Competition for natural gas transmission and storage is primarily based on rates, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies. EQM's principal competitors in its transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. In addition, EQM competes with companies that are building high-pressure gathering facilities that are able to transport natural gas to interstate pipelines without being subject to FERC jurisdiction. Major natural gas transmission companies that compete with EQM also have storage facilities connected to their transmission systems that compete with certain of EQM's storage facilities.
Key competition for water services include natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing EQM's water services assets and other natural gas midstream companies that offer water services. EQM's ability to attract customers to its water service business depends on its ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Regulatory Environment
FERC Regulation. EQM's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the NGPA and regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of EQM's gathering operations are also rate-regulated by the FERC in connection with its interstate transmission operations. EQM's FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates, cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to its customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to:
•rates and charges for EQM's natural gas transmission and storage and FERC-regulated gathering services;
•certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities;
•abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities and certificated gathering facilities;
•maintenance of accounts and records;
•relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates;
•terms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers;
•depreciation and amortization policies;
•acquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and
•initiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.
The FERC regulates the rates and charges for transmission and storage in interstate commerce. Under the NGA, recourse rates charged by interstate pipelines must be just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
The recourse rate that EQM may charge for its services is established through the FERC's cost-of-service ratemaking process. Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of providing that service including recovery of and a return on the pipeline's actual prudent historical cost of investment. Key determinants in the ratemaking process include the depreciated capital costs of the facilities, the costs of providing service, the allowed rate of return and income tax allowance, as well as volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions. On March 15, 2018, the FERC issued an order generally disallowing master limited partnership (MLP)-owned pipelines from including an allowance for investor income tax liability in their cost-of-service based recourse rates. Under its prior policy, the FERC had permitted all interstate pipelines to include an income tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated recourse rates. The new policy did not establish a binding rule automatically disallowing income tax allowances in current FERC-approved rates, but rather provided notice of the FERC’s general policy and intended course of action in future proceedings. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order directed at natural gas pipelines that clarified its March 15, 2018 order, stating that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance based on a demonstration that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a “double-recovery of investors’ income tax costs.” The July 18, 2018 order also clarified the treatment of ADIT. Challenges to these orders are currently pending in a consolidated proceeding before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2018, an intervenor filed a motion to hold the proceeding in abeyance. On October 24, 2018, the FERC filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding. On January 31, 2019, the court denied the motion to hold the proceeding in abeyance and ordered that the motion to dismiss be referred to the panel to which the merits proceeding is assigned. Briefing on the merits concluded on February 19, 2020, and the court scheduled oral argument for April 3, 2020. EQM cannot currently predict when the court will act on the broader proceeding, or what actions the court may take. 
Also, on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued Order No. 849, adopting regulations requiring that natural gas pipelines make a one-time report, Form 501-G. For MLP-owned pipelines, the Form 501-G report was to calculate, among other things, an earned rate of return on equity that addresses any potential over-recovery of their cost of service arising from the general disallowance of the income tax allowance and the ADIT clarification. On December 28, 2018, Equitrans, L.P., EQM's FERC-regulated subsidiary, filed its Form 501-G with the FERC. During the second quarter of 2019, EQM reached a settlement related to this FERC Form 501-G report which was focused solely on EQM’s FERC-regulated transmission and storage assets. The FERC approved the settlement and terminated Equitrans, L.P.’s Form No. 501-G proceeding during the second quarter of 2019.
The maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are generally (unless market-based rates have been approved by the FERC) set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Rate design and the allocation of costs also can affect a pipeline's profitability. While the ratemaking process establishes the maximum rate that can be charged, interstate pipelines such as EQM's transmission and storage system are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to a specified minimum level, provided they do not unduly discriminate. In addition, pipelines are allowed to negotiate different rates with their customers, under certain circumstances. Changes to rates or terms 
and conditions of service, and contracts can be proposed by a pipeline company under Section 4 of the NGA, or the existing interstate transmission and storage rates or terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by a complaint filed by interested persons including customers, state agencies or the FERC under Section 5 of the NGA. Rate increases proposed by a pipeline may be allowed to become effective subject to refund and/or a period of suspension, while rates or terms and conditions of service that are the subject of a complaint under Section 5 of the NGA are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Rate increases proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be challenged and such increases may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. Any successful challenge against existing or proposed rates charged for EQM's transmission and storage services could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.
EQM's interstate pipeline may also use negotiated rates that could involve rates above or below the recourse rate or rates that are subject to a different rate structure than the rates specified in EQM's interstate pipeline tariffs, provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement. A prerequisite for allowing the negotiated rates is that negotiated rate customers must have had the option to take service under the pipeline's recourse rates. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 96% of the system's contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. Some negotiated rate transactions are designed to fix the negotiated rate for the term of the firm transportation agreement and the fixed rate is generally not subject to adjustment for increased or decreased costs occurring during the contract term.
FERC regulations also extend to the terms and conditions set forth in agreements for transmission and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement is materially non-conforming, in whole or in part, it could reject, or require EQM to seek modification of, the agreement, or alternatively require EQM to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers or class of customers.
FERC Regulation of Gathering Rates and Terms of Service. While the FERC does not generally regulate the rates and terms of service over facilities determined to be performing a natural gas gathering function, it has traditionally regulated rates charged by interstate pipelines for gathering services performed on the pipeline's own gathering facilities when those gathering services are performed in connection with jurisdictional interstate transmission services. EQM maintains rates and terms of service in its tariff for unbundled gathering services performed on its gathering facilities in connection with the transmission service. Just as with rates and terms of service for transmission and storage services, EQM's rates and terms of services for its FERC-regulated low-pressure gathering system may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. 
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts certain natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. EQM believes that its high-pressure gathering systems meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a jurisdictional natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is often the subject of litigation in the industry, so the classification and regulation of these systems are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or the U.S. Congress.
Pipeline Safety and Maintenance. EQM's interstate natural gas pipeline system is subject to regulation by PHMSA. PHMSA has established safety requirements pertaining to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, including requirements that pipeline operators develop a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and implement pipeline integrity management programs. These integrity management plans require more frequent inspections and other preventive measures to ensure safe operation of oil and natural gas transportation pipelines in HCAs, such as high population areas or facilities that are hard to evacuate and areas of daily concentrations of people.
Notwithstanding the investigatory and preventative maintenance costs incurred in EQM's performance of customary pipeline management activities, EQM may incur significant additional expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or more stringent pipeline safety requirements are implemented. For example, in April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing several integrity management topics and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines. The proposed rule would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. This rule has not been finalized. Further, in June 2016, then-President Obama signed the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), extending PHMSA's statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. Although a reauthorization bill extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate until 2023 was introduced in 2019, Congress did not pass the bill in 2019 and PHMSA is operating under a continuing resolution until a new bill is passed. In addition, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act 
empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing and also required PHMSA to develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 2018. Pursuant to those provisions of the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA issued two separate Interim Final Rules in October 2016 and December 2016 that expanded the agency's authority to impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures and strengthened the rules related to underground natural gas storage facilities, including well integrity, wellbore tubing and casing integrity. The December 2016 Interim Final Rule, relating to underground gas storage facilities, went into effect in January 2017. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of provisions of the December 2016 Interim Final Rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule. Although PHMSA issued a press release in January 2020 stating that it has submitted a final rule for publication, as of this writing the final rule has not yet been published or made publicly available. On October 19, 2017, PHMSA formally reopened the comment period in response to a petition for reconsideration. This matter remains ongoing and subject to future PHMSA determinations. Additionally, in January 2017, PHMSA announced a new final rule regarding hazardous liquid pipelines, which increases the quality and frequency of tests that assess the condition of pipelines, requires operators to annually evaluate the existing protective measures in place for pipeline segments in HCAs, and expands the list of conditions that require immediate repair. However, it is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect because, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but were not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. Accordingly, this rule has not become effective through publication in the Federal Register. PHMSA published three final rules on pipeline safety: Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures; Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines; and Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments. The Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures rule, which became effective on December 2, 2019, implements an existing statutory authorization for PHMSA to issue emergency orders related to pipeline safety if an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes, or is causing an imminent hazard. The Safety of Hazardous Liquid Pipelines rule, which goes into effect on July 1, 2020, expands PHMSA's regulation of the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines by extending reporting requirements to certain hazardous liquid, gravity flow and rural gathering pipelines, establishing new requirements for integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines in HCAs and certain onshore hazardous liquid pipelines located outside of HCAs, extending leak detection requirements to all non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requiring new or replaced pipelines to be designed and built to accommodate in-line inspection devices, and requiring operators to inspect affected pipelines following an extreme weather event or natural disaster so they may address any resulting damage. The Safety of Gas Transmissions Pipelines rule, which goes into effect on July 1, 2020, requires operators of certain gas transmission pipelines that have been tested or that have inadequate records to determine the material strength of their lines by reconfirming the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, and establishes a new Moderate Consequence Area for determining regulatory requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments outside of HCAs. The rule also establishes new requirements for conducting baseline assessments, incorporates into the regulations industry standards and guidelines regarding design, construction and in-line inspections, and new requirements for data integration and risk analysis in integrity management programs, including seismicity, manufacturing and construction defects, and crack and crack-like defects, and includes several requirements that allow operators to notify PHMSA of proposed alternative approaches to achieving the objectives of the minimum safety standards. EQM is in the process of assessing the impact of these rules on its future costs of operations and revenue from operations.
States are generally preempted by federal law in the area of pipeline safety, but state agencies may qualify to assume responsibility for enforcing federal regulations over intrastate pipelines. They may also promulgate additive pipeline safety regulations provided that the state standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards. Although many of EQM's natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to integrity management requirements, EQM may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt transmission pipelines. The costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down EQM's pipelines during the pendency of such actions, could be material.
Should EQM fail to comply with DOT regulations adopted under authority granted to PHMSA, it could be subject to penalties and fines. PHMSA has the statutory authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $210,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2.1 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. In addition, EQM may be required to make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future for similar regulatory compliance initiatives that are not reflected in its forecasted maintenance capital expenditures.
EQM believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all existing federal, state and local pipeline safety laws and regulations. However, the adoption of new laws and regulations, such as those proposed by PHMSA, could result in significant 
added costs or delays in service or the termination of projects, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM in the future.
Environmental Matters 
General. EQM's operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can restrict or affect EQM's business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the acquisition of various permits to conduct regulated activities;


• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way EQM can handle or dispose of its wastes;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; and


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate or eliminate pollution conditions caused by EQM's operations or attributable to former operations.

In addition, EQM's operations and construction activities are subject to county and local ordinances that restrict the time, place or manner in which those activities may be conducted so as to reduce or mitigate nuisance-type conditions, such as, for example, excessive levels of dust or noise or increased traffic congestion.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Also, certain environmental statutes impose strict, and in some cases joint and several, liability for the cleanup and restoration of sites where hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released regardless of the fault of the current site owner or operator. Consequently, EQM may be subject to environmental liability at its currently owned or operated facilities for conditions caused by others prior to its involvement.
EQM has implemented programs and policies designed to keep its pipelines and other facilities in compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, and EQM does not believe that its compliance with such legal requirements will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders. Nonetheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be significantly in excess of the amounts EQM currently anticipates. For example, in October 2015, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion for the current 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 parts per billion for both standards. The EPA may designate the areas in which EQM operates as nonattainment areas. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment areas will be required to develop implementation plans demonstrating how the areas will attain the applicable standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that impose volatile organic compound and methane emissions limits (and collaterally reduce methane emissions) on certain types of compressors and pneumatic pumps, as well as requiring the development and implementation of leak monitoring plans for compressor stations. The EPA finalized amendments to some requirements in these standards in March 2018 and September 2018, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements such as fugitive emissions monitoring frequency. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of EQM's equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase EQM's capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely affect EQM's business. EQM tries to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. While EQM believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, there is no assurance that the current conditions will continue in the future.
The following is a discussion of several of the material environmental laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, that relate to EQM's business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and companies that transported, disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the 
hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these "responsible persons" may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. EQM generates materials in the course of its ordinary operations that are regulated as "hazardous substances" under CERCLA or similar state laws and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA, or such laws, for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
EQM also generates solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the ordinary course of EQM's operations, EQM generates wastes constituting solid waste and, in some instances, hazardous wastes. While certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations, it is possible that these wastes will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on EQM's maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
EQM owns, leases or operates properties where petroleum hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. EQM has generally utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, although petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated by EQM, or on or under the other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under EQM's control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, EQM could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including EQM's compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that EQM obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. EQM's failure to comply with these requirements could subject it to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. EQM may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining permits and approvals for air emissions. Compliance with these requirements may require modifications to certain of EQM's operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from EQM's compressors that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely affect EQM's business.
Climate Change. Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis. 
In 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. While the current U.S. administration announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, under the agreement's terms the earliest the U.S. can withdraw is 2020. There are no guarantees that the agreement will not be re-implemented in the U.S. or re-implemented in part by specific U.S. states or local governments. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase EQM's cost of environmental compliance by requiring EQM to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or purchase emission allowances. The effect of climate change legislation or regulation on EQM's business is currently uncertain. If EQM incurs additional costs to comply with such legislation or regulations, it may not be able to pass on the higher costs to its customers or recover all the costs related to complying with such requirements and any such recovery may depend on events beyond EQM's control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final 
legislation or implementing regulations. EQM's future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to its customers. Additionally, EQM's customers or suppliers may also be affected by legislation or regulation, which may adversely impact their drilling schedules and production volumes and reduce the volumes delivered to EQM and demand for its services. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements. For example, in October 2015, the EPA expanded the petroleum and natural gas system sources for which annual GHG emissions reporting would be required. Additionally, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of GHGs from new and existing sources. If implemented, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to, or taxes on the release, capture and use of GHGs that could have an adverse effect on EQM's operations. The effect of any new legislative or regulatory measures on EQM will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.
Water Discharges. The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants or dredged and fill material into state waters, as well as waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of permits issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (U.S. Army Corps) or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps rules defining the scope of the EPA's and the U.S. Army Corps' jurisdiction became effective (the 2015 Clean Water Rule). But the 2015 Clean Water Rule was promptly challenged in courts and was enjoined by judicial action in some states. Further, in October 2019 the EPA issued a rule repealing the 2015 Clean Water Rule and recodifying the preexisting regulations. The EPA has not yet finalized its anticipated rule narrowing the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act. To the extent that any future rules expand the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, EQM could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for activities in jurisdictional waters, including wetlands.
Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. EQM believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.
National Environmental Policy Act. The construction of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines pursuant to the NGA requires authorization from the FERC. The FERC actions are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies, such as the FERC, to evaluate major federal actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will either prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative effects of a proposed project or, if necessary, a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement. Any proposed plans for future construction activities that require FERC authorization will be subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to significantly delay or limit, and significantly increase the cost of, development of midstream infrastructure.
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of EQM's facilities are located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, EQM believes that it is in substantial compliance with the ESA. The designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, could cause EQM to incur additional costs, result in delays in construction of pipelines and facilities, or cause EQM to become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to receive hundreds of petitions to consider listing additional species as endangered or threatened and is being regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions may result in the listing of species located in areas in which EQM operates.
Employee Health and Safety. EQM is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community "right-to-know" regulations and comparable state laws and regulations require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in EQM's operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. EQM believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Seasonality
Weather affects natural gas demand for power generation and heating purposes. Peak demand for natural gas typically occurs during the winter months as a result of the heating load.
Insurance
In the Predecessor period, EQM generally shared insurance coverage with EQT. Subsequent to the Separation, EQM generally shares insurance coverage with Equitrans Midstream. EQM reimburses Equitrans Midstream for the cost of the insurance pursuant to the terms of the Equitrans Midstream Omnibus Agreement. The insurance program includes excess liability insurance, auto liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance and property insurance. In addition, EQM has procured separate general liability and directors and officers liability policies. All insurance coverage is in amounts management believes to be reasonable and appropriate.
Employees
EQM does not have any employees. EQM is managed by the directors and officers of the EQM General Partner. All executive management personnel of the EQM General Partner are officers of Equitrans Midstream and devote the time to EQM's business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct its operations. The daily business operations of EQM are conducted by employees of Equitrans Midstream and its subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Equitrans Midstream Omnibus Agreement, EQM reimburses Equitrans Midstream for the provision of general and administrative services for its benefit, for direct expenses incurred by Equitrans Midstream on EQM's behalf and for expenses allocated to EQM as a result of it being a public entity. Additionally, EQM has a secondment agreement with Equitrans Midstream whereby Equitrans Midstream and its subsidiaries provide seconded employees to perform certain operating and other services with respect to EQM's business. Prior to the Separation, the daily business operations of EQM were conducted by employees of EQT and its subsidiaries. EQM reimbursed EQT for the provision of general and administrative services for its benefit, for direct expenses incurred by EQT on EQM's behalf and for expenses allocated to EQM as a result of it being a public entity. See Note 8 for further discussion.
