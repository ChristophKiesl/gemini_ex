Item 1 – Business.
General
The Hillman Companies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Hillman” or “Company”) are one of the largest providers of hardware-related products and related merchandising services to retail markets in North America. Our principal business is operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hillman Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Hillman Group”), which had net sales of approximately $1,214.4 million in 2019. Hillman Group sells its products to hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, pet supply stores, and other retail outlets principally in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Product lines include thousands of small parts such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; personal protective equipment, such as gloves and eye-wear; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs. We support product sales with services that include design and installation of merchandising systems and maintenance of appropriate in-store inventory levels.
Our headquarters are located at 10590 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio. We maintain a website at www.hillmangroup.com. Information contained or linked on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report and should not be considered a part of this annual report.
On August 16, 2019, we acquired the assets of Sharp Systems, LLC ("Resharp"), a California-based innovative developer of automated knife sharpening systems, for a cash payment of $3.0 million and contingent consideration valued at $18.1 million. The maximum payout for the contingent consideration is $25.0 million plus 1.8% of net knife-sharpening revenues for five years after the $25.0 million is fully paid. Resharp has business operations in the United States and its financial results reside within our Consumer Connected Solutions segment. 
On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired the assets of West Coast Washers, Inc for a total purchase price of $3.1 million. The financial results of West Coast Washers, Inc. reside within the Company's Fastening, Hardware, and Personal Protective Solutions segment. 
On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of NB Parent Company, Inc. and its affiliated companies including Big Time Products, LLC and Rooster Products International, Inc. (collectively, "Big Time"), a leading provider of Personal Protective Solutions and work gear products for a purchase price of approximately $348.8 million. With the addition of Big Time, Hillman’s product portfolio now spans the hardware, automotive, garden, and cleaning categories and includes Big Time’s industry-leading brands such as Firm Grip, AWP, McGuire-Nicholas, Grease Monkey, and Gorilla Grip, which are sold throughout retailers in North America. Big Time has operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico and is included in our Fastening, Hardware, and Personal Protective Solutions segment.
On August 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Minute Key Holdings, Inc. (“MinuteKey”), an innovative leader in self-service key duplicating kiosks, for a total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of $156.3 million. We believe that the combination of MinuteKey's self service kiosk business with Hillman's existing key duplication platform will create additional growth opportunities. MinuteKey has operations in the United States and Canada and is included in our Consumer Connected Solutions segment.
On November 8, 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Hargis Industries, LP doing business as ST Fastening Systems ("STFS") and other related parties pursuant to which Hillman acquired substantially all of the assets, and assumed certain liabilities, of STFS. STFS, which is located in Tyler, Texas, specializes in manufacturing and distributing threaded self-drilling fasteners, foam closure strips, and other accessories to the steel-frame, post-frame, and residential building markets. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we paid a cash purchase price of approximately $47.3 million. The STFS business is included in our Fastening, Hardware, and Personal Protective Solutions segment.
Hillman Group
We are comprised of three separate operating business segments: (1) Fastening, Hardware, and Personal Protective Solutions, (2) Consumer Connected Solutions, and (3) Canada.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company implemented a plan to restructure the management and operations of our U.S. business to achieve synergies and cost savings associated with the recent acquisitions. The restructuring plan includes management realignment, integration of sales and operations functions, and strategic review of our product offerings. We incurred charges of $9.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2019, primarily related to inventory valuation adjustments and severance (see Note 14 - Restructuring of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details).
In connection with the restructuring, and to better support the review of our results, we have revised the classification of certain product categories and associated costs within our operating segment reporting structure. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we moved from a geographic segment structure to a hybrid product based and geographic structure. This change aligns the reportable segments with the information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Concurrent with this change, the Company has revised prior period segment information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on previously reported consolidated revenues, total operating expenditures, operating income or net income as a result of these changes.
We provide products such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; personal protective equipment, such as gloves and eye-wear; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs, to retail outlets, primarily hardware stores, home centers and mass merchants, pet supply stores, grocery stores, and drug stores. We complement our extensive product selection with regular retailer visits by our field sales and service organization.
We market and distribute a wide variety of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) of small, hard-to-find and hard-to-manage hardware items. We function as a category manager for retailers and support these products with in-store service, high order fill rates, and rapid delivery of products sold. Sales and service representatives regularly visit retail outlets to review stock levels, reorder items in need of replacement, and interact with the store management to offer new product and merchandising ideas. Thousands of items can be actively managed with the retailer experiencing a substantial reduction of in-store labor costs and replenishment paperwork. Service representatives also assist in organizing the products in a consumer-friendly manner. We complement our broad range of products with merchandising services such as displays, product identification stickers, retail price labels, store rack and drawer systems, assistance in rack positioning and store layout, and inventory restocking services. We regularly refresh retailers' displays with new products and package designs utilizing color-coding to simplify the shopping experience for consumers and improve the attractiveness of individual store displays.
We operate from 25 strategically located distribution centers in North America. Our main distribution centers utilize state-of-the-art warehouse management systems (“WMS”) to ship customer orders within 48 hours while achieving a very high order fill rate. We also supplement our operations with third-party logistics providers to warehouse and ship customer orders in the certain areas.
Products and Suppliers
Our product strategy concentrates on providing total project solutions using the latest technology for common and unique home improvement projects. Our portfolio provides retailers the assurance that their shoppers can find the right product at the right price within an 'easy to shop' environment.
We currently manage a worldwide supply chain comprised of a large number of vendors, the largest of which accounted for approximately 2.8% of the Company's annual purchases and the top five of which accounted for approximately 11.6% of its annual purchases. Our vendor quality control procedures include on-site evaluations and frequent product testing. Vendors are also evaluated based on delivery performance and the accuracy of their shipments.
Fastening, Hardware, and Personal Protective Solutions
Fastening and Hardware Solutions
Fastening and hardware remains the core of our business. The product line encompasses one of the largest selections among suppliers servicing the retail hardware industry. Fastening solutions consist of three categories: core fasteners, construction fasteners, and anchors. Core fasteners include nuts, bolts, screws, washers, and specialty items. Construction fasteners include deck, drywall, metal screws, and both hand driven and collated nails. Anchors include hollow wall and solid wall items such as plastic anchors, toggle bolts, concrete screws, and wedge anchors. Hardware consists of builders’ hardware, threaded rod and metal shapes, picture hanging, home décor, and letters, numbers, and signs (“LNS”).
There are several brands within the Fastening product category. The core fastener line is marketed under the Hillman name for its brand. Construction fasteners have several brands including: PowerPro™, Deckplus™, and Fas-n-Tite™. Our premium line of PowerPro™ products are specifically engineered for ultimate performance with the most advanced materials, coatings, and designs and have earned the reputation and trust of both professionals and homeowners through its availability in retailers nationwide. 
The builder's hardware category includes a variety of common household items such as coat hooks, door stops, hinges, gate latches, and decorative hardware. We market the builder's hardware products under the Hardware Essentials™ brand and provide the retailer with innovation in both product and merchandising solutions. The Hardware Essentials™ program utilizes modular packaging, color coding, and integrated merchandising to simplify the shopping experience for consumers. Colorful signs, packaging, and installation instructions guide the consumer quickly and easily to the correct product location in store while digital content including pictures and videos assist the on-line journey. Hardware Essentials™ provides retailers and consumers decorative upgrade opportunities through contemporary finishes and designs.
The wall hanging category includes traditional picture hanging hardware and the High & Mighty™ series of tool-free wall hangers, decorative hooks and floating shelves that was launched in 2017.
We are the leading supplier of metal shapes and threaded rod in the retail market. The SteelWorks™ threaded rod product includes hot and cold rolled rod, both weldable and plated, as well as a complete offering of All-Thread rod in galvanized steel, stainless steel, and brass. The SteelWorks™ program is carried by many top retailers, including Lowe's and Menard's, and through cooperatives such as Ace Hardware. In addition, we are the primary supplier of metal shapes to many wholesalers throughout the country.
Letters, numbers, and signs (“LNS”) includes product lines that target both the homeowner and commercial user. Product lines within this category include individual and/or packaged letters, numbers, signs, safety related products (e.g. 911 signs), driveway markers, and a diversity of sign accessories, such as sign frames.
On November 8, 2017, we acquired STFS. STFS, which is located in Tyler, Texas, specializes in manufacturing and distributing threaded self-drilling fasteners, foam closure strips, and other accessories to the steel-frame, post-frame, and residential building markets. STFS added $51.4 million, $47.2 million and $5.9 million in revenue for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.
Fastening and hardware solutions generated approximately $607.2 million of revenues in 2019, as compared to $581.3 million in 2018 and $529.0 million in 2017.
Personal Protective Solutions
In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of NB Parent Company, Inc. and its affiliated companies including Big Time Products, LLC and Rooster Products International, Inc. (collectively, "Big Time"), a leading provider of personal protective and work gear products. With the addition of Big Time, our product portfolio now spans the hardware, automotive, garden, and cleaning categories and includes Big Time’s industry-leading brands such as Firm Grip, AWP, McGuire-Nicholas, Grease Monkey, and Gorilla Grip, which are sold throughout retailers in North America. Big Time’s high-quality products like gloves, wearable tool storage, jobsite storage and kneepads, as well as outstanding customer service and award-winning packaging have had a dramatic impact on the industry. 
Personal protective solutions generated approximately $245.8 million and $55.4 million of revenues in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. There were no sales of personal protective solutions prior to the Big Time acquisition. 
Consumer Connected Solutions 
Our Consumer Connected Solutions segment consists primarily of key duplication and engraving solutions that are tailored to the unique need of the consumer. We provide these offerings in retail and other high-traffic locations offering customized licensed and unlicensed products targeted to consumers in the respective locations. It also includes our associate-assisted key duplication systems and key accessories. Our programs include product and category management, merchandising services, and access to our proprietary key duplicating equipment.
Keys and Key Accessories
We design and manufacture proprietary equipment which forms the cornerstone for our key duplication business. Our key duplication system is offered in various retail channels including mass merchants, home centers, automotive parts retailers, franchise and independent (“F&I”) hardware stores, and grocery/drug chains. We design, manufacture, and assemble the key duplication kiosks in our Tempe, Arizona facility.
This proprietary equipment for key duplication varies by retail channel to fit that channel’s specific needs. The Hillman key program targets the F&I hardware retailers with a traditional machine that works well in businesses with lower turnover and highly skilled employees. The Axxess Precision Key Duplication System™ continues to be the most prevalent system with approximately 8,000 programs placed and marketed to national retailers requiring a high volume key duplication program easily mastered by novice associates. Our Precision Laser Key System™ system uses a digital optical camera, lasers, and proprietary software to scan a customer's key. The system identifies the key and retrieves the key's specifications, including the appropriate blank and cutting pattern, from a comprehensive database. This technology automates nearly every aspect of key duplication and provides the ability for every store associate to cut a key accurately. Approximately 2,700 of these key duplicating systems are in service throughout North American retailers. The Hillman KeyKrafter™ is our most innovative and effective key duplication equipment. It provides significant reduction in duplication time while increasing accuracy and ease of use. Additionally, with the KeyKrafter™ solution, the capability exists for consumers to securely store and retrieve digital back-ups of their key without the original though the revolutionary Hillman KeyHero™ smart phone application. There are over 5,400 KeyKrafter™ programs placed in North American retailers. Finally, in the automotive key space, we offer the SmartBox Automotive Key Programmer which is a tool to quickly and easily pair transponder keys, remotes, and smart keys. There are over 2,800 SmartBox programs placed in retailers throughout North America. 
In 2018, we completed the acquisition of MinuteKey, the world's first self-service key duplication machine. The accuracy of robotics technology put to work in an innovative way makes MinuteKey machines easy to use, convenient and fast. The kiosk is completely self-service and has a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. We have over 6,000 MinuteKey machines located in high-traffic locations of some of the largest retailers throughout North America. 
We also market keys and key accessories in conjunction with our duplication systems. Our proprietary key offering features the universal blank which uses a "universal" keyway to replace up to five original equipment keys. This innovative system allows a retailer to duplicate 99% of the key market while stocking less than 100 SKUs. We continually refresh the retailer's key offering by introducing decorated and licensed keys and accessories. Our Wackey™ and Fanatix™ lines feature decorative themes of art and popular licenses such as NFL, Disney, Breast Cancer Awareness, and M&M's to increase personalization, purchase frequency and average transaction value per key. We also market a successful line of decorative and licensed lanyards.
Keys and key accessories generated approximately $185.5 million of revenues in 2019, as compared to $143.9 million in 2018 and $115.9 million in 2017.
Engraving
In addition, we supply a variety of innovative options of consumer-operated vending systems such as Quick-Tag™, TagWorks™, and FIDO™ for engraving specialty items such as pet identification tags, luggage tags, and other engraved identification tags. We have developed unique engraving systems leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to provide a customized solution for mass merchant, pet supply retailers, and other high traffic areas such as theme parks. As of December 29, 2018, over 7,500 of our engraving systems are in service in retail locations which are also supported by our sales and service representatives.
Our engraving business focuses on the growing consumer spending trends surrounding personalized and pet identification. Innovation has played a major role in the development of our engraving business unit. From the original Quick-Tag™ consumer-operated vending system to the proprietary laser system of TagWorks™, we continue to lead the industry with consumer-friendly engraving solutions.
We design, manufacture, and assemble the engraving kiosks in our Tempe, Arizona facility. Engraving generated approximately $50.6 million of revenues in 2019, as compared to $52.1 million in 2018 and $55.7 million in 2017.
Canada
Our Canada segment distributes fasteners and related hardware items, threaded rod, keys, key duplicating systems, accessories, and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs to hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, industrial distributors, automotive aftermarket distributors, and other retail outlets and industrial Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) in Canada. The product lines offered in our Canada segment are consistent with the product offerings detailed above. The Canada segment also produces made to order screws and self-locking fasteners for automotive suppliers, OEMs, and industrial distributors.
Our Canada segment generated approximately $125.3 million of revenues in 2019, as compared to $141.4 million in 2018 and $137.8 million in 2017.
Markets and Customers
We sell our products to national accounts such as Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart, Tractor Supply, Menard's, PetSmart, and PETCO. Our status as a national supplier of proprietary products to big box retailers allows us to develop a strong market position and high barriers to entry within our product categories.
We service a wide variety of F&I retail outlets. These individual dealers are typically members of the larger cooperatives, such as Ace Hardware, True Value, and Do-It-Best. We ship directly to the cooperative's retail locations and also supply many items to the cooperative's central warehouses. These central warehouses distribute to their members that do not have a requirement for Hillman's in-store service. These arrangements reduce credit risk and logistic expenses for us while also reducing central warehouse inventory and delivery costs for the cooperatives.
A typical hardware store maintains thousands of different items in inventory, many of which generate small dollar sales but large profits. It is difficult for a retailer to economically monitor all stock levels and to reorder the products from multiple vendors. This problem is compounded by the necessity of receiving small shipments of inventory at different times and stocking the goods. The failure to have these small items available will have an adverse effect on store traffic, thereby possibly denying the retailer the opportunity to sell items that generate higher dollar sales.
We sell our products to a large volume of customers, the top three of which accounted for approximately $637.0 million, or approximately 52%, of our total revenue in 2019. For the year ended December 28, 2019, Home Depot was the single largest customer, representing approximately $291.9 million of our total revenues, Lowe's was the second largest at approximately $251.3 million, and Walmart was the third largest at approximately $93.9 million of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 5.0% of total revenue in 2019. In each of the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, we derived over 10% of our total revenues from Lowe's and Home Depot which operated in each of our operating segments.
In 2019, Hillman continued to expanded its B2B eCommerce platform allowing certain customers to order online through the Company’s website, www.hillmangroup.com. The B2B eCommerce platform features over 50,000 items available for sale online and over 2,500 customers are enrolled with the online ordering platform. We continue to support direct-to-store and direct-to-consumer fulfillment for consumers who choose to order fasteners directly from retailers' websites, supporting over 30,000 items that are available for sale. 
Sales and Marketing
We provide product support and customer service for our retail distribution partners. We believe that our competitive advantage is in our ability to provide a greater level of customer service than our competitors.
Service is the hallmark of Hillman company-wide. The national accounts field service organization consists of approximately 650 employees and 50 field managers focusing on big box retailers, pet super stores, large national discount chains, and grocery stores. This organization reorders products, details store shelves, and sets up in-store promotions. Many of our largest customers use electronic data interchange (“EDI”) for processing of orders and invoices.
We employ what we believe to be the largest direct sales force in the industry. The sales force, which consists of approximately 250 employees and is managed by 30 field managers, focuses on the F&I customers. The depth of the sales and service team enables us to maintain consistent call cycles ensuring that all customers experience proper stock levels and inventory turns. This team also prepares custom plan-o-grams of displays to fit the needs of any store and establishes programs that meet customers' requirements for pricing, invoicing, and other needs. This group also benefits from daily internal support from our inside sales and customer service teams. On average, each sales representative is responsible for approximately 60 full service accounts that the sales representative calls on approximately every two weeks.
These efforts, coupled with those of the marketing department, allow the sales force to sell and support our product lines. Our marketing department provides support through the development of new products and categories, sales collateral material, promotional items, merchandising aids, and custom signage. Marketing services such as advertising, graphic design, and trade show management are also provided to the sales force. The department is organized along our three marketing competencies: product management, channel marketing, and marketing communications.
Competition
Our primary competitors in the national accounts marketplace for fasteners are Illinois Tool Works Inc., Dorman Products Inc., Midwest Fastener Corporation, Primesource Building Products, Inc., and competition from direct import by our customers. Our national competitors for gloves and personal protective equipment include West Chester Protective Gear, PIP, Iron Clad and MidWest Quality Gloves, Inc. Competition is based primarily on in-store service and price. Other competitors are local and regional distributors. Competitors in the pet tag market are specialty retailers, direct mail order, and retailers with in-store mail order capability. The Quick-Tag™, FIDO™, and TagWorks™ systems have patent protected technology that is a major barrier to entry and helps to preserve this market segment. 
The principal competitors for our F&I business are Midwest Fastener and Hy-Ko Products Company (“Hy-Ko”) in the hardware store marketplace. Midwest Fastener primarily focuses on fasteners, while Hy-Ko is the major competitor in LNS products and keys/key accessories. The hardware outlets that purchase our products without regularly scheduled sales representative visits may also purchase products from local and regional distributors and cooperatives. We compete primarily on field service, merchandising, as well as product availability, price, and depth of product line.
Insurance Arrangements
Under our current insurance programs, commercial umbrella coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposure and aggregate losses in excess of expected claims. We retain the exposure on certain expected losses related to workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile claims. We also retain the exposure on expected losses related to health benefits of certain employees. We believe that our present insurance is adequate for our businesses. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
As of December 28, 2019, we had 3,764 full time and part time employees, none of which were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In our opinion, employee relations are good.
Backlog
We do not consider the sales backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance due to the short order cycle of our business. Our sales backlog from ongoing operations was approximately $19.2 million as of December 28, 2019 and approximately $14.9 million as of December 29, 2018. We expect to realize the entire December 28, 2019 backlog during fiscal 2020.
