ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
We provide differentiated development and manufacturing solutions for drugs, protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, and consumer health products at over fifty facilities across four continents under rigorous quality and operational standards. Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies, along with our state-of-the-art protein and cell and gene therapy manufacturing capacity, address a wide and growing range of modalities and therapeutic and other categories across the biopharmaceutical and consumer health industries. Through our extensive capabilities, growth-enabling capacity, and deep expertise in product development, regulatory compliance, and clinical trial supply, we can help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in the last decade. Our development and manufacturing platforms, which include those in our Biologics, Softgel and Oral Technologies, and Oral and Specialty Delivery segments, our proven formulation, supply, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep development and manufacturing know-how enable our customers to advance and then bring to market more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Our commitment to reliably supply our customers’ and their patients’ needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce more than 70 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 24 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in state-of-the-art facilities and capacity expansion, including investments in facilities focused on new treatment modalities and other attractive market segments, our continuous improvement activities devoted to operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing and introduction of new customer products, and, in some cases, our innovation activities and patents, we will continue to attract premium opportunities and realize the growth potential from these areas. 
We continue to invest in both our product and service offerings and our sales and marketing activities, leading to growth in the number of active development programs for our customers. This has further enhanced our extensive, long-duration relationships and long-term contracts with a broad and diverse range of industry-leading customers. In fiscal 2021, we conducted business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 17 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally. Selected key customers include AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Pierre Fabre. We have many long-standing relationships with our customers, particularly those with commercial products, as we provide support and reliable supply through each stage of the products’ lifecycles. A prescription pharmaceutical product relationship with an innovator will often last many years—in several cases, two decades or more—extending from pre-clinical development through more mature stages of the product’s life cycle. We serve customers requiring some combination of innovative product development, superior quality, state-of-the-art manufacturing, and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs. Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with all aspects of our customers’ final formulations and dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of our facilities as manufacturing and testing sites in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings. Both factors frequently translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level. 
We believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies, continuous innovations and improvements, consistent and reliable supply, geographic reach, and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of business and product solutions that can be customized to fit their individual needs. Today we employ more than 8,000 highly trained direct manufacturing associates, as well as more than 2,500 formulation, analytical development, and process scientists and technicians. We can also bring to bear when helpful to our customers more than 1,300 patents and patent applications in advanced delivery platforms, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. The aim of our offerings is to allow our customers to bring more products to market faster and to develop and market differentiated products that improve patient outcomes. We believe our leading market position and diversity of customers, offerings, regulatory categories, products, and geographies reduce our exposure to potential strategic and product shifts within our industries. 
We provide a wide variety of proprietary and non-proprietary, differentiated technologies, products, and service offerings to our customers across our development and manufacturing platforms, which we have advanced and grown over more than 90 years through internal development, strategic alliances, in-licensing, and acquisitions. We initially introduced our softgel capsule technologies in the 1930s and have continuously expanded our range of offerings. In recent years, we have launched more than a dozen internally developed new technology platform offerings. We have also augmented our portfolio through acquisitions. Among the technologies we currently offer are softgel capsules, including both gelatin and non-gelatin formulations, our Zydis orally disintegrating tablets, protein production using advanced mammalian cell lines, adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vectors, and a range of other oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies. The technologies and service offerings within our development solution platforms span the full drug development process, ranging from our OptiForm 
Solution Suite for enhancement of bioavailability and other characteristics of early-stage small molecules, Gene Product Expression (“GPEx”), GPEx Boost, and GPEx Lightning for protein manufacture, and SMARTag platforms for development of biologics and antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), to formulation, analytical services, early-stage clinical development, drug-device combination development and supply, fill and finish operations for injectable products, and clinical trials supply, including our unique FlexDirect direct-to-patient and FastChain demand-led clinical supply solutions. In fiscal 2021, we expanded our recently acquired cell therapy development and manufacturing capabilities, began offering plasmid DNA production services, and signed an agreement to acquire a developer and manufacturer of induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPSCs”). We also expanded our spray-dry, liquid nasal, and dry powder inhaler offerings. Our offerings serve a critical need in the development and manufacture of products across a broad range of product types. We focus on serving as an accelerator for new formulation, delivery, and manufacturing technologies, and our expertise enables us to bring advanced products to market at scale, faster.
In large part due to our recent acquisitions and their subsequent organic growth, the revenue contribution from our Biologics segment has grown from approximately 17% in fiscal 2016 to 48% in fiscal 2021. We believe our own internal innovation, supplemented by current and future external partnerships and acquisitions, will continue to strengthen and extend our leadership positions in the development, reliable supply, and delivery of drugs, protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, and consumer health products.
History
We trace our history to the 1933 founding of the R.P. Scherer Corporation, which developed the first rotary die machine for the manufacture of soft gelatin capsules, and assumed our current form in April 2007. We regularly review our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan, and, as a result, we have sold nine businesses and consolidated operations at six facilities since fiscal 2007, integrating them into the remaining facility network. In fiscal 2021, we sold our facility in Woodstock, Illinois and initiated a plan to close our facility in Bolton, U.K. We have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities. In fiscal 2021 alone, we closed six acquisitions and signed an agreement to acquire RheinCell Therapeutics GmbH, a developer and manufacturer of iPSCs. In July 2014, we completed the initial public offering of our Common Stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “CTLT.” 
We are a holding company that indirectly owns Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (“Operating Company”), which owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating assets.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Available, State-of-the-art Manufacturing Capacity in Attractive Market Segments
We have invested several billion dollars over the last few years, and plan to continue to invest, to broaden our portfolio of offerings and expand our capacity with state-of-the-art development and manufacturing capabilities that focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of the evolving biopharmaceutical and consumer health industries. In addition, we have hired and trained thousands of new direct manufacturing associates in our rigorous, quality-focused culture of operational excellence. The capacity and capabilities we have built and purchased have enabled, and our further planned expansions will continue to enable, us to secure, along with our operational and quality excellence, attractive new business opportunities in the expanding market for outsourced product development and supply. 
Vibrant, Patient First-Driven Culture
From the manufacturing line to the executive suite, for all our critical decisions, we ask the question, “What would the impact be to the patient?”, and our culture is built on our cornerstone value of Patient First. We believe this mindset, which aligns closely with our customers’ values, enables a pervasive focus on patient safety, impact, and outcomes, and an uncompromising approach to product quality and compliance, by reminding us of those who depend upon our vigilance concerning the safety, quality, reliability, and sustainability of our product supply. Along with other key cultural strengths, including our commitments to diversity and inclusion and to science-based environmental sustainability, we believe our culture brings us both a unique reputation and an operating capability that is difficult to replicate.
Diversified Operating Platform 
We are diversified by virtue of our broad range of product and service offerings, our geographic scope, our large customer portfolio, the extensive range of products we produce, and our ability to provide solutions at every stage of a product’s lifecycle. In fiscal 2021, we produced nearly 7,000 distinct products across multiple categories. Our fiscal 2021 net 
revenue was distributed as follows: protein-based biologics and cell and gene therapies 52%, branded drugs 33%, generic prescription drugs 4%, over-the-counter drugs 6%, and consumer health, veterinary products, medical devices, and diagnostics 5% combined). In fiscal 2021, our top 20 products represented approximately 38% of our total net revenue, with no single customer accounting for greater than 10% of net revenue and with no individual product greater than 8%. We serve more than 1,000 customers in approximately 80 countries, with 38% of our fiscal 2021 net revenue coming from outside the U.S. This diversity, combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships, has contributed to the stability of our business. It has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with potential strategic, customer, and product shifts as well as to payer-driven pricing pressures experienced by our drug and biologic customers.
Longstanding, Extensive Relationships with a Diverse Customer Portfolio
We have longstanding, extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. In fiscal 2021, we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 17 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally, as well as with more than 1,000 other customers, including emerging and specialty biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models. Regardless of size, our customers seek innovative product development, superior quality, advanced manufacturing, and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs.
We believe our customers value us because our broad range of product and service offerings, expanding capacity in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including facilities offering new treatment modalities, reliable supply, geographic reach, commitment to operational and quality excellence, and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions, many of which are unavailable from other individual providers.
Deep, Broad, and Growing Advanced Technology Foundation
 Our breadth of offerings employing advanced technologies and state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants. Our leading softgel platforms, including Liqui-Gels, OptiShell, and Vegicaps capsules, and our modified release technologies, including the Zydis family of orally disintegrating tablets, our spray drying capabilities, and our OptiPact and OptiMelt technologies, provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers. We offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via oral, respiratory, and injectable routes and also provide advanced biologics formulation options, including GPEx, GPEx Boost, and GPEx Lightning mammalian cell lines for protein production, SMARTag ADC technology, AAV vectors for cell and gene therapies, and plasmid DNA manufacturing. We have a leadership position within respiratory delivery, including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and intra-nasal forms. We have reinforced our leadership position in advanced technologies over the last three years, as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications, including the launch of spray-dry dispersion, and recently purchased or expanded our businesses developing and manufacturing protein-based biologic medicines, fill and finish for injectable drugs and biologics, cell and gene therapy offerings, and other new therapeutic and other modalities. Our culture of creativity, problem-solving, and innovation is grounded in our advanced technologies, the substantial expertise and experience of our scientists and engineers, and, in some cases, our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes. Our global product development and innovation teams drive a focused application of resources to opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development. As of June 30, 2021, we had nearly 1,400 product development programs in active development across our businesses. 
Long-Duration Relationships Provide Sustainability 
Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield safe and effective final formulations and dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of Catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings. Both factors translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level, to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce long-duration commercial supply agreements. These agreements typically have initial terms of three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years (see “—Contractual Arrangements” for more detail). Approximately three-quarters of our fiscal 2021 net revenue from our product development and delivery offerings and related services (offered through our Biologics, Softgel and Oral Technologies, and Oral and Specialty Delivery reporting segments) were covered by such long-term contractual arrangements. We believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage. 
Significant Recent Growth Investments 
We have made over time, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in our manufacturing network, which is capable of serving customers and patients worldwide, and today employ approximately 7 million square feet of manufacturing, 
laboratory, and related space across four continents. We have deployed approximately $1.7 billion in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures, not including more than $3.0 billion spent in acquiring new facilities and businesses. Growth-related investments in facilities, capacity, and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand, including in gene and cell therapies and other new treatment modalities and fill and finish for injectable biologics. Through our focus on operational, quality, and regulatory excellence, we drive continuous improvements in safety, productivity, sustainability and reliable supply, which we believe further differentiate us. Our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality, delivery, sustainability, and regulatory compliance expectations. 
High Standards of Regulatory Compliance and Operational and Quality Excellence 
We operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) or other applicable requirements, following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We have approximately 1,600 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance. All of our facilities are registered where required with the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”). In many cases, our facilities are registered with multiple food, drug, or biologics regulatory agencies around the world. In fiscal 2021, we were subject to 52 regulatory audits, and, over the last five fiscal years, we successfully completed approximately 300 regulatory audits. We also undergo more than 500 customer and internal audits annually. We believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator.
Strong and Experienced Management Team 
Our executive leadership team collectively has approximately 600 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. With an average of approximately 28 years of functional experience, this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships.
Our Strategy
 Our strategic ambition, guided by and operationalized through our values, is to power the innovation and growth of the life science industry by becoming its leading development and commercial partner in reliable supply, advanced technologies, first-to-scale innovation, integrated solutions, and new therapeutic modalities. To achieve this, we continue to pursue the following key growth initiatives:
“Follow the Molecule”® by Providing Solutions to our Customers across all Phases of the Product Lifecycle 
We intend to continue to use our development and manufacturing solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth. Our development solutions span the drug development process, starting with our platforms for early pre-clinical development of small molecules, protein-based biologics, and cell and gene therapies; through formulation and analytical services, development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies, and fill and finish of injectable products; to regulatory consulting. Once a molecule is ready for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization, we provide our customers with a range of advanced technologies and expert, state-of-the-art manufacturing solutions that allow them to deliver their molecules to the end-users in safe, effective, and, in some cases, attractive dosage forms, and to produce biologics drug substances needed for protein-based biologics and cell and gene therapies. Our relationship with a molecule typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product and can extend throughout the molecule’s commercial life. For prescription products, we are typically the sole or primary outsourced provider and are frequently reflected in customers’ product approval applications. Our revenues from our development and manufacturing activities are primarily driven by volumes, and, as a result, the loss of an innovator drug’s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply customers offering generic or biosimilar equivalents. 
An example of the long and mutually productive relationships we foster can be found in a leading over-the-counter anti-allergy brand, which today uses both our Zydis orally disintegrating tablets and our Liqui-Gels softgel technology. We originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient sub-segment needs. After four years of development, we then commercially supplied the prescription product in our Zydis orally disintegrating tablet format for six years, and we have continued to provide the Zydis form since the switch to over-the-counter status in the U.S. and other markets in the early 2000s. Subsequently, we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer, which the customer elected to develop and launch as well. By following this molecule, we have built a strong, 29-year-long relationship across multiple formats and markets. 
Customer Product Pipeline — Continuing to Grow Through New Projects and Product Launches 
We intend to continue to supplement our existing diverse base of commercialized customer products with new development programs. As of June 30, 2021, our product development teams were working on nearly 1,400 active customer development programs. Our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand, as well as from our expanded capabilities and technology platforms. Although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical, protein-based biologic, cell and gene therapy, and consumer health products, we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our long-duration commercial revenues under long-term contracts and grow our existing product base. In fiscal 2021, we introduced 139 new products for our customers. 
Catalent continues to be a leader in providing chemistry, manufacturing, and controls-based product development services to the global pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health industries, driven by thousands of projects annually. In fiscal 2021, we recognized $1.76 billion of net revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers in our Biologics, Softgel and Oral Technologies, and Oral and Specialty Delivery reporting segments, up 73% from the prior year. In addition, substantially all of the revenue associated with the Clinical Supply Services segment relates to our support of customer products in development.
Capabilities & Capacity — Expanding in Biologics and Other Attractive Markets 
Recognizing the strategic importance of protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, plasmid DNA, and other newer biopharmaceutical modalities, we began to build a differentiated biologics platform in 2002. Since 2016, we have invested over $3.7 billion in our biologics business, including capital investments and approximately $2.6 billion for acquisitions of biologics-focused businesses and sites. Today, we are a recognized leader in biologics, including AAV vectors for gene therapies; development and supply for cell therapies; advanced cell-line development; formulation and fill-finish into vials, pre-filled syringes, and cartridges; specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substances; and bioanalytical analysis. We have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 700 cell lines, many using our advanced GPEx and GPEx Boost technologies, and have actively collaborated on developing and scaling up more than 100 cell and gene therapies. We have also invested in a second-generation ADC technology, SMARTag, and we see continued progress in our customers’ SMARTag product-development activities.
In addition to our expansion in biologics, we have invested additional capital in several other existing facilities in order to expand in attractive markets, including a significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in Winchester, Kentucky, and the scaling-up of commercial manufacturing capacity for metered-dose inhalers and our next-generation orally disintegrating tablet (“ODT”) technology, Zydis Ultra. We have also added specialized new capabilities and capacity in early development over the last several fiscal years. We expanded our capacity for oral and injectable products via our fiscal 2020 acquisition of a facility in Anagni, Italy, and for North American consumer health softgels via our fiscal 2017 acquisition of two facilities in Ontario, Canada.
Use Our Proprietary Technologies and Substantial Expertise to Help Our Customers Develop New Products
We have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by deep scientific expertise, extensive know-how, and more than 1,300 patents and patent applications in approximately 158 families across advanced delivery, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. For example, we have significant softgel fill and formulation know-how, databases of formulated products, and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise, and, as a result, approximately 90% of approvals by the FDA over the last 25 years of new chemical entities presented in a softgel format have been developed and supplied by us. 
In addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers’ products, for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proof-of-concept products, whether improved versions of existing drugs, new generic formulations, or innovative consumer health products. In the consumer health area, we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for self-created products, which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business. We expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other non-traditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms. These activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of end-market value through out-licensing, profit-sharing, and other arrangements. 
Operational Leverage — Deploy Existing Infrastructure and Operational Discipline to Drive Profitable Growth 
Through our existing infrastructure, including our global network of operating locations and programs, we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion. With our active focus on continuous improvement and sustainability enhancement, global procurement function, and conversion cost productivity metrics in place, we have created a culture of 
functional excellence and cost accountability. Along with the ongoing increase in the share of revenues from higher margin biologics offerings, we expect this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth. Since fiscal 2016, we have expanded gross margin by 200 basis points and Adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points. Note that “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), and that further explanations of this measure and comparisons to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are set forth below at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Metrics.”
Strategic Acquisitions and Licensing — Build on our Existing Platform
We operate in the markets for outsourced development solutions and commercial supply, where we estimate current spending at roughly $60.0 billion globally. Our broad platform, global infrastructure, and diversified customer portfolio provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets, to enter new markets, and generate operating leverage through acquisitions. Since fiscal 2013, we have executed 18 transactions, investing more than $3.2 billion, and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions. 
While we are rigorously focused on driving our organic growth, we have in recent years substantially increased our participation in biologics, including protein-based biologics, cell and gene therapies, plasmid DNA production, and drug product fill and finish, via strategy-driven inorganic transactions. We intend to continue opportunistically to source and execute strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas, as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within emerging treatment modalities, new geographic markets, or related market segments. We have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating, executing, and integrating such acquisitions. 
Our Reporting Segments 
We currently operate in four operating segments, which also constitute our four reporting segments: Biologics, Softgel and Oral Technologies, Oral and Specialty Delivery, and Clinical Supply Services, as further described below. 
Biologics
Our Biologics segment provides biologic cell-line, cell therapy and viral-based gene therapy development and manufacturing; formulation, development, and manufacturing for parenteral dose forms, including vials, prefilled syringes, and cartridges; and analytical development and testing services for large molecules. The business has extensive expertise in development, scale up, and commercial manufacturing. Representative customers of Biologics include Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, BMS, AstraZeneca, and Sarepta, along with a broad range of innovative small and mid-tier bio pharmaceutical customers.
Our growing biologics offering includes cell-line development based on our advanced and patented GPEx suite of technologies, which are used to develop stable, high-yielding mammalian cell lines for both innovator and biosimilar biologic compounds. GPEx technology can provide rapid cell-line development, high biologics production yields, flexibility, and versatility. Our development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin has the capability and capacity to produce cGMP quality biologics drug substance from 250L to 4000L scale using single-use technology to provide maximum efficiency and flexibility. Our Bloomington, Indiana facility brings additional biologics development, clinical, and commercial drug substance manufacturing, and formulation capabilities and capacity. Both Bloomington and our Anagni, Italy facility add substantial capacity for finished-dose biologics drug product manufacturing and packaging. We have continued to expand drug substance production capacity in Madison, bringing on-line fourth and fifth manufacturing suites, have expanded drug product manufacturing and packaging capacity in Bloomington and Anagni, and recently announced a planned expansion of our Anagni facility to permit drug substance development and manufacturing. Our SMARTag next-generation ADC technology, based in Emeryville, California, is a clinical-stage technology that enables development of ADCs and other protein conjugates with improved efficacy, safety, and manufacturability.
At our cell and gene therapy centers in Belgium, Maryland and Texas, we develop and manufacture complex biologics including CAR-T, AAV, lentivirus, oncolytic virus and other cell or virus modalities for cell- and viral-based therapies and next-generation vaccines. Through continued inorganic investment between November 2020 and June 2021, we acquired two additional cell and gene therapy manufacturing facilities and Delphi Genetics SA (“Delphi”), a plasmid DNA business, all located on our Gosselies campus to create a European Center of Excellence in Belgium. This campus now includes clinical through commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing and both small- and large-scale plasmid DNA production. Additionally, in August 2021, we acquired RheinCell Therapeutics GmbH (“RheinCell”) a company based in Langenfeld, Germany that specializes in “iPSC” production. This portfolio expansion strengthens Catalent’s cell therapy offering by adding proprietary cGMP iPSC cell lines and enhances our ability to manufacture next generation cell therapies at scale. In our gene therapy 
network across Maryland and Texas, we have further expanded our footprint with our construction of 5 additional commercial gene therapy suites at our Harmans commercial campus in Maryland, creating a total of 15 commercial suites, and repurposed our Rockville facility in Maryland for both small- and large-scale plasmid DNA production. Our specialized expertise in AAV vectors, the most commonly used delivery system for gene therapy, and both autologous and allogeneic cell therapy modalities, together with our expanded capabilities in plasmids, positions us to capitalize on strong and growing industry demand in the cell and gene therapy market. 
Our range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes manufacturing drug substance and filling small molecules or biologics into vials, syringes, and cartridges, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network. In addition to primary packaging, our network provides secondary packaging capabilities, including auto-injector and safety device assembly for commercial launch and life cycle management. Our Clinical Supply Services business provides a global network for clinical distribution, as well as labeling, packaging and cold chain for clinical trial and commercial supply of biotherapeutics and cell and gene therapies. Our fill and finish services are largely focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies, we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines, and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, regulatory compliance, and substantial capital requirements provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage in the market. 
We also offer biologics analytical development and testing services for large molecules, including bioassay, biophysical characterization, and cGMP release and stability testing. Our OneBio Suite provides customers the potential to seamlessly integrate drug substance, drug product, and clinical supply management for products in development, and for integrated commercial supply across both drug substance and drug product. We provide a broad range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars, biobetters, and cell and gene therapies to bring a product from gene to commercialization, faster.
Our Biologics segment represented 48%, 33% and 23% of our aggregate net revenue before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Softgel and Oral Technologies 
Through our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment, we provide formulation, development, and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or “softgels,” as well as large-scale manufacturing of oral solid dose forms for pharmaceutical and consumer health markets, along with supporting ancillary services.
Our softgel manufacturing technology was first commercialized by our predecessor in the 1930s, and we have continually enhanced the platform since then. We are the market leader in overall softgel development and manufacturing and hold the leading market position in innovator drug softgels. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, unit-dose cosmetics, and animal health medicinal preparations. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste, or oil-based formulations of active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell. In the manufacturing process, the capsules are formed, filled, and sealed simultaneously. We typically perform encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter medications, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, highly potent, and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral, and supplement business in selected regions around the world. With the 2001 introduction of our plant-derived softgel shell, Vegicaps capsules, consumer health customers have been able to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient/consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary, or cultural preferences. In recent years, we have extended this platform to pharmaceutical products via our OptiShell capsule offering. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste, and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens. 
Our large-scale cGMP manufacturing of oral solid dose forms typically includes late-stage clinical trial supplies, registration batches, and commercial production across a broad range of formats, and may also involve finished dose packaging or advanced processing of intermediates to achieve the desired clinical performance of the prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceutical product. Finished dose forms include traditional and advanced complex oral solid-doses, including coated and uncoated tablets, pellet/bead/powder-filled two-piece hard capsules, granulated powders, and other immediate and modified release forms. Advanced intermediate processing may include coating, extrusion, or spheronization to achieve specific functional outcomes, including site- or time-specific drug release, taste masking, or enhanced bioavailability. We have deep 
experience at managing complex technical transfers of clinical or commercial programs, whether from Catalent’s early development network in the Oral and Specialty Delivery segment, other contract development sites, or from customers directly.
Representative customers of Softgel and Oral Technologies include Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Procter & Gamble.
Our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment represented 25%, 34%, and 41% of our aggregate net revenue before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Oral and Specialty Delivery
Our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment provides advanced analytical and formulation development and manufacturing across a range of technologies along with integrated downstream clinical development and commercial supply solutions. The technologies cover a broad range of oral (including our proprietary fast-dissolve Zydis tablets and many bioavailability enhancement technologies for both immediate and controlled-release tablets and capsules), respiratory and inhaled dose forms, including metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nasal delivery devices. 
Our oral delivery solutions platform provides comprehensive pre-clinical screening, formulation, and analytical development, and cGMP manufacturing at both clinical and commercial scale for both traditional and advanced complex oral solid-dose formats. We have substantial proven experience in developing and scaling up orphan and rare disease oral products, especially those requiring accelerated development timelines, solubility enhancement, specialized handling (e.g., potent or controlled substance materials), complex technology transfer and specialized manufacturing processes. We provide spray drying, hot melt extrusion, micronization, and lipid formulation capabilities, all of which are used to enhance a drug’s bioavailability and clinical performance. We offer comprehensive analytical method development and scientific capabilities, including stability testing and global regulatory services to support both fully integrated development programs or standalone fee-for-service work. In recent years, we have expanded our network of early development sites focused on earlier phase compounds (i.e., pre-clinical and Phase I) to engage with more customer molecules earlier in their development, with the intent to also support these molecules downstream as they progress towards commercial approval and supply. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise, the depth and breadth of integrated services offered, as well as the reliability of our supply performance across quality and operational parameters.
We launched our ODT business in 1986 with the introduction of Zydis, a unique proprietary freeze-dried tablet that disintegrates in the mouth, without water, typically in less than three seconds. The platform is often used for drugs that benefit from rapid oral dissolution and buccal absorption and for drugs for specialized patient groups, including geriatric or pediatric populations, that have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). We can adapt the Zydis technology to a wide range of molecules and indications, including prescription treatments for a variety of central nervous system-related conditions such as migraine, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia, and also for a range of consumer healthcare products targeting broader indications such as pain or allergy relief. We continue to invest in and develop Zydis ODTs in different ways with our customers as we extend the application of the technology to new therapeutic categories, including immunotherapy, vaccines, and biologic molecule delivery. 
Our respiratory platform provides integrated molecule screening, formulation development, and commercial manufacturing services for inhaled products delivered via metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and intra-nasal sprays. Delivery of these inhaled combination device products requires specialized capabilities to account for both the molecule and the device, to ensure accurate repeatable dose delivery. 
Representative customers of Oral and Specialty Delivery include Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer, AbbVie, and Biohaven, along with many small and mid-sized emerging biopharma companies involved in the clinical development space. 
Our Oral and Specialty Delivery segment represented 17%, 22%, and 23% of our aggregate net revenue before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Clinical Supply Services 
Our Clinical Supply Services segment provides manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, and inventory management for drugs and protein and cell and gene therapy biologics in clinical trials. We offer customers flexible solutions for clinical supplies production and provide distribution and inventory management support for both simple and complex clinical trials. This includes over-encapsulation where needed; supplying placebos, comparator drug procurement, and clinical packages and kits for physicians and patients; inventory management; investigator kit ordering and fulfillment; and return supply reconciliation and reporting. We support trials in all regions of the world through our facilities and distribution network. In recent years, we have continued to expand and extend our network, with significant expansions in Kansas City, Missouri and Singapore and new facilities in California, China, and Japan. We also continue to develop new solutions for the evolving 
clinical trial environment, including FlexDirect direct-to-patient and CT Success and trial planning. We are the leading provider of integrated development solutions and one of the leading providers of clinical trial supplies. Representative customers of Clinical Supply Services include Merck KGaA, IQVIA, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Incyte Corporation.
Our Clinical Supply Services segment represented 10%, 11%, and 13% of our aggregate net revenue before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Integrated Development and Product Supply Chain Solutions 
In addition to our proprietary offerings, we are also differentiated in the market by our ability to bring together our development solutions and state-of-the-art product manufacturing to offer integrated development and product supply solutions that can be combined or tailored in many ways to enable our customers to take their drugs, biologics, and consumer health products from laboratory to market, faster. Once a product is on the market, we can provide comprehensive, integrated product supply, from the sourcing or supply of the bulk active ingredient to comprehensive manufacturing and packaging, to the testing required for release, and to cold-chain or ambient temperature distribution. The customer- and product-specific solutions we develop are flexible, scalable, and creative, so that they meet the unique needs of both large and emerging biopharma and consumer health companies and are appropriate for products of all sizes. We believe that our development and product supply solutions, such as OptiForm Solution Suite and OneBio Suite, will continue to contribute to our future growth. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, mid-size, emerging, and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and consumer health companies, along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices, and companies in adjacent industries, such as cosmetics. We have longstanding, extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. In fiscal 2021, we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 17 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally, as well as with more than 1,000 other customers. Faced with access, pricing, and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities, while reducing their fixed cost bases. Many mid-size, emerging, and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, while facing the same pricing and market pressures, have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills, technologies, and services required to bring their products to market. Consumer health companies require rapidly developed, innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fast-paced over-the-counter medication, dietary supplement, and personal care markets. These market segments are all important to our growth, but require distinct solutions, marketing and sales approaches, and market strategy. 
We follow a hybrid demand-generation organization model, with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of Catalent’s solutions, and technical specialist teams providing the in-depth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering. Our sales organization currently consists of approximately 170 full-time, experienced sales professionals, supported by inside sales and sales operations. We also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team, providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings. As part of our marketing efforts, we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and on-line advertising and publicity program. We believe that Catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers, and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us.
Global Accounts
We manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential. We recorded approximately 31% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 from these global accounts. Each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience. These account leaders, along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams, are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship. Account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization as well as operational, quality, and project management personnel to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts. 
Emerging, Specialty, and Virtual Accounts 
Emerging, specialty, and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally and account for more than two-thirds of the active drug and biologic development pipeline. Historically, many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather partner with other companies to 
formulate, develop, analyze, test, and manufacture their products. We expect them to continue to do so in the future, providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand. We expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in North America, Europe, Central and South America, and Asia. We regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles, funding status, and relationships, to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers. 
Seasonality; Fluctuations in Operation Results
Our annual financial reporting periods end on June 30. Excluding the impact from COVID-19, in fiscal 2021, as discussed further in "Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers’, annual operational maintenance periods at locations in the U.S. and Europe, the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand.
Contractual Arrangements 
We generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers, including agreements with respect to feasibility, development, supply, licenses, quality, and confidentiality. The terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements. Some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements, such as fee-for-service, unit pricing in one or more tiers, minimum volume commitments, royalties, manufacturing preparation services, profit-sharing, and fixed fees. We generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms, and, in some cases, these agreements permit us to raise or renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products. Our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities, subject in each case to negotiated exclusions. The terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years, although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods, such as 30 or 90 days. For our development solutions offerings, we may enter into master service agreements, which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings. 
Backlog 
While we generally have long-term supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years, our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future service revenues from work not yet completed. For our Softgel and Oral Technologies, Biologics, and Oral and Specialty Delivery segments, backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes, where applicable. For our Clinical Supply Services segment, backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts. Using these methods of reporting backlog, as of June 30, 2021, our backlog was $3,767 million compared to $2,282 million as of June 30, 2020, including $501 million and $425 million, respectively, related to our Clinical Supply Services segment. We expect to recognize as revenue approximately 50% of the value of the backlog in existence as of June 30, 2021 by the end of fiscal 2022.
To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. For orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period or that involve minimum volume commitments, we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers, which often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand. Because of customer ordering patterns, the matters discussed in this paragraph, and other factors, our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results. 
Manufacturing Capabilities 
We operate manufacturing facilities, development centers, and sales offices throughout the world. As of June 30, 2021, we had 56 facilities (45 geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment, with one location including both a manufacturing facility and our corporate headquarters) on four continents with approximately 7 million square feet of manufacturing, laboratory, office, and related space. Our manufacturing capabilities generally include the full suite of competencies relevant to the support of each site’s activities, including regulatory, quality assurance, and in-house validation.
We operate our manufacturing facilities and development centers in accordance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. All of these sites are registered where required with the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the EMA. In some cases, our sites are registered with multiple regulatory agencies. 
We have invested $1.37 billion in our manufacturing and development facilities since fiscal 2019 for improvements and expansions, including $686 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2021. We believe that our sites and equipment are in good condition, are well maintained, and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future, in all material respects. 
Our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety, regulatory compliance, operational excellence, continuous improvement, and process standardization across the organization. In fiscal 2021, we achieved approximately 96% on-time shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus. Our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs, including Lean Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing. 
Raw Materials 
We use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design, development, and manufacture of our products. This includes, but is not limited to, key materials such as gelatin, starch, and iota carrageenan for our Softgel and Oral Technologies segment; packaging films for our Clinical Supply Services segment; single-use production components for our Biologics segment drug substance production, and glass vials and syringes for Biologics drug product. The raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis. Globally, our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions, including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues. For example, commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (“BSE”) have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers. Any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovine-derived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from BSE could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative non-bovine-derived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation, testing and regulatory approval periods. 
We work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability. We continually evaluate alternate sources of supply, although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships, the reliability of our current supplier base, and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process, since regulators usually must approve changes to prescription product ingredient sources. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin, we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate—Our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials.” In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies, which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations."
Competition 
We compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate, including with other companies that offer conventional and advanced technologies for the development, supply, and delivery of medicinal products, clinical trials support, outsourced dose form, protein-based biologics or cell or gene therapy manufacturing, or development services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health companies based in North America, Central and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. We also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have access to more substantial resources, which could be deployed to expand their range of offerings or capacity.
Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how (where relevant), capabilities, consistency of operational performance, availability of equipment, quality, price, value, responsiveness, and speed. While we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings, and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings, we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company. 
Research and Development Costs
Our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements. Research and development costs amounted to $21 million, $21 million, and $19 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Employees 
As of June 30, 2021, we had nearly 17,300 individuals providing services to us at 56 facilities on 4 continents, of which certain employees at one of our 24 U.S. facilities are represented by a labor union, with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Some combination of national works councils, labor unions, and other labor organizations is active at all 19 of our European facilities consistent with labor environments and laws in European countries. Similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. Our management believes that our relations with our workforce are satisfactory. Most of our individual service providers are full-time employees, while slightly more than 1,400 of our workers as of June 30, 2021 are contingent workers who are either self-employed or employed by external services organizations.

 | North America | Europe | South America | Asia Pacific | Total 
Approximate number of workers as of June 30, 2021 | 10,300 | 5,400 | 1,000 | 600 | 17,300

Human Capital Management
Our employees share common goals: to put patients first and to help people around the world live better, healthier lives. Our global workforce is united by our values: Patient First, commitment to our people, customer dedication, innovation, integrity, and excellence. Together, our values provide the foundation for our culture. We believe that an engaged workforce, empowered by inclusive leaders, will unlock our full potential as a company and as a leader in our sector. Our employees’ success is Catalent’s success.
We focus on employee development, engagement, and diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) to hire, develop, and retain the best talent. As of June 30, 2021, we had nearly 17,300 individuals providing services to us globally, with women representing 44% of our employees and holding 41% of roles at the manager level or higher. In fiscal 2021, ethnically diverse talent represented 31% of our U.S. employees. Our turnover trend is decreasing year-over-year. In fiscal 2021, our total turnover rate was 8.6%, comprising 6.1% voluntary turnover and 2.5% involuntary turnover. We continue to implement and expand several initiatives to develop and engage internal talent at varying levels, which is demonstrated in part by a 10-point increase in our employee engagement score since our last company-wide survey.
We aspire to build a company where all employees can develop a fulfilling career with support from our leadership team. We believe that our diverse pool of internal talent and our employees’ passion for excellence make a difference in the way we grow and deliver results. 
Talent Acquisition
We have established strong human resources processes and practices in order to support our employees through their careers at Catalent. This starts with an aggressive recruiting strategy and a strong employer brand. We attracted more than 5,000 new employees in fiscal 2021, continuously working to reduce the time it takes to fill open positions and reduce our cost per hire, while striving for a best-in-class candidate experience.
We are committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical, dental, and vision coverage to retirement, disability, employee stock purchase, and life insurance programs, we also provide health promotion programs, remote work flexibility, tuition assistance, and employee assistance programs in several countries. 
Our recruitment strategy aims to attract talent representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and ideas. This approach includes:
•    engaging with potential top talent early in the career path through our college internship program;
•    developing future leaders through our Global Organization Leadership Development (“GOLD”) program; as discussed further below;
•    providing competitive compensation and benefits;
•    continuously improving recruitment processes and platforms; and
•    working with several recruitment partners to attract diverse profiles and advertise our open positions.
Catalent was recognized as a TOP EMPLOYER USA for 2020 and 2021. We differentiate ourselves as a preferred employer to candidates through our reputation as a great place to work, offering a fast-paced work environment and, more recently, providing an opportunity to be part of the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Talent Development
We are also committed to the growth, development, and engagement of our people once they have joined our family. Through a strong learning and development culture, we provide opportunities for specialized technical training, leadership development, and high-potential growth opportunities to endow our employees with the knowledge and expertise needed to grow their careers here. 
Our primary goal is to develop our people from within, thereby establishing a strong successor bench to help support company growth. In fiscal 2021, over 2,500 employees moved to a new role within the organization, whether as a developmental move or a promotion to a more senior position. Our senior leaders are committed to talent development and dedicate time each fiscal quarter to perform formalized talent reviews to discuss the development of key talent and to update succession plans for critical roles.
We strongly believe that the combination of experience (70%), exposure (20%), and education (10%) is the best recipe for personal development and career progression here. We have a library of tools and resources available for our employees within that framework.
We also offer three formal development programs to employees. All three programs provide excellent opportunities to identify internal candidates who can fill critical leadership and other roles with us at different levels. Through these programs, we have created a bench of leaders who model our values and are ready to take on more responsibility.

(1)    Entry-level GOLD program. The GOLD program is a two-year rotational program for recent graduates from universities around the world in which the employee participates in three rotations at different sites in our network to learn about us and our varied offerings. GOLD employees receive assignments to perform strategic roles in key business initiatives. We provide them with coaching and opportunities to interact with senior executives, which both develop the skills and experience of our GOLD employees and provide a platform through which they contribute fresh ideas that challenge the status quo. 
(2)    Manager-level Next Generation Global Leader program. Our Next Generation program for employees at the manager level is a 15-month on-the-job program focused on preparing high-potential managers for director-level roles. In fiscal 2021, we trained 42 employees through this program. 
(3)    Senior leader General Manager Excellence Program. Our general managers run our operating sites and have substantial and wide-ranging responsibilities. This program enhances the skills of our general managers by giving them exposure to industry best practices and opportunities to network internally and receive personalized career coaching.
Diversity and Inclusion
An overarching D&I commitment drives our decisions, policies, and leadership practices. We are committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equality and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to our continued success. Our commitment to these values starts at the top with a diverse board of directors and an executive management team that represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. In fiscal 2018, we established our Global Office of Diversity & Inclusion (the “D&I Office”), which oversees our D&I efforts globally. The D&I Office is supported by regional D&I committees composed of leaders at a variety of levels who oversee the implementation of local programs. 
Our D&I aspirations span the following four focus areas: culture, people, community, and marketplace. We aim to:
•foster an inclusive culture where every employee feels welcomed, valued, and respected, establishing an environment that supports employees in their careers and in their personal lives;
•prioritize recruitment and promotion strategies that create a strong, representative balance at all levels of the organization;
•deliver development programs that promote equitable career flows and compensation for all employees;
•execute rapid scale-up of foundational inclusive leadership and unconscious bias training for all employees, especially our leaders;
•enable the recognition and advancement of underserved communities through partnerships with external organizations; and
•advance D&I outside of our walls by understanding the needs of our diverse customers, implementing a robust supplier diversity program, and providing philanthropic support to organizations that serve diverse groups.
Engagement
Our employee-focused practices have had a clear impact on our employee engagement. Through increased engagement, we can grow our business by relying on strong, engaged leaders and professionals willing to ensure we can overcome and thrive during any challenge.
We periodically administer a company-wide engagement survey to garner direct feedback from our employees regarding how we can more deeply and meaningfully engage them, enabling us to focus on improving specific areas where we can support our people. In our most recent engagement survey completed in fiscal 2021, our employee engagement score improved by 10 points overall compared to the immediately prior survey taken two years earlier, with the most important improvements among the senior leadership and manager employee populations, and a notable increase in engagement as a result of our enhanced rewards and recognition programs. 
Our COVID-19 Response
We have adapted our processes and policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to support our employees, customers, and our local communities. 
We recognize that we have a unique responsibility to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and are committed to supporting and protecting our employees and their families, ensuring that our supply of COVID-19 related products and our other life-saving and life-enhancing products reach patients, contributing our scientific expertise to the development of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, and supporting health care providers and the communities in which they serve. We kept our employees safe and feeling protected by using the best-available expertise to modify our process flows and people movement, employing masks, physical barriers, and physical distancing to minimize exposure. We communicated regularly with our leaders and operating personnel regarding our actions and motivations to assure transparency and the incorporation of useful suggestions from every level of the organization. 

In fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, we implemented new virtual recruitment platforms and streamlined procedures to accelerate onboarding amid rapidly changing local restrictions. We sought to ensure the safety of new hires through training on our COVID-19 protocols and requiring COVID-19 tests for those working on-site, when permissible under local regulations. We continue to provide employees with easy and regular access to information, including details regarding our COVID-19 tracking process, guidance around hygiene measures and travel, and best practices for working from home. We also provided extensive information to support our employees as they made vaccination decisions and provided paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and paid time off if vaccination resulted in side effects.
As a result of our actions, 92% of employees responding to our COVID-19 survey in fiscal 2021 expressed the view that we are demonstrating care and concern for our employees through our actions and policies.
Corporate Responsibility and our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Strategy 
Our mission to help people live better, healthier lives drives our culture and inspires us. To us, corporate responsibility (“CR”) starts with our nearly 17,300 workers, who live our Patient First culture and work to deliver on our responsibility to timely develop and reliably supply products to patients, whether for a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment or the more than 70 billion doses we produce every year on behalf of our customers and their patients. 
In the wake of significant change and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on the critical importance of our mission and values to orient us. We prioritized people and patients in our decisions as we adapted rapidly to meet the needs of an ever-evolving pandemic. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic for our employees and for our customers and global community, coupled with our focus on social justice, have made us stronger and more cohesive. We connected even 
more deeply with our employees and communities, executed with excellence under stress, and kept our people safe, while accelerating our services, talents, and capabilities to serve our customers and their patients.
Our CR strategy, which includes our strategy related to ESG matters, is integrated into our company-wide strategic plan, ensuring that we operate in alignment with our values, meet our commitments to all our stakeholders, and contribute to the long-term success of the broader pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries and the communities where we operate. We continue to invest in a corporate culture that understands and prioritizes our impact on people in our daily operations and decision-making strategies.
Our approach to ESG focuses on three areas of society relevant to our business, prioritizing our impact on people, the environment, and our communities. We focus on ESG areas that are the most significant to our business, and our strategy is informed by our employees, customers, investors, communities, and other key stakeholders.
We established the Office of Corporate Responsibility in fiscal 2017 and created a formal governance structure through our CR Council, which guides the implementation of our ESG strategy and now reports on a regular cadence to our board of directors. We continuously assess the maturity and performance of our CR programs at each of our operating segments and sites through a scorecard system. Our leaders are held accountable for our CR goals, including those focused on strengthening our environmental and social efforts. 
Governance
We are committed to ensuring strong corporate governance practices on behalf of our shareholders and other stakeholders. We believe strong corporate governance and an independent board of directors provide the foundation for financial integrity and shareholder confidence. More information about our corporate governance features can be found in our Proxy Statement for the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Proxy Statement”), which will be filed within 120 days after June 30, 2021, the close of our fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.
In addition, as noted above, we have established a CR Council composed of senior leaders from various parts of our business to guide our CR efforts and set our overall CR strategy. Our board of directors regularly reviews aspects of our CR strategy and performance as a full board and through its several committees, including an annual review of our overall CR strategy and performance.
Business Benefits
Beyond being the right thing to do, our focus on CR strengthens our business by reducing risks, meeting customer and investor expectations, and attracting top talent. CR performance is an important contributor to our business success. It informs our risk management process, protects our reputation, and alerts us to regulatory, environmental, and societal threats to our business. Our CR activities also align with many of our customers’ CR programs and strengthens our relationships with our customers.
Our future success depends on our highly skilled and dedicated global workforce, who are passionate about improving health outcomes. We compete for talent in our industry and recognize that our culture and reputation as a responsible company can be a differentiator in attracting candidates and retaining our employees. According to the last two engagement surveys we conducted, D&I and CR are two of the highest-rated engagement elements of our culture. While we are transparent about the progress we still need to make, our commitment energizes our employees and makes them proud. 
Our customers and our investors regularly ask us to join them in their own ESG commitments, especially in the areas of environmental sustainability and D&I, reflected in the increasing number of business reviews and surveys dedicated to our ESG commitments and progress. We understand that our stakeholders want to know that we share their values. Our ESG strategy drives us to provide concrete evidence of our commitment to our ESG values, which strengthens our relationships with customers and other stakeholders. 
ESG progress in fiscal 2021
We made significant progress in several ESG focus areas in fiscal 2021.
In May 2021, we published our second annual CR report, informed by the requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals and covering ESG issues that include: quality, safety, innovation, environmental sustainability and climate change, D&I, and community investment and philanthropy. The CR report, which covers our fiscal year 2020, describes how we extended and deepened our CR commitments as part of our long-term corporate strategy. Some of our highlighted progress includes:
•the development of our first human rights statement and commencement of a third-party assessment, a critical element of our emerging responsible supply chain initiative that aims to align our 10,000-plus suppliers with our industry’s standards for responsible, reliable, and sustainable partnership;
•our commitment to new targets for waste and water reduction, including our pledge to ensure that none of our sites discharge wastewater with API concentrations above Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs), which standards often exceed current regulatory requirements;
•the transition of six more sites to 100% renewable electricity, for a total of 12 sites with 100% renewable electricity, a number that will continue to grow, and as of July 1, 2021, covered 97% of our electricity usage across our global network; and
•our largest-ever fiscal year philanthropic contribution total, with a substantial portion of our gifts focused on our response to the interconnected COVID-19 and social inequality crises.
Over the past year, we further integrated our employee resource groups (“ERGs”) into our diverse talent acquisition and talent development efforts. ERGs are groups of volunteer employees who join together based on shared characteristics or life experiences and serve as a resource for talent development, employee engagement, enhancing a sense of belonging, informing others in the Company regarding their unique challenges, perspectives, and achievements, and fostering a diverse, inclusive workplace aligned with organizational goals. 
We also deepened the relationships we have with potential sources of talent and other HR providers to continue to enhance our diverse talent recruitment, engagement, and development initiatives. 
We share our global gender statistics and U.S. ethnicity statistics in our CR report. We are transparent about the progress made and the work still to be done in these areas of focus. 
Looking ahead
As a leader in a growing industry, we understand the need to demonstrate our shared commitment, sense of urgency, and value in contributing to the responsibility and long-term sustainability of the entire pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. We continue to progress against our sustainability, responsible supply chain, human rights, and D&I goals and plan for future progress in these focus areas.
This is especially true for environmental sustainability. In fiscal 2021, we achieved our current carbon reduction commitment, and are now setting new, science-based Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction targets, in alignment with global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Effective July 1, 2021, 97% of our electricity usage across our global network is procured from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. We will purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) for all of our sites operating in North America, South America, and Europe, as well as the majority of its sites in Asia.
Our Chair and CEO also recently signed a letter of commitment with the Science-Based Target Initiative, adding us to a growing list of companies setting actionable, science-based, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission reduction targets to limit global warming. This commitment will include calculating and reducing direct and indirect emissions, even as we continue to evolve and grow. Sourcing the majority of our electricity from renewable sources will contribute to our overall GHG reduction efforts and is a milestone step towards doing our part in the global community and meeting our SBT commitment. We will publicize our new GHG reduction targets in our next, fiscal 2021 CR report. Our Scope 3 targets will take longer to assess and establish.
As part of our emerging “responsible supplier’ initiative, we will implement recommendations from our current human rights assessment, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We will require our key direct material suppliers to complete a self-assessment that includes questions on ethics and labor, and will rate them for human rights risks based on the quality of the self-assessments, their country of operation, type of business, and information in the public domain. Additionally, select suppliers will be subject to ongoing monitoring for human rights risk violations under our third-party vetting and due diligence program.
Finally, measuring against our baseline D&I statistics, we are progressing on our goal to recruit more diverse talent, especially in leadership roles. Through training, hosting internal forums, and establishing internal performance metrics, we are counter-acting the unconscious bias that too often blinds us from hiring and promoting the diverse talent available to us. Employee surveys tell us that our people are energized and engaged by our CR and D&I initiatives. Therefore, in addition to 
closing critical talent gaps, we aim to continue to inspire and motivate our people even more in our journey towards a more diverse and inclusive Catalent.

Intellectual Property 
We use a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect certain innovative aspects of our offerings, services, and intangible assets that we have developed. These proprietary rights can be important to aspects of our ongoing operations. Many of our operations and products are covered by intellectual property licenses from third parties, particularly our customers that provide licenses to their proprietary active ingredients or formulations as part of our development or supply agreements with them, and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties. 
We also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business, and, to further encourage active innovation, we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and non-scientists alike. We have applied in the U.S. and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks, and patents, some of which have been registered and issued, and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks. We hold more than 1,300 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies, as well as manufacturing and other areas relevant to our business. 
We hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations, pharmaceutical and nutritional dosage forms, mammalian cell engineering, antibody-drug conjugation and plasmid manufacturing. We also hold patents relating to certain processes and products. We have pending patent applications in the U.S. and certain other countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate. We have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and worldwide in appropriate circumstances. 
We do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise, or concession to be material to our overall business. 
Regulatory Matters 
The manufacture, distribution, and marketing of healthcare products and the provision of certain services for development-stage pharmaceutical and biotechnology products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, other U.S. governmental authorities, and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits or licenses with, and must comply with the operating, cGMP, quality, and security standards of, applicable domestic and foreign healthcare regulators, including the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “DHHS”), the equivalent agencies of the European Union (the “E.U.”) and its member states, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions, as well as various accrediting bodies, each depending upon the type of operations and the locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries. 
In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to other healthcare laws, including the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and comparable state and foreign laws and regulations in certain of their activities.
We are also subject to various federal, state, local, national, and transnational laws, regulations, and requirements, both in the U.S. and other countries, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and distribution practices, and the use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, applicable import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the cross-border transit of finished goods, raw materials, and supplies and the handling of information. We are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our non-U.S. operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records. 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal, state, local, national, and transnational regulations could be significant, and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate—Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements, including changing standards or changing interpretations of existing standards, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers. In addition, changes to our procedures or additional procedures, implemented to comply with public health 
orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations,” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations. 
In fiscal 2021, we were subject to 52 regulatory audits, and, over the last five fiscal years, we completed approximately 300 regulatory audits. 
Quality Assurance 
We are committed to ensuring and maintaining the highest standard of regulatory compliance while providing high quality products to our customers, supported by our core value of Patient First. To meet these commitments, we have developed and implemented a Catalent-wide quality management system. We have employees around the globe focusing on quality and regulatory compliance. Our senior management team is actively involved in setting quality policies, standards, and internal position papers as well as managing internal and external quality performance. Our quality assurance department provides quality leadership and supervises our quality systems programs. An internal audit program monitors compliance with applicable regulations, standards, and internal policies. In addition, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA, and other equivalent local, state, and foreign regulatory authorities as well as our customers. All FDA, DEA, and other regulatory inspectional observations have been resolved or are on track to be completed at the prescribed timeframe provided in commitments to the applicable agency in all material respects. We believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the regulations under which our facilities are governed. 
Environmental, Health & Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (“OSHA”), and equivalent state, local, and national regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination, and employee health and safety. Our manufacturing facilities use, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in their processes. These substances include, among others, chlorinated solvents, and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities, including a number we no longer own or operate. As at our current facilities, contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us, for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed. We believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the environment, health, and safety regulations applicable to our facilities.
