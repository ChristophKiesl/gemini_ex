Item 1. Business
Overview
Forward Air (“Forward”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a leading asset-light freight and logistics company. We provide less-than-truckload (“LTL”), final mile, truckload and intermodal drayage services across the United States and in Canada. We offer premium services that typically require precision execution, such as expedited transit, delivery during tight time windows and special handling. We utilize an asset-light strategy to minimize our investments in equipment and facilities and to reduce our capital expenditures. Forward Air was formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Tennessee on October 23, 1981. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FWRD”.
Discontinued Operation
Table of Contents

On April 23, 2020, the Board approved a strategy to divest our Pool Distribution segment (“Pool”) within the next year. Pool provides high-frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations within a specific geographic region. Pool offers this service throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest United States. Accordingly, Pool has been classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and for all prior periods presented. Pool assets and liabilities are reflected as “Assets and liabilities held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in this Form 10-K. In addition, the results of operations for Pool have been presented in this Form 10-K as a discontinued operation and as a result, unless otherwise noted, the discussion in this Form 10-K only focuses on results of continuing operations. The sale of Pool was consummated on February 12, 2021.
Ransomware Incident
In December 2020, we detected a ransomware incident impacting our operational and information technology systems, which caused service delays for many of our customers (“Ransomware Incident”). Promptly upon our detection of the incident, we initiated response protocols, launched an investigation and engaged the services of cybersecurity and forensics professionals. We have also engaged with the appropriate law enforcement authorities. We continue to cooperate with law enforcement in connection with the criminal investigation into those responsible for the Ransomware Incident.
Services Provided
Our services are classified into two reportable segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal. For financial information relating to each of our business segments, see Note 11, Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Expedited Freight. We operate a comprehensive national network to provide expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services. Expedited Freight offers customers local pick-up and delivery and other services including final mile, truckload, shipment consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, customs brokerage and other handling. We plan to grow our LTL and final mile geographic footprints through greenfield start-ups as well as acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Expedited Freight accounted for 84.5% of our consolidated revenue.
Intermodal. We provide first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and Container Freight Station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. Today, Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller operational presence in the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic United States. We plan to grow Intermodal’s geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as greenfield start-ups where we do not have an acceptable acquisition target. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Intermodal accounted for 15.7% of our consolidated revenue.
Strategy
Our strategy is to take advantage of our core competencies in precision execution to provide asset-light freight and logistics services in order to profitably grow in the premium segments of the markets we serve. Principal components of our efforts include:
•Expand Service Offerings. We believe we can increase freight volumes and revenues by offering new and enhanced services that address more of our customers’ premium transportation needs. In the past few years, we have added or enhanced LTL pickup and delivery, final mile solutions, expedited truckload, temperature-controlled shipments, warehousing, drayage, customs brokerage and shipment consolidation and handling services. These services benefit our existing customers and increase our ability to attract new customers. We also believe we can increase freight volumes by providing services to customers like third-party logistics companies and international freight forwarders that have historically represented a small percentage of our customer base and by opening new terminals in under penetrated markets away from airport locations.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions that support our growth strategy that involves organic infrastructure investments, as well as inorganic investments, including acquisitions of complementary businesses. In 2014 we created the foundation for what is our Intermodal segment by acquiring Central States Trucking Co. (“CST”). Since the acquisition of CST, we have completed ten additional intermodal acquisitions including O.S.T. Trucking, Inc. and O.S.T. Logistics Inc. (collectively, “O.S.T.”) in July 2019 and Value Logistics, Inc. (“Value Logistics”) in October 2020. In order to enhance our final mile footprint, we acquired FSA Network, Inc. (“FSA”) in April 2019, Linn Star Holdings, Inc., Linn Star Transfer, Inc. and Linn 
Table of Contents

Star Logistics, LLC (collectively, “Linn Star”) in January 2020 and CLW Delivery, Inc. (“CLW”) in October 2020. 
•Enhance Information Systems. We are committed to the development and enhancement of our information systems in order to provide us competitive service advantages and increased productivity. We believe our information systems have and will assist us in capitalizing on new business opportunities with existing and new customers.
Operations
The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal.
Expedited Freight
Overview
Our Expedited Freight segment provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL, final mile and truckload services. We market our Expedited Freight services primarily to freight and logistics intermediaries (such as freight forwarders and third-party logistics companies), airlines (such as integrated air cargo carriers, and passenger and cargo airlines) and retailers (such as retailers of heavy bulky appliances). We offer our customers a high level of service with a focus on on-time, damage-free deliveries. Our Expedited Freight network encompasses approximately 92% of all continental U.S. zip codes, with service in Canada.
Shipments
During 2020, approximately 29% of the freight handled by our LTL network was for overnight delivery, approximately 57% was for delivery within two to three days and the balance was for delivery in four or more days.
The average weekly volume of freight moving through our LTL network was approximately 46.3 million pounds per week in 2020. During 2020, our average shipment weighed approximately 605 pounds. Although we impose no significant size or weight restrictions, we focus our marketing and price structure on shipments of 200 pounds or more.
Expedited Freight generally does not market its services directly to shippers (where such services might compete with our freight and logistics intermediary customers). Also, because Expedited Freight does not place significant size or weight restrictions on shipments, we generally do not compete directly with integrated air cargo carriers such as United Parcel Service and FedEx Corporation in the overnight delivery of small parcels.
The table below summarizes the average weekly volume of freight moving through our LTL network for each year since 2006.

Transportation
Expedited Freight’s licensed motor carrier contracts with independent contractor fleets, owner-operators and other third-party transportation capacity providers for most of its transportation services. Our independent contractor fleet owners and owner-operators lease their equipment to the Company’s motor carrier (“Leased Capacity Providers”) and own, operate and maintain their own tractors and employ their own drivers. Our freight handlers load and unload our trailers and vehicles for hauling by our Leased Capacity Providers between our terminals. 
We seek to establish long-term relationships with Leased Capacity Providers to assure dependable service and availability. We believe Expedited Freight has experienced significantly higher average retention of Leased Capacity Providers compared to other over-the-road transportation providers. Expedited Freight has established specific guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal evaluations that we use to select our Leased Capacity Providers. To enhance our relationship with the Leased Capacity Providers, Expedited Freight seeks to pay rates that are generally above prevailing market rates and our Leased Capacity Providers often are able to negotiate a consistent work schedule for their drivers. Usually, Leased Capacity Providers negotiate schedules for their drivers that are between the same two cities or along a consistent route, improving quality of work life for the drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers and, in turn, increasing the retention rate of Leased Capacity Providers.
As a result of efforts to expand our logistics and other services, and in response to seasonal demands and volume surges in particular markets, we also purchase transportation from other surface transportation providers to handle overflow volume. Of the $583.5 million incurred for Expedited Freight's transportation during 2020, we purchased 44% from the Leased Capacity Providers of our licensed motor carrier, 35% from our company fleet and 21% from other surface transportation providers.
All of our Expedited Freight independent contractor tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices, which enable us to communicate with drivers, plan and monitor shipment progress and monitor and record drivers’ hours of service. We use the real-time global positioning data obtained from these devices to improve customer and driver service.
Other Services
Expedited Freight continues to evolve the capabilities of its network to provide additional value-added services. Expedited Freight also seeks to lower its unit costs by integrating these services into the overall operation of its network.
Expedited Freight offers final mile services which include the delivery and installation of heavy bulky appliances such as washing machines, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators. Through the acquisition of FSA Logistix in 2019 and acquisition of Linn Star in January 2020, Expedited Freight significantly expanded its final mile geographic footprint and now operates in 109 
Table of Contents

locations nationwide. Expedited Freight is also increasingly integrating these deliveries into its LTL pickup and delivery and terminal operations so as to increase network density and lower overall LTL unit costs.
Expedited Freight offers truckload services which include expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high security and temperature-controlled logistics services.
Other Expedited Freight services allow customers to access the following services from a single source:
•customs brokerage;
•warehousing, dock and office space;
•hotshot or ad hoc ultra-expedited services; and
•shipment consolidation and handling, such as shipment build-up and break-down and reconsolidation of air or ocean pallets or containers.
Customers
Our Expedited Freight wholesale customer base is primarily comprised of freight forwarders, third-party logistics (“3PL”) companies, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger, cargo airlines, steamship lines and retailers. Expedited Freight’s freight forwarder customers vary in size from small, independent, single facility companies to large, international logistics companies. Our dependable service and wide-ranging service offerings also make Expedited Freight an attractive option for 3PL providers, which is one of the fastest growing segments in the transportation industry. Because we deliver dependable service, integrated air cargo carriers use our network to provide overflow capacity and other services, including shipment of bigger packages and pallet-loaded cargo. In 2020, Expedited Freight’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 59% of its operating revenue and had one customer with revenue greater than 10% of Expedited Freight operating revenue for 2020. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.
Intermodal
Overview
Our Intermodal segment provides first- and last-mile high value intermodal container drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads. Intermodal also offers dedicated contract and container freight station (“CFS”) warehouse and handling services. Today, Intermodal operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with smaller operational presence in Southwest and Mid-Atlantic United States. We plan to expand beyond our current geographic footprint through acquisitions as well as greenfield start-ups where no suitable acquisition is available. Intermodal also provides linehaul and local less-than-truckload service in the Midwest, as well as CFS warehousing services (e.g. devanning, unit load device build-up/tear-down, and security screening) for air and ocean import/export freight at five (5) of its Midwest terminals (Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit). Our Intermodal service differentiators include:
•Immediate proof of delivery (“POD”) and Signature Capture capability via tablets;
•All drivers receive dispatch orders on hand-held units and are trackable via GPS; and
•Daily container visibility and per diem management reports.
Operations
Intermodal’s primary office is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. Intermodal’s network consists of 24 locations primarily in the Midwest and Southeast, with a smaller operational presence in the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic United States. 
Transportation
Intermodal utilizes a mix of Company-employed drivers, Leased Capacity Providers and third-party carriers. During 2020, approximately 73% of Intermodal’s direct transportation expenses were provided by Leased Capacity Providers, 24% by Company-employed drivers, and 3% by third-party carriers.
All of our Intermodal company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with computer tablets, which enable us to communicate with our drivers, plan and monitor shipment progress and monitor our drivers’ hours of service. We use the real-time global positioning data obtained from these devices to improve customer and driver service and provide a high level of shipment visibility to our customers (including immediate POD signature capture). We believe that our technology is a key differentiator and enables us to provide a higher level of service than our competitors.
Table of Contents

Customers
Intermodal’s customer base is primarily comprised of international freight forwarders, passenger and cargo airlines, beneficial cargo owners and steamship lines. In 2020, Intermodal’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 32% of its operating revenue and had no customers with revenue greater than 10% of Intermodal operating revenue for 2020.
Competition
We compete in the North American transportation and logistics services industry, and the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, very fragmented and historically have few barriers to entry. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers. To a lesser extent, we also compete with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger airlines. Our competition ranges from small operators that compete within a limited geographic area to companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater freight capacity.
Our Expedited Freight segment primarily competes with other national and regional truckload carriers. Expedited Freight also competes with less-than-truckload carriers, and to a lesser extent, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger and cargo airlines. Our Intermodal segment primarily competes with national and regional drayage providers.
We believe competition in our segments is based primarily on quality service, available capacity, on-time delivery, flexibility, reliability, security, transportation rates, location of facilities, and business relationships, and we believe we compete favorably with other transportation service companies. To that end, we believe our Expedited Freight segment has an advantage over other truckload and less-than-truckload carriers because Expedited Freight delivers faster, more reliable services between cities at rates that are generally significantly below the charge to transport the same shipments to the same destinations by air. We believe our Intermodal segment has a competitive advantage over other drayage providers because we deliver faster, more reliable service while offering greater shipment visibility and security. Additionally, we believe our Intermodal segment is one of the leading providers of drayage and related services in North America today. 
Marketing
We market all of our services through a sales and marketing staff located in major markets of the United States. Senior management also is actively involved in sales and marketing at the national and local account levels. We participate in trade shows and advertise our services through direct mail programs and through the Internet via www.forwardaircorp.com, www.forwardair.com, www.forwardairsolutions.com and www.cstruck.com. We market our services through all of our websites. The information contained on our websites is not part of this filing and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.
Seasonality
Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. Typically, this pattern has been the result of factors such as economic conditions, customer demand, weather, and national holidays. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by the economy.
Workforce
We recognize that our workforce, including our freight handlers, is our most valuable asset. We strive to put people at the center of everything we do by empowering our workforce to improve their lives and realize their full potential. The recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees are essential to support our continued growth and to meet the service requirements of our customers.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,774 full-time employees, 918 of whom were freight handlers and an additional 370 part-time employees, the majority of whom were freight handlers. In 2020, none of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Roadway Health and Safety
Table of Contents

We are committed to educating our people and promoting driver health and wellness through routine communication campaigns and information designed to improve knowledge and produce safer results. Drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers complete a three-day safety orientation as part of their onboarding where they are assigned several training courses. Safety trainings may also be assigned on an ongoing basis, based on driving behaviors.
We invest in a variety of programs focused on improving and maintaining driver health and wellness. We provide drivers access to a fatigue management service with the goal of reducing fatigue-related accidents and encouraging healthy, restful sleep. We have implemented fleet safety equipment, including electronic monitoring systems, to track driver safety, well-being, and health through monitoring of speed and proper hours-of-service-required rest breaks.
We provide a quarterly safety bonus and annual vehicle giveaway to incentivize our Leased Capacity Providers to promote safe driving practices. These initiatives celebrate drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers who have zero moving violations or accidents each quarter. Drivers who obtain four quarterly bonuses are eligible to win a new vehicle. In 2020, 325 divers qualified for the vehicle giveaway, a 172% increase since the inception of the program in 2018. Looking ahead, we will continue to identify and promote opportunities to adopt health and wellness practices for the drivers of our Leased Capacity Providers.
Workplace Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining safe facilities for our employees and independent contractors. We are also committed to evaluating our practices and training our employees and independent contractors to prevent workplace incidents.
Beyond our roadway safety focus, we employ, maintain, and monitor a robust health and safety program for all of our workers, which establishes procedures and policies to prevent workplace incidents. Policies and procedures exist to investigate accidents and monitor lessons learned, driving continuous improvement in the health and safety practices across our facilities. All of our employees are assigned to 36 training courses as part of onboarding and employees may be assigned additional refresher trainings based on corrective action or identified risk.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment than we have today. Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace begins at the top, starting with our Board. Diversity in race, ethnicity, and gender are important factors in evaluating candidates for board nominees and since July 2017, we have added three female directors to our Board. We believe diverse backgrounds and experiences are important to provide a range of perspectives to overcome challenges, improve business performance, and support good decision making. 
The skills and talents of our diverse workforce drive our performance and we respect the value they bring to our business. We strive for a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone can contribute and thrive. We have an ongoing commitment to ensure we have a diverse workforce and Board presence. We understand that a welcoming workplace attracts top talent, which drives performance and profitability. We seek candidates from all backgrounds, to continue to build our industry’s most qualified workforce.
In 2020, we created a Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) Council to promote employee inclusion and engagement through initiatives that celebrate the diversity of our employees. As an organization that puts people at the center of everything we do, our vision is increased employee engagement and retention in part through enhanced D&I practices. Our assessment identified several D&I improvement activities that foster an inclusive environment:
•Incorporate additional D&I training into our education programs for employees and leadership.
•Engage our employees in the celebration of diversity. We plan to launch a series of Employee Resource Groups to foster an inclusive environment and better understand our colleagues’ backgrounds.
•Assess our current benefits program to identify improvement opportunities to support our increasingly diverse employees’ unique needs. 
Our employees are also offered three D&I trainings throughout the year, Understanding Diversity, Generational Awareness, and Emotional Intelligence.

Compensation and Benefits
One of the most important ways we support our employees and their families is through a comprehensive benefits package for all full-time employees. Our employees have access to the following:
•Competitive Benefits. We provide a strong benefit package to employees that includes health care insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, Company-paid life insurance, paid time off, Company-paid holidays, family medical leave, and a 401(k) with a Company match.
•Wellness Program. The Employee Wellness Program provides access to annual medical screenings and health fairs, at no cost to the employee, to help keep employees healthy. Additionally, the Employee Wellness Program provides discounted gym memberships, free weight loss and smoking cessation programs, a healthy pregnancy program with incentives, and an Employee Assistance program. 
•Work / Life Balance. We understand that a work / life balance is important to our employees. We are consistently improving our paid time off benefits for all of our employees, which allows us to retain and recruit quality employees.
Beyond our benefits package, career advancement has always been at the forefront for our employees and we truly pride ourselves with being able to promote from within. Our continuous learning workshops range from customer service to leadership and beyond. We strive to provide meaningful development opportunities for 100% of our employee population.
Equipment
We manage a trailer pool that is utilized by all of our reportable segments to move freight through our networks. Our trailer pool includes dry van, refrigerated and roller-bed trailers, and substantially all of our trailers are 53 feet long. We own the majority of the trailers we use, but we supplement at times with leased trailers. As of December 31, 2020, we had 6,009 owned trailers in our fleet with an average age of approximately five years. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we also had 162 leased trailers in our fleet. As of December 31, 2020, we had 232 owned tractors and straight trucks in our fleet, with an average age of approximately eight years. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we also had 567 leased tractors and straight trucks in our fleet.
Environmental Protection and Community Support
At Forward, we embrace a comprehensive definition of sustainability that addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance factors (“ESG”). To our employees, our communities, our customers, our suppliers, and our investors, each impact area matters.
In 2019, Forward’s Board amended the Corporate Governance and Nominating (“CG&N”) Committee Charter to oversee our efforts related to environmental, social, and governance matters, and management of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. At least twice a year, the CG&N Committee is updated on each of these topics and provides feedback and recommendations that it deems appropriate.
At the beginning of 2020, Forward’s leadership created and staffed the Head of Corporate ESG role to provide oversight of Forward’s ESG vision, strategic planning, performance management and improvement activities. Shortly after, Forward initiated an ESG market analysis and benchmarking exercise that explored the ESG issues that most impact transportation and logistics industries and marketplaces.
In second quarter of 2020, we began to conduct an ESG assessment, starting with a third-party stakeholder assessment that served as a basis for identifying and prioritizing ESG topics most relevant to our industry, our business, and our stakeholders. The assessment’s findings yielded initial topics that we recognized as important. We followed with a more in-depth assessment of risks and opportunities, utilizing Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards as a guide, in order to further refine our disclosure topics and gain stakeholder alignment. SASB identifies Forward as part of the “Airfreight and Logistics” industry; we decided to also incorporate the disclosure topics under “Road Transportation” to assure that all relevant topics for our business were represented in this analysis.
This more detailed assessment yielded clarity of our ESG topics and prioritization based on the degree of both qualitative and quantitative impact to our business. We identified ten ESG topic priority areas relevant to Forward’s business and mapped each to widely adopted ESG reporting standards as identified by SASB. Within these ten topic areas, we identified specific related risks and opportunities, and aligned on improvement activities.
Table of Contents

The following are the ten ESG topic priority areas we identified relevant to our business and the foundation for our sustainability approach:
•Roadway Health & Safety; Workplace Health & Safety; Independent Contractor Practices; Diversity & Inclusion Practices; Community Impact & Partnerships; Measure & Disclose; Information Security; Responsible Supplier Practices; GHG Emissions Reduction Practices; and Air Quality Practices
Beyond our roadway safety focus, Forward employs, maintains, and monitors a robust Health and Safety program for all of our workers which establishes procedures and policies to prevent workplace incidents. As part of our assessment, we have identified improvement activities to develop a comprehensive Emergency Preparedness Plan (“EPP”) for all our facilities. The EPP is under development and in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910 standards and FMCSA 49 CFR. When completed in 2021, we will distribute and maintain this EPP for employees and independent contractors alike, across our facilities and corporate offices.
We are committed to supporting and giving back to the communities where we live and work, particularly through the support of our employee Veterans, and to the community of Veterans in North America.
We continue to support our Veterans through our charitable organization, Operation: Forward Freedom, a manifestation of our Company’s ongoing commitment to Veteran-related causes. Operation Forward Freedom’s largest fundraising event is intended to be The Inaugural Drive for Hope Golf tournament. In 2020, the Inaugural Drive For Hope Golf Tournament was postponed due to COVID-19.
We also partner with non-profit organizations that positively impact our communities and our industry. Through our partnership with Truckers Against Trafficking, we have conducted training for over-the-road drivers to educate and equip them with the tools needed to combat human trafficking.
Forward partners with Women in Trucking to encourage and promote the employment of women within our industry. Our team of drivers is currently comprised of 15% women, roughly twice the U.S. industry average, and we continue to seek opportunities to improve upon that percentage.
Forward is committed to promoting a healthier natural environment by striving for continuous environmental improvements in all aspects of our business.
Forward is currently reducing emissions and energy consumption through several ongoing programs, including:
•installation of LED lighting in various facilities;
•installation of skirts on all of our trailers to improve fuel efficiency; and
•and employment of electric forklifts for our intermodal and final mile facilities.
Forward is also aligning with industry certifications, continuing to be a SmartWay certified company. SmartWay is a certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) verifying company compliance with EPA regulations, including fuel efficiency ranges and emission standards.
We recognize the value in describing our sustainability focus and plan to publish our first ESG report in the first quarter of 2021. We are committed to making our results count across the country and will continue to update our future disclosures accordingly.
Risk Management and Litigation
Under DOT regulations, we are liable for bodily injury and property damage caused by Leased Capacity Providers and employee drivers while they are operating equipment under our various motor carrier authorities. The potential liability associated with any accident can be severe and occurrences are unpredictable. 
For vehicle liability, we retain a portion of the risk. Below is a summary of our risk retention on vehicle liability insurance coverage maintained by us through $10.0 million (in millions):
Table of Contents


 | Risk Retention | | Frequency | Layer | Policy Term 
Expedited Freight¹ | | | | | 
LTL business | $ | 3.00 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $3.0 | 10/1/2020 to 10/1/2021
Truckload business | $ | 2.00 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $2.0 | 10/1/2020 to 10/1/2021
LTL and Truckload businesses | $ | 6.00 | | Policy Term Aggregate³ | $3.0 to $5.0 | 10/1/2020 to 10/1/2021
LTL and Truckload businesses | $ | 5.00 | | Policy Term Aggregate³ | $5.0 to $10.0 | 10/1/2020 to 10/1/2021
Intermodal | $ | 0.25 | | Occurrence/Accident² | $0 to $0.25 | 4/1/2020 to 10/1/2021 

¹ Excluding the Final Mile business, which is primarily a brokered service.
² For each and every accident, we are responsible for damages and defense up to these amounts, regardless of the number of claims associated with any accident.
³ During the Policy Term, we are responsible for damages and defense within the stated Layer up to the stated, aggregate amount of Risk Retention before insurance will respond. 
Also, from time to time, when brokering freight, we may face claims for the “negligent selection” of outside, contracted carriers that are involved in accidents, and we maintain third-party liability insurance coverage with a $0.1 million deductible per occurrence for most of our brokered services. Additionally, we maintain workers’ compensation insurance with a self-insured retention of $0.5 million per occurrence. We cannot guarantee that our self-insurance retention levels will not increase and/or that we may have to agree to more unfavorable policy terms as a result of market conditions, poor claims experience or other factors. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance. Any claims beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on us. Because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses.
From time to time, we are a party to litigation arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation
We are regulated by various United States and state agencies, including the DOT. The DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), an agency within the DOT, manages a Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative (“CSA”) which governs matters such as safety requirements and compliance, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, drivers’ hours of service (“HOS”) requirements, and certain mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions. We are also subject to laws and regulations under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulate safety, the supervision of hazardous materials, water discharges, air emissions, solid waste disposal and the release and cleanup of other substances. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials, certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting. The trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities, which address matters such as: increasingly stringent environmental, occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size, ergonomics, port security, and hours of service. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and our domestic customs brokerage operations are licensed by CBP.
We are also subject to employment laws and regulations, including the changing regulatory landscape, with the potential effects of California Assembly Bill 5 (“California AB5”), which introduced a new test for determining worker classification that is viewed as expanding the scope of employee relationships and narrowing the scope of independent contractor relationships.
Table of Contents

Additionally, our Canada business activities are subject to similar requirements imposed by the laws and regulations of Canada, as well as its provincial laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements, and changes in regulatory requirements, may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services.
