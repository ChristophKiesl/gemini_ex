Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 The Company is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (Predecessor IMAX). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 
 GENERAL 
 The Company is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAXs theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world. 
 The Companys principal businesses are: 
 

 | the design and manufacture of premium theater systems (IMAX theater systems) and the sale, lease or contribution of those systems to customers under theater system arrangements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Digital Re-Mastering of films into the IMAX format and the exhibition of those films in the IMAX theater network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IMAX theater systems are based on proprietary and patented technology developed over the course of the Companys 49-year history. The Companys customers who purchase, lease or otherwise acquire the IMAX theater systems through joint revenue sharing arrangements are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own IMAX theaters, but licenses the use of its trademarks along with the sale, lease or contribution of the IMAX theater system. The Company refers to all theaters using the IMAX theater system as IMAX theaters. 
 IMAX theater systems combine: 
 

 | IMAX DMR (Digital Re-Mastering) movie conversion technology, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewers peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Together these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 
 As a result of the immersiveness and superior image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience, the Companys exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box-office for the Companys exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box-office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films. 
 The Company believes the IMAX theater network is one of the most extensive premium theater networks in the world with 1,215 theater systems (1,123 commercial, 92 institutional) operating in 75 countries as at December 31, 2016. This compares to 1,061 theater systems (962 commercial, 99 institutional) operating in 67 countries as at December 31, 2015. The success of the Companys digital and joint revenue sharing strategies and the strength of its film slate have enabled the Companys theater network to expand significantly since 2008, upon the introduction of the Companys xenon-based digital projection system, with the Companys overall network increasing by 306% and its commercial network increasing by 527% since such time. In 2016 and 2015, the Company signed theater agreements for 319 and 138 theater systems, respectively, which are expected to drive additional growth in the Companys theater network in 2017 and thereafter.

The Company believes that over time its commercial multiplex theater network could grow to approximately 2,450 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,107 commercial multiplex IMAX theaters in operation as of December 31, 2016. While the Company continues to grow in the United States and Canada, it believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As at December 31, 2016, 63.7% of IMAX theater systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), up from 58.5% as at December 31, 2015, and approximately 87.8% of IMAX theater systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets, compared to 88.2% as at December 31, 2015. Revenues and gross box-office derived from outside the United States and Canada continue to exceed revenues and gross box-office from the United States and Canada. 
 Greater China continues to be the Companys second-largest and fastest-growing market, measured by revenues. In recent years, the Companys Greater China operations have accounted for an increasingly significant portion of its overall revenues, with approximately 31% of overall revenues generated from the Companys China operations in 2016. As at December 31, 2016, the Company had 424 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 334 theaters in backlog that are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2022. The Companys backlog in Greater China represents 67.1% of the Companys current backlog. The Company continues to invest in joint revenue sharing arrangements with select partners to ensure ongoing revenue in this key market. The Companys largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Cinema Line Corporation (Wanda). In 2016, the Company and Wanda signed an agreement for an additional 150 theater systems under a joint revenue sharing arrangement. This increases Wandas total commitment to the Company to 360 theater systems, of which 345 theater systems are under the parties joint revenue sharing arrangement. Furthermore, the Company has partnerships with CJ CGV Holdings, Ltd., for a commitment of 120 theater systems (of which 100 theater systems will be located in China), and with Guangzhou JinYi Media Corporation for a commitment of 60 theater systems (all of which are located in China). 
 In 2014, the Company completed the sale and issuance of 20% of the shares of the Companys subsidiary, IMAX China Holding, Inc. (IMAX China), to entities owned and controlled by CMC Capital Partners (CMC), an investment fund that is focused on media and entertainment, and FountainVest Partners (FountainVest), a China-focused private equity firm. The sale price for the interest was $80.0 million (collectively, the IMAX China Investment). On October 8, 2015, IMAX China completed an initial public offering of its ordinary shares on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited (the IMAX China IPO). Following the IMAX China IPO, the Company continues to indirectly own approximately 68.2% of IMAX China, which remains a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 The Company believes that there have been a number of financial, strategic and operating benefits resulting from both the IMAX China Investment and the IMAX China IPO. With respect to the IMAX China Investment, the Company believes that the investors knowledge of, and influence in, the Chinese media and entertainment industry has contributed to the continued expansion of IMAXs theater network in China and the further strengthening of the Companys government and industry relationships. In addition, the Company believes that the IMAX China IPO provides investors the ability to directly access and evaluate the IMAX China business, and provides greater clarity into the businesss performance in the fastest-growing entertainment market in the world. 
 Over the years, several technological breakthroughs have established IMAX as an important distribution platform for Hollywoods biggest event films. These include: 
 

 | DMR  IMAXs proprietary DMR technology digitally converts live-action digital films or 35mm to its large-format, while meeting the Companys high standards of image and sound quality. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage, which in recent years has averaged approximately 12.5%, of box-office receipts, net of sales tax, of any commercial films released in the IMAX theater network outside of Greater China from the applicable film studio for the conversion of the film to the IMAX DMR format and for access to the Companys premium distribution platform. Within Greater China, the Company receives a lower percentage of box-office receipts for certain films. At December 31, 2016, the Company had released 294 IMAX DMR films since the introduction of IMAX DMR in 2002. The number of films released on an annual basis that have been converted through the DMR process has increased significantly in recent years with the advent of digital technology that has reduced the DMR conversion time and with the strengthening of the Companys relationships with major Hollywood studios, as well as international studios. Accordingly, 51 films converted through the IMAX DMR process were released in 2016, as compared to six in 2007.

 | IMAX Xenon-Based Digital Projection System  The Company introduced its xenon-based digital projection system in 2008. Prior to 2008, all of IMAXs large format projectors were film-based and required analog film prints. The IMAX xenon-based digital projection system, which operates without the need for such film prints, was designed specifically for use by commercial multiplex operators and allows operators to reduce the capital and operating costs required to run an IMAX theater without sacrificing the image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience. By making The IMAX Experience more accessible for commercial multiplex operators, the introduction of the IMAX xenon-based digital projection system paved the way for a number of important joint revenue sharing arrangements which have allowed the Company to rapidly expand its theater network. Since announcing that the Company was developing xenon-based digital projection technology, the vast majority of the Companys theater system signings have been for xenon-based digital systems. As at December 31, 2016, the Company has signed agreements for 1,571 xenon-based digital systems since 2007, 303 of which were signed in 2016 alone. As at December 31, 2016, 1,093 IMAX xenon-based digital projection systems were in operation, an increase of 16.4% over the 939 xenon-based digital projection systems in operation as at December 31, 2015 and 478 IMAX xenon-based digital projection systems were in backlog as compared to 348 xenon-based digital systems in backlog as at December 31, 2015.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | IMAX Laser-Based Digital Projection System  As one of the worlds leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. To that end, the Company introduced its next-generation laser-based digital projection system at the end of 2014, which was co-developed with Barco N.V. and incorporates exclusive technology developed or otherwise obtained by the Company. The Company believes that the IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, and consume less power and last longer than existing digital technology. The laser projection solution is the first IMAX digital projection system capable of illuminating the largest screens in its network. As of December 31, 2016, 39 laser-based digital theater systems were operational. The Company is in the process of developing a commercial laser-based digital projection system designed for IMAX theaters in multiplexes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the design and manufacture of premium theater systems, the Company is also engaged in the production and distribution of original large-format films, the provision of services in support of the IMAX theater network, the provision of post-production services for large-format films, the operation of three IMAX theaters and, from time-to-time the conversion of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Hollywood feature films for exhibition on IMAX theater systems around the world. 
 NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES 
 The Company is exploring new lines of business, with a focus on location-based experiences, alternative forms of in-cinema entertainment and in-home entertainment. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company announced its comprehensive virtual reality (VR) strategy to develop a premium, location-based VR offering that will deliver immersive, multi-dimensional experiences, including entertainment content and games, to branded VR centers (IMAX VR Centers). IMAX VR Centers are expected to be located in both stand-alone venues as well as multiplexes, malls and other commercial destinations, and will be retrofitted with proprietary VR pods that permit interactive, moveable VR experiences. The Companys VR initiative is premised on a unique combination of premium content, proprietary design and best-in-class technology. 
 In order to deliver high quality content to the IMAX VR Centers, the Company has partnered with Google to design and develop a cinema-grade IMAX VR camera, which will enable filmmakers and content creators to capture and deliver high-quality, 360-degree content experiences to audiences. In addition, the Company recently announced the creation of an approximately $50.0 million virtual reality fund (the VR Fund) among the Company, its subsidiary IMAX China and other strategic investors. The VR Fund will help finance the creation of an estimated 25-30 interactive VR content experiences over the next three years for use across all VR platforms, including in the IMAX VR Centers. The VR Fund will target premium productions with its Hollywood studio and filmmaker partners, as well as gaming publishers and other leading content developers. 
 In January 2017, the Company launched its flagship pilot IMAX VR Center in Los Angeles and has signed agreements for additional IMAX VR center pilots in China, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which are scheduled to open in the coming months. The Company plans to use these pilot locations to test several factors including the overall customer experience, pricing models, throughput, types of content featured and differences in geographic areas. If successful, the Companys intent is to roll out IMAX VR Centers globally. 
 Through its VR initiative, the Company sees a unique opportunity to combine premium equipment, more robust computing power, and specially designed spaces to create a highly differentiated, destination-based VR experience that will draw consumers out of their homes, similar to the strategy it has successfully employed in the cinema space.

The Company is also focusing on alternative forms of in-cinema entertainment, including original content. In November 2016, the Company announced an agreement with Marvel Television Inc. (Marvel) and Disney|ABC Television Group to co-produce and exclusively premiere the new ABC series Marvels Inhumans in IMAX theaters. Under the agreement, the first two episodes of the series are expected to run worldwide exclusively in IMAX theaters for two weeks in September 2017. Several weeks later, the series will premiere on the ABC network in the U.S. and across other networks internationally. As a result of the Companys significant financing commitment, the Company will have an equity participation both in the pilot and in the television series. This agreement marks the first time a live-action television series has debuted in this manner, and the first time the Company has an economic interest in a television property. 
 In 2015, the Company announced the creation of the IMAX China Film Fund (the China Film Fund) with its subsidiary IMAX China, its partner CMC and several other larger investors to help fund Mandarin language commercial films. The China Film Fund, which is expected initially to be capitalized with over $100.0 million, will target productions that can leverage the Companys brand, relationships, technology and release windows in China. The China Film Fund is expected to co-finance approximately 15 Mandarin-language tent-pole films over three years, and will target contributions of between $3.0 million and $7.0 million per film. The China Film Fund will operate under an IMAX China-CMC controlled greenlight committee. 
 Also, in 2014, the Company announced the creation of the IMAX Original Film Fund (the Film Fund) to co-finance a portfolio of 10 original large format films. The Film Fund, which is intended to be capitalized with up to $50.0 million, will finance an ongoing supply of original films that the Company believes will be more exciting and compelling than traditional documentaries. The initial investment in the Film Fund was committed to by a third party in the amount of $25.0 million, with the possibility of contributing additional funds. The Company agreed to contribute $9.0 million to the Film Fund over five years starting in 2014 and sees the Film Fund as a self-perpetuating vehicle designed to generate a continuous flow of high-quality documentary content. As at December 31, 2016, the Film Fund has invested $13.4 million toward the development of original films. 
 The Company has also made inroads in the realm of in-home entertainment. To that end, the Company has announced home theater initiatives, including a joint venture with TCL Multimedia Technology Holding Limited (TCL) to design, develop, manufacture and sell a premium home theater system. Since 2013, the joint venture has signed agreements with end users for the sale of more than 140 premium home theater systems, and has signed agreements with distributors for the sale of more than 500 home theater systems. Beyond its premium home theater, the Company is also currently developing other components of broader home entertainment platform designed to allow consumers to experience elements of The IMAX Experience® in their homes. 
 PRODUCT LINES 
 The Company believes it is the worlds largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, as well as a significant producer and distributor of large-format films. The Companys theater systems include specialized IMAX projectors, advanced sound systems and specialty screens. The Company derives its revenues from: 

 | IMAX theater systems (design, manufacture, sale or lease of, and provision of services related to, its theater systems);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Films (production and digital re-mastering of films, the distribution of film products to the IMAX theater network, post-production and print services for films);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Joint revenue sharing arrangements (the provision of its theater system to an exhibitor in exchange for a certain percentage of theater revenue and, in some cases, a small upfront or initial payment);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Theater system maintenance (the use of maintenance services related to its theater systems); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other activities, which include theater operations (owning equipment, operating, managing or participating in the revenues of IMAX theaters), the sale of after-market parts and camera rentals.

 Segmented information is provided in note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 IMAX Theater Systems, Theater System Maintenance and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements 
 The Companys primary products are its theater systems. The Companys digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAXs digital projection system also operates without the need for analog film prints. Traditional IMAX film-based theater systems contain the same components as the digital projection systems but include a rolling loop 15/70-format projector and require the use of analog film prints. Since its introduction in 2008, the vast majority of the Companys theater sales have been digital systems. Furthermore, a majority of the 
 
7 
 
 Companys existing film-based theater systems have been upgraded, at a cost to the exhibitor, to an IMAX digital system. As part of the arrangement to sell or lease its theater systems, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design and supervision of installation services. Theater systems are also leased or sold with a license for the use of the world-famous IMAX brand. 
 The Companys digital projection system provides a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing for the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. The relatively low cost of a digital file delivery (approximately $100 per movie per system compared to $30 thousand per 2D print and $60 thousand per 3D print for an IMAX analog film print) ensures programming flexibility, which in turn allows theaters to program significantly more IMAX DMR films per year. More programming increases customer choice and potentially increases total box-office revenue. In 2016, 51 films converted through the IMAX DMR process were released to the IMAX theater network as compared to six films in 2007. To date, the Company has contracted for the release of 26 DMR titles to its theater network for 2017; however, the Company expects a similar number of films to be released to the network in 2017 as experienced in 2016. The Company remains in active discussions with all the major studios regarding future titles for 2017 and beyond. Furthermore, the Company expects to announce both additional local language IMAX DMR films and original and alternative content to be released to the IMAX theater network in 2017 and beyond. Supplementing the Companys film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local DMR titles is an important component of the Companys international film strategy. 
 To complement its viewing experience, the Company provides digital sound system components which are specifically designed for IMAX theaters. These components are among the most advanced in the industry and help to heighten the realistic feeling of an IMAX presentation, thereby providing IMAX theater systems with an important competitive edge over other theater systems. The Company believes it is a world leader in the design and manufacture of digital sound system components for applications including traditional movie theaters, auditoriums and IMAX theaters. 
 The film-based GT and SR systems and the IMAX digital systems are flat screens that have a minimum of curvature and tilt and can exhibit both 2D and 3D films, while the screen components in dome shaped theaters are 2D only and are popular with the Companys institutional clients. All IMAX theaters, with the exception of dome configurations, feature a steeply inclined floor to provide each audience member with a clear view of the screen. The Company holds patents on the geometrical design of IMAX theaters. 
 The Companys arrangements for theater system equipment involve a sale, sales-type lease or joint revenue sharing arrangement. As part of the purchase, lease or other acquisition of an IMAX theater system, the Company also advises the customer on theater design, supervises the installation of the theater systems and provides projectionists with training in using the equipment. The supervision of installation requires that the equipment also be put through a complete functional start-up and test procedure to ensure proper operation. Theater owners or operators are responsible for providing the theater location, the design and construction of the theater building, the installation of the system components and any other necessary improvements, as well as the theaters marketing and programming. The Companys typical arrangement also includes trademark license rights whose term tracks the term of the underlying agreement. The theater system equipment components (including the projector, sound system, screen system, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning machine), theater design support, supervision of installation, projectionist training and trademark rights are all elements of what the Company considers the system deliverable (the System Deliverable). For a separate fee, the Company provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services for the theater system. The Companys contracts are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, except in Canada, China, Japan and parts of Europe, where contracts are sometimes denominated in local currency. 
 Sales-type leases typically have an initial 10-year term and are typically renewable by the customer for one or more additional 5 to 10-year terms. Under the terms of the typical lease agreement, the title to the theater system equipment (including the projector, the sound system and the projection screen) remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are generally not cancelable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. 
 Under a sales agreement, by contrast, the title to the theater system equipment components passes to the customer. In certain instances, however, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required under the agreement. 
 The typical sales-type lease or sales arrangement provides for three major sources of cash flows for the Company: (i) initial fees; (ii) ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees; and (iii) ongoing maintenance and extended warranty fees. Initial fees generally are received over the period of time from the date the arrangement is executed to the date the equipment is installed and customer 
 
8 
 
 acceptance has been received. However, in certain cases, the payments of the initial fee may be scheduled over a period of time after the equipment is installed and customer acceptance has been received. Ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees and ongoing maintenance and extended warranty fees are generally received over the life of the arrangement and are usually adjusted annually based on changes in the local consumer price index. The ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees generally provide for a fee which is the greater of a fixed amount or a certain percentage of the theater box-office. The terms of each arrangement vary according to the configuration of the theater system provided, the cinema market and the film distribution market relevant to the geographic location of the customer. 
 The Company also offers certain commercial clients IMAX theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. The Company has two basic types of joint revenue sharing arrangements: traditional and hybrid. Under a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the Company provides the IMAX theater system in return for a portion of the customers IMAX box-office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront payment or annual minimum payments. Payments, which are based on box-office receipts, are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or quarterly. Certain maintenance and extended warranty services are provided to the customer for a separate fixed annual fee. The Company retains title to the theater system equipment components, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. 
 Under a hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangement, by contrast, the customer is responsible for making upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX theater system in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a straight sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a portion of the customers IMAX box-office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although the percentage of box-office receipts owing to the Company is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. The Company generally retains title to the theater system equipment components, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. In limited instances, however, title to the theater system equipment components passes to the customer. 
 Under the significant majority of joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term of IMAX theater systems is 10 years or longer, and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In rare cases, the contract provides certain performance thresholds that, if not met by either party, allow the other party to terminate the agreement. By offering arrangements in which exhibitors do not need to invest the significant initial capital required of a sales-type lease or a sale arrangement, the Company has been able to expand its theater network at a significantly faster pace than it had previously. As at December 31, 2016, the Company has entered into joint revenue sharing arrangements for 995 systems with 48 partners, 640 of which were in operation as at December 31, 2016. 
 In 2012, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (Dalian Wanda), the parent company of Wanda, acquired AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC). Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together is the Companys largest customer, representing approximately 13.5%, 16.0% and 14.5% of the Companys total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, Wanda and AMC together represented approximately 40.3% of the commercial network and 39.8% of the Companys backlog as of December 31, 2016. See Risk Factors  Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together account for a significant and growing portion of the Companys revenue and backlog. A deterioration in the Companys relationship with Wanda and/or AMC could materially, adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. in Item 1A.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Includes 24 laser-based digital theater system configurations, including 13 upgrades.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The number of theater systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new theater system arrangements signed from year to year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of theater systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Sales backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated theater. Sales backlog includes initial fees along with the estimated present value of contractual ongoing fees due over the term, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues as well as fees in excess of contractual ongoing fees that may be received in the future. The value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, letters of intent or long-term conditional theater commitments. The value of theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements is excluded from the dollar value of sales backlog, although certain theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for theater system installations that are listed in sales backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 The following chart shows the number of the Companys theater systems by configuration, opened theater network base and backlog as at December 31:

 The Company estimates that it will install approximately 150 -155 new theater systems (excluding upgrades) in 2017. The Companys installation estimates includes scheduled systems from backlog, as well as the Companys estimate of installations from arrangements that will sign and install in the same calendar year. The Company cautions, however, that theater system installations may slip from period to period over the course of the Companys business, usually for reasons beyond its control. 
 IMAX theater systems consist of the following configurations: 
 IMAX Digital: Xenon Theater Systems. In July 2008, the Company introduced a proprietary IMAX xenon-based digital projection system that it believes delivers higher quality imagery compared with other digital systems and that is consistent with the Companys brand. As at December 31, 2016, the Company had installed 1,093 xenon-based digital theater systems and has an additional 478 xenon-based digital theater systems in its backlog. 
 IMAX Digital: Laser Theater Systems. The Company introduced its next-generation laser-based digital projection system at the end of 2014. The Company believes the IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, and consume less power and last longer than existing digital technology, capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX theater network. As at December 31, 2016, the Company had installed 39 laser-based digital systems. The Company is in the process of developing a commercial laser-based digital projection system designed for IMAX theaters in multiplexes. 
 IMAX Flat Screen and IMAX Dome Theater Systems. IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome systems primarily have been installed in institutions such as museums and science centers. Flat screen IMAX theaters were introduced in 1970, while IMAX dome theaters, which are designed for tilted dome screens, were introduced in 1973. There have been several significant proprietary and patented enhancements to these systems since their introduction. As at December 31, 2016, there were 56 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the IMAX network, as compared to 67 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems as at December 31, 2015. With the introduction of the IMAX digital theater systems, there has been a decrease in the number of IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the network. 
 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems. IMAX 3D theaters utilize a flat screen 3D system, which produces realistic 3D images on an IMAX screen. As at December 31, 2016, there were 27 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation compared to 37 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation as at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the number of 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems is largely attributable to the conversion of existing 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems to IMAX digital theater systems. 
 Films 
 Film Production and Digital Re-mastering (IMAX DMR) 
 In 2002, the Company developed a proprietary technology to digitally re-master Hollywood films into IMAX digital cinema package format or 15/70-format film for exhibition in IMAX theaters at a modest cost that is incurred by the Company. This system, known as IMAX DMR, digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. This technology has enabled the IMAX theater network to release Hollywood films simultaneously with their broader domestic release. The development of this technology was critical in helping the Company execute its strategy of expanding its commercial theater network by establishing IMAX theaters as a key, premium distribution platform for Hollywood films. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage, which in recent years has averaged approximately 12.5%, of box-office receipts, net of sales tax, of any commercial films released in the IMAX theater network outside of Greater China from the applicable film studio for the conversion of the film to the IMAX DMR format and for access to the Companys premium distribution platform. Within Greater China, the Company receives a lower percentage of box-office receipts for certain films. 
 Other factors beyond the IMAX DMR format, and IMAXs proprietary projection and sound technology, further differentiate IMAX content from other film content. Filmmakers choose IMAX cameras to shoot selected scenes to increase the audiences immersion in the film and take advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by shooting the film in a larger aspect ratio. Certain films also enjoy early release windows in IMAX, including Everest: An IMAX 3D Experience and The Walk: The IMAX 
 
11 
 
 Experience, which were released one week early in IMAX theaters in 2015. Several recent films have featured select sequences shot with IMAX cameras including Captain America: Civil War: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in May 2016; Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in March 2016; Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in December 2015; Interstellar: The IMAX Experience, released in November 2014; and Transformers Age of Extinction: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in June 2014 among others. In addition, Marvels Avengers: Infinity War  Part 1: An IMAX 3D Experience and Avengers: Infinity War  Part 2: An IMAX 3D Experience are expected to be shot in their entireties using the IMAX camera, which is the second time a full feature length movie will be filmed with the IMAX cameras. Sully: The IMAX Experience, released in August 2016, was shot with IMAX cameras for a majority of the film. IMAX theaters therefore serve as an additional distribution platform for Hollywood films, just as home video and pay-per-view are ancillary distribution platforms. In some cases, the Company may also have certain distribution rights to the films produced using its IMAX DMR technology. 
 The IMAX DMR process involves the following: 
 

 | in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | recording the enhanced digital image onto IMAX 15/70-format film or IMAX digital cinema package (DCP) format; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | specially re-mastering the sound track to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX theater systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The first IMAX DMR film, Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, produced in conjunction with Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, was released in September 2002 to 48 IMAX theaters. One of the more recent IMAX DMR films, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: An IMAX 3D Experience was released in November 2016 to 1,108 IMAX theaters. Since the release of Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, to December 31, 2016, an additional 293 IMAX DMR films have been released to the IMAX theater network. 
 Advances in the IMAX DMR process allow the re-mastering process to meet aggressive film production schedules. The Company has decreased the length of time it takes to reformat a film with its IMAX DMR technology. Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, released in September 2002, was re-mastered in 16 weeks, while certain current films can be re-mastered in less than one week. The IMAX DMR conversion of simultaneous, or day-and-date releases are done in parallel with the movies filming and editing, which is necessary for the simultaneous release of an IMAX DMR film with the domestic release to conventional theaters. 
 The original soundtrack of a film to be released to the IMAX network is re-mastered for the IMAX six or twelve-channel digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX re-mastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in a good listening position. 
 The Company believes that the growth in international box-office will continue to be an important driver of future growth for the Company. In fact, during the year ended December 31, 2016, 61.8% of the Companys gross box-office from IMAX DMR films was generated in international markets. To support growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing the Companys film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local IMAX DMR releases in select markets. In 2016, the Company released 12 local language IMAX DMR films, including nine in China, two in Russia and one in Japan, and in 2015, the Company released 11 local language IMAX DMR films, including eight in China and three in Japan. 
 In 2016, 51 films were converted through the IMAX DMR process and released to theaters in the IMAX network by film studios as compared to 44 films in 2015.

 In addition, in conjunction with Marvel and Disney|ABC Television Group, the Company will be co-producing and exclusively premiering the new ABC series Marvels Inhumans in IMAX theaters. The first two episodes of the series are expected to run worldwide exclusively in IMAX theaters for two weeks in September 2017, and several weeks later, the series will premiere on the ABC network. The Company will have an equity participation both in the pilot and in the television series, representing the first time the Company will have an economic interest in a television property. 
 The Company remains in active negotiations with all of the major Hollywood studios, as well as international studios, for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate, and anticipates that a similar number of IMAX DMR films will be released to the IMAX theater network in 2017 to the films that were released to the IMAX theater network in 2016. 
 The Company also expects to announce both additional local language IMAX DMR films and original and alternative content to be released to the IMAX theater network in 2017 and beyond. Supplementing the Companys film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local DMR titles is an important component of the Companys international film strategy. 
 Film Distribution 
 The Company is also a distributor of large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company generally distributes films which it produces or for which it has acquired distribution rights from independent producers. The Company receives either a percentage of the theater box-office receipts or a fixed amount as a distribution fee. 
 Films produced by the Company are typically financed through third parties, whereby the Company will generally receive a film production fee in exchange for producing the film and a distribution fee for distributing the film. The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As at December 31, 2016, the Company currently has distribution rights with respect to 46 of such films, which cover such subjects such as space, wildlife, music, history and natural wonders. Several more recent large-format films that have been distributed by the Company include: A Beautiful Planet, which was 
 
13 
 
 released in April 2016 and has grossed over $10.1 million as at the end of 2016; Voyage of Time, which was released in October 2016 and has grossed over $0.3 million as at the end of 2016; Island of Lemurs: Madagascar, which was released in April 2014 and has grossed over $13.2 million as at the end of 2016; Journey to the South Pacific, which had a limited release in November 2013 and a broader release in 2014 and has grossed $12.6 million as at the end of 2016. Large-format films have significantly longer exhibition periods than conventional commercial films and many of the films in the large-format library have remained popular for many decades, including the films SPACE STATION, Hubble 3D and T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous. 
 Film Post-Production 
 The Company also provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced internally or externally), and digital post-production services. 
 Other 
 Theater Operations 
 As at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had two and three owned and operated theaters on leased premises, respectively. In addition, the Company has a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses. The Company also provides management services to two theaters. 
Cameras 
 The Company rents its 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third party production companies. The Company also provides production technical support and post-production services for a fee. All IMAX 2D and 3D film cameras run 65mm negative film, exposing 15 perforations per frame and resulting in an image area nearly 10x larger than standard 35mm film. The Company believes that its film-based 3D camera, which is a patented, state-of-the-art dual and single filmstrip 3D camera, is among the most advanced motion picture cameras in the world and is the only 3D camera of its kind. The IMAX 3D camera simultaneously shoots left-eye and right-eye images and enables filmmakers to access a variety of locations, such as underwater or aboard aircraft. The Company has also developed a high speed 3D digital camera which utilizes a pair of the worlds largest digital sensors. 
 The Company maintains cameras and other film equipment and also offers production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers. 
 MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 
 The Company markets its theater systems through a direct sales force and marketing staff located in offices in Canada, the United States, Greater China, Europe and Asia. In addition, the Company has agreements with consultants, business brokers and real estate professionals to locate potential customers and theater sites for the Company on a commission basis. 
 The commercial multiplex theater segment of the Companys theater network is now its largest segment, comprising 1,107 IMAX theaters, or 91.1%, of the 1,215 IMAX theaters open as at December 31, 2016. The Companys institutional customers include science and natural history museums, zoos, aquaria and other educational and cultural centers. Over the last several years the Company has not been able to digitally upgrade many of the institutional locations due to the size of the screens. The development of the IMAX digital laser-based system, which was rolled out at the end of 2014, together with the completion of the Film Fund should assist in supporting this segment of the Companys customer base. The Company also sells or leases its theater systems to theme parks, private home theaters, tourist destination sites, fairs and expositions (the Commercial Destination segment). At December 31, 2016, approximately 63.7% of all opened IMAX theaters were in locations outside of the United States and Canada.

 For information on revenue breakdown by geographic area, see note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The Companys foreign operations are subject to certain risks. See Risk Factors  The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations sales and future growth prospects and Risk Factors  The Company faces risks in connection with the continued expansion of its business in China in Item 1A. The Companys two largest customers as at December 31, 2016, collectively represent 40.3% of the Companys network base of theaters, 39.8% of the Companys theater system backlog and 17.0% of revenues. 
 INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION 
 Within the past decade, as the motion picture industry has transitioned from film projection to digital projection, a number of companies have introduced digital 3D projection technology and an increasing number of Hollywood features have been exhibited using these technologies. As part of this digital transition, a number of commercial exhibitors have introduced their own large screen branded theaters, while certain projection manufacturers and entertainment technology companies have also announced their own proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors. The Company believes that all of these alternative film formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience. In 2008, the Company introduced its proprietary digitally-based projector which is capable of 2D and 3D presentations on large screens and which comprises the majority of its current theater system sales. The Company is in the process of developing a commercial laser-based digital projection system designed for IMAX theaters in multiplexes. 
 The Company may also face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, DVD, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television. The Company further competes for the publics leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. 
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX theater systems, the return on investment of an IMAX theater, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers, a number of whom desire to film portions of their movies with IMAX cameras, the quality of the sound system components included with the IMAX theater, the availability of Hollywood and international event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, consumer loyalty and the level of the Companys service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its next-generation laser-based projection system increases further the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. As a result, the Company believes that all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters.

THE IMAX BRAND 
 IMAX is a world leader in entertainment technology. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers and studios use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what todays movie audiences crave  a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. Consumer research conducted in six countries worldwide by a leading third-party research firm shows that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience and is by far the most differentiated movie-going brand. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other exhibition and entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. IMAX brand strength is evidenced by growing market share, high average ticket prices and per screen averages that outperform the industry. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company believes that it is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. In recent years, the Company has increased its level of research and development in order to develop its next-generation laser-based projection system. The laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. Currently, the Company experiences lower than expected margins from the installation of these laser-based projection systems. As a result, in 2016, the Company focused its research and development efforts on a new commercial laser-based projection system in order to create a more cost-effective solution. The Company intends for additional research and development to continue in 2017 to support the further development of the laser-based digital projection system. In 2016, the Company also began research and development in connection with its exploration of a comprehensive VR strategy to deliver immersive and interactive experiences to consumers through pilot IMAX VR Centers. In addition, the Company plans to continue research and development activity in the future in other areas considered important to the Companys continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors; enhancing the Companys 2D and 3D image quality; expanding the applicability of the Companys digital technology, and using such technology to help expand the Companys home entertainment platform; developing IMAX theater systems capabilities in both home and live entertainment; and improving the Companys proprietary tuning system and mastering processes. 
 The Company has also made significant investments in other areas of digital technologies, including the development of a proprietary technology to digitally enhance image resolution and quality of motion picture films including High Dynamic Range content, the creation of an IMAX digital projector and the licensing of prominent laser illumination technology. Accordingly, the Company holds a number of patents, patents pending and other intellectual property rights in these areas. In addition, the Company holds numerous digital patents and relationships with key manufacturers and suppliers in digital technology. 
 In 2009, the Company developed its first 3D digital camera primarily for use in IMAX documentary productions. Portions of Born to Be Wild 3D and Island of Lemurs: Madagascar were filmed with the IMAX 3D digital camera and the camera has subsequently been used to film footage for Transformers: Age of Extinction: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in June 2014 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in December 2015. Several recent films have featured select sequences shot with IMAX cameras including Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in March 2016; Captain America: Civil War: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in May 2016; and Transformers Age of Extinction: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in June 2014. In addition, Marvels Avengers: Infinity War  Part 1: An IMAX 3D Experience and Avengers: Infinity War  Part 2: An IMAX 3D Experience are expected to be shot in their entireties using the IMAX camera, which is the second time a full feature length movie will be filmed with the IMAX cameras. Due to the increasing success major Hollywood filmmakers have experienced with IMAX cameras, the Company has identified the development and manufacture of additional IMAX cameras as an important research and development initiative. 
 The Company also has made progress deploying its proprietary expertise in image technology and 3D technology, as well as its proprietary film content and the IMAX brand, for applications in its in-home entertainment technology initiatives, including its premium home theater system with TCL. The premium home theater system incorporates 4K projection technology, together with security and delivery technology to enable the viewing of current theatrical releases that have been digitally re-mastered with IMAX enhancement technology. To date, the Companys joint venture with TCL has signed agreements with end users for the sale of more than 140 theater systems, and has signed agreements with distributors for the sale of more than 500 home theater systems.

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded research and development expenses of $16.3 million, $12.7 million and $16.1 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2016, 88 of the Companys employees were connected with research and development projects. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing 
 The Company assembles the projector of its theater systems at its office in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). The Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. Fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. In 2016, these projectors, including both the Companys xenon and laser-based projection systems, had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99.9%. 
Sound System Component Manufacturing 
 The Company develops, designs and assembles the key elements of its theater sound system component. The standard IMAX theater sound system component comprises parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50% of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system component to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. 
 Screen and Other Components 
 The Company purchases its screen component and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component is comprised of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theaters water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses. 
Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services 
 The Company also provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX theater systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company often includes free service in the initial year of an arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for theater systems. 
 To support the IMAX theater network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing theater systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the theater system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customers technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customers maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both xenon and laser-based digital systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.
