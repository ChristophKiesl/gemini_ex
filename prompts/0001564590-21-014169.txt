 Overview 
 We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company focused on helping patients fight cancer by developing therapies that focus on the CD47-SIRPα checkpoint pathway and bridge the innate and adaptive immune system. Cancer cells leverage CD47, a cell surface protein, as a “don’t eat me” signal, to evade detection by the immune system. Our lead program is a next-generation checkpoint inhibitor designed to have a high affinity for CD47 and to avoid the limitations caused by hematologic toxicities inherent in other CD47 blocking approaches. We believe our lead product candidate, ALX148, will have a wide therapeutic window to block the “don’t eat me” signal on cancer cells, and to leverage the immune activation of broadly used anti-cancer agents through combination strategies. We have dosed over 170 subjects with ALX148 across a range of hematologic and solid malignancies in combination with a number of leading anti-cancer agents. We intend to continue clinical development for the treatment of a range of solid tumor indications and for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We plan to initiate additional studies in combination with leading anti-cancer agents. In solid tumors, we intend to initiate randomized Phase 2 trials of ALX148 for the treatment of first-line head and neck cancer and second-line gastric/gastroesophageal junction, or GEJ, cancer and a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of breast cancer in 2021. In hematologic malignancies, we have dosed the first subjects for the treatment of MDS and intend to advance ALX148 into clinical development for the treatment of AML in the second half of 2021. Based on our clinical results to date in multiple oncology indications showing encouraging anti-tumor activity and tolerability and our clinical development plans, our strategy is to pursue ALX148 as a potentially critical component for future combination treatments in oncology. Our second program combines our company’s SIRPα antibodies with Tallac Therapeutics’ toll-like receptor 9 agonist antibody conjugate to deliver a potent immune activator to myeloid cells in the tumor to promote innate and adaptive anti-cancer immune responses. 
 Anti-cancer agents, including many chemotherapies, other small molecules and anti-cancer antibodies, can stimulate immune cells such as macrophages to engulf and kill cancer cells, a process known as phagocytosis, by providing so-called “eat me” signals on cancer cells. In response, cancer cells frequently overexpress CD47 to counteract these “eat me” signals. As a result, high expression of CD47 on cancer cells has been associated with reduced patient survival in multiple cancers. The therapeutic blockade of CD47 in combination with an “eat me” signal enables the immune system to detect and phagocytose cancer cells. However, healthy blood cells and nearly all other cells in the body also express CD47 as a way to protect against pathologic phagocytosis by immune cells. There have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region. These approaches have encountered limitations, including limited dosing and therapeutic window, limited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents, limited efficacy in solid tumors and limited indications due to patient selection, that have challenged their ability to maximize the full potential of CD47 blockade. In addition, most of these therapeutic approaches to CD47 blockade have resulted in the destruction of patients’ healthy blood cells, causing cytopenias that limit the dosing and therapeutic potential of those molecules. 
 ALX Oncology was founded by Corey Goodman, Ph.D., K. Christopher Garcia, Ph.D., and Jaume Pons, Ph.D. to address fundamental challenges in blocking CD47 and to realize the full potential of this therapeutic target. We have developed a new approach to CD47 blockade that is designed to maximize clinical activity and minimize toxicities. All competing clinical data to date have come from product candidates that incorporate an active antibody Fc region in addition to a CD47 blocking region. The Fc region provides a positive, pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal to macrophages and other cells of the immune system. Since healthy blood cells also express CD47, these competing therapeutic approaches can cause a reduction in the number of blood cells in the body, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which can be dangerous to patients and may limit the ability to combine these agents with other anti-cancer medicines.

Our lead product candidate, ALX148, is a next-generation CD47 blocking therapeutic that we believe has significantly enhanced properties compared to competing CD47 blocking approaches. ALX148 is a fusion protein that combines a high-affinity CD47 binding domain with a proprietary inactivated Fc domain. The CD47 binding domain of ALX148 is an affinity enhanced extracellular domain of SIRPα, a protein that is the natural receptor to CD47 found on myeloid cells. We have engineered the Fc domain of ALX148 so that it does not provide a pro-phagocytic signal while still maintaining an antibody-like half-life for the molecule. We believe our inactive Fc approach improves tolerability when compared to other CD47 blocking approaches that have an Fc domain that engages activating receptors on macrophages, causing phagocytosis and death of healthy cells in addition to cancer cells. 
 ALX148’s design has several advantages that we believe will make it broadly applicable to treating a number of oncology indications. Due to the inactive Fc, ALX148 is specifically designed for use in combination with other anti-cancer agents that provide a positive immune-stimulating signal. We believe ALX148 has a favorable tolerability profile that may enable higher dosing levels and greater combination potential with other leading anti-cancer agents. Additionally, the molecular weight of ALX148 is half that of a typical antibody. The relatively smaller size of our molecule may facilitate increased penetrance into the tumor microenvironment. We believe these properties may enable ALX148 to provide superior therapeutic benefits. 
 Clinical data to date in ALX148 have not shown dose-dependent hematologic toxicities, which are characteristic of other CD47 blockers that incorporate an active Fc domain. At least 170 subjects have been treated with ALX148 in combination with targeted anti-cancer agents, small molecules, and checkpoint inhibitors as of December 31, 2020. ALX148 has not reached a maximum tolerated dose in any of the combinations evaluated to date. 
 In October 2020, we began enrollment in subjects with MDS and plan to advance ALX148 for the treatment of AML. In our Phase 1b trial of ALX148 in combination with an anti-CD20 agent to treat subjects with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, ALX148 demonstrated a higher response rate at higher doses and achieved a 70.0% objective response rate, or ORR, in the highest dose (15 mg/kg once per week, or QW) cohort as compared to a 40.9% ORR at the lower dose (10 mg/kg QW) cohort. We view this ORR as compelling evidence for the role of ALX148 in treating hematologic malignancies and as a favorable comparison to outcomes reported by other CD47 blocking agents in a similar patient population. Furthermore, other CD47 blocking agents in development have demonstrated clinical evidence supporting the role of CD47 blockade in treating hematologic malignances, specifically in both MDS and AML, albeit with high rates of cytopenias. We have conducted preclinical studies of ALX148 combined with azacitidine or venetoclax that support our clinical development plan in MDS and AML. Azacitidine is a standard of care agent for the treatment of MDS. Azacitidine and venetoclax are both standard of care regimen components for the treatment of AML in older patients and those who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy due to comorbidities. We have conducted preclinical studies that show that azacitidine and venetoclax increase both the display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin and the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 on AML cells, suggesting that a CD47 blocking agent could maximize the activity of venetoclax and azacitidine in these models. Additionally, we have shown that azacitidine and ALX148 in combination produce increased phagocytosis in vitro and anti-tumor activity in mouse models compared to azacitidine alone. 
 Furthermore, we have demonstrated that combination treatment of ALX148 with azacitidine or venetoclax leads to tumor elimination and prolonged survival in leukemia mouse models. In October 2020, the first subjects received ALX148 in a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of subjects with higher-risk MDS. We also plan to advance ALX148 into a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for the first-line treatment of subjects with AML in the second half of 2021. 
 ALX148 has also generated clinical data in solid tumors in various combinations, including with a leading tumor antigen targeting antibody, a leading checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy. We believe that ALX148 induces multiple responses that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. We are investigating ALX148 for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2-positive gastric/GEJ carcinoma, and HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors. In Phase 1b clinical trials, ALX148 has demonstrated both objective clinical response per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, criteria and tolerability in combination with other broadly used cancer agents. Based on these results, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted Fast Track designation for ALX148 for both the treatment of patients with HNSCC in the first-line setting and for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric 
 2


or GEJ carcinoma in the second-line setting. While other CD47 blockers have failed to achieve meaningful clinical activity in the treatment of solid tumors, we believe ALX148’s properties, including favorable tolerability and ability to escalate to higher doses, coupled with high affinity and small size for enhanced solid tumor penetration, may underlie the observed anti-tumor activity in solid tumors. We are planning to advance ALX148 into two randomized Phase 2 trials in patients with previously untreated advanced HNSCC in combination with pembrolizumab, marketed as Keytruda, the market leading anti-programmed cell death protein-1, or PD-1, checkpoint inhibitor, with or without chemotherapy in the first half of 2021. These trials will be conducted in collaboration with Merck. We are also planning to advance ALX148 into randomized Phase 2 trials in subjects with previously treated advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ carcinoma in combination with trastuzumab, marketed as Herceptin, the market-leading anti-HER2 antibody, with the second line standard of care, ramucirumab, marketed as Cyramza, plus paclitaxel in the second half of 2021. We have also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks to initiate a Phase 1 trial of ALX148 in combination with Zymeworks’ HER2-targeted bispecific antibody zanidatamab for the treatment of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer. 
 Our team of industry veterans plans to continue to advance a broad development plan for ALX148 that balances speed to market, scale of unmet need and existing clinical evidence for ALX148’s combination mechanisms. Members of our management team have brought multiple drugs to FDA approval. Our President, Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jaume Pons, Ph.D., was Chief Science Officer of Rinat (a subsidiary of Pfizer), invented fremanezumab (FDA approved in 2018), tanezumab (Biologics License Application, or BLA, filed in 2020) and additional antibodies in late-stage development at Pfizer and advanced nine more drugs into human trials. Our Chief Medical Officer, Sophia Randolph, M.D., Ph.D., was the global clinical franchise lead for Ibrance at Pfizer, where she oversaw the program from first-in-human trials to regulatory approval. Our Executive Chairman and founder, Corey Goodman, Ph.D., an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, has co-founded seven biopharmaceutical companies, including Exelixis and Labrys (acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2014), and led Pfizer’s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center. Our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Garcia, has over 20 years of experience guiding public and private life science companies and has raised over $2.0 billion in debt and equity offerings. We have funded ALX Oncology to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our convertible preferred stock and the issuance and sale of our common stock through an initial public offering in July 2020 and a follow-on public offering in December 2020. We own global rights to all of our product candidates. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to transform treatment options for patients with cancer by developing ALX148 as a foundational checkpoint immunotherapy. 
 Key elements of our strategy to support this goal include: 
  
▪ | Advance our lead product candidate, ALX148, through clinical development for MDS and AML. We have initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial of ALX148, in combination with azacitidine, for the treatment of patients with higher-risk MDS and plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for the first-line treatment of patients with AML in the second half of 2021. Given the limitations of current treatment options for patients with MDS, preclinical activity of ALX148 in combination with azacitidine, clinical data from competitor programs and the differentiated tolerability profile of ALX148, we intend to pursue a strategy in which we will leverage the data generated from this Phase 1b/2 trial to request from the FDA that ALX148 be a candidate for accelerated approval in the first-line treatment of higher risk MDS. Similarly, we believe ALX148 combination therapies could address the significant unmet need for more active tolerable regimens in the majority of patients with AML who are not fit for intensive induction chemotherapy. While we plan to seek accelerated approval by the FDA for the use of ALX148 in higher risk MDS, and potentially AML, and may do so opportunistically for other indications in the future, there is no assurance that this approach will be successful for these as well as other indications.

▪ | Expanding the therapeutic potential of CD47 blockade into solid tumors. We believe ALX148 can overcome the limitations of other CD47 blocking approaches in solid tumors. We have generated encouraging data in subjects with HNSCC treated with ALX148 in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor with and without chemotherapy as well as in subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer, who have progressed on prior HER2-targeted therapy, treated in combination with a HER2-targeted antibody with and without chemotherapy. The FDA has granted ALX148 Fast Track designation in first-line HNSCC and second-line HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. We intend to pursue a strategy in which we will leverage the data generated from our planned randomized Phase 2 trials of ALX148 and pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy to request from the FDA that ALX148 be a candidate for accelerated approval in the first-line treatment of HNSCC. We are also planning a randomized Phase 2 trial of ALX148, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in second-line HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer and plan to request from the FDA that ALX148 be a candidate for accelerated approval in the second-line treatment of gastric/GEJ cancer. We also plan to initiate an additional Phase 1 trial of ALX148 in patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors in combination with zanidatamab.

▪ | Continuing development of a pipeline of innovative therapeutics based on our protein engineering expertise and knowledge of the immune system and cancer biology. We specialize in designing and developing drug candidates that engage the immune system. We continue to develop a pipeline of immuno-oncology programs that represent complementary, but differentiated, approaches to engaging the innate and adaptive immune systems. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Continuing to develop strategic partnerships to broaden the potential impact of our current and future product candidates across patient populations. In order to advance treatment options for the most patients, we have in the past and may in the future partner with other companies with complementary resources that will maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. Such partnerships may allow us to pair ALX148 and any future product candidates with other novel agents owned fully or in part by strategic partners. Partnerships may and will also help realize the full potential of our product candidates in markets where we are unlikely to pursue development or commercialization on our own. We intend to maintain significant economic interest in our product candidates and selectively consider partnership opportunities. In September 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Merck on a Phase 2 trial evaluating ALX148 in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. In November 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks on a Phase 1 trial evaluating ALX148 with the HER2-targeting bispecific antibody zanidatamab in patients with advanced HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors.

Pipeline 
 Our initial programs are focused on targeting CD47 across various oncology indications. Many forms of cancer use CD47 expression as a means of evading immune response. We are targeting the hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications where we believe we have the greatest potential to address large markets and unmet medical needs.

The chart below summarizes the development status of our product candidate pipeline. 
 

We also have a preclinical program focused on developing a SIRPα TRAAC that may offer additional ways to engage the innate and adaptive immune response to cancer. 
 CD47 Scientific Background 
 Cancer immunotherapies targeting adaptive immune system checkpoints, notably those related to T cells, have transformed the standard of care in oncology across multiple cancer types. Initial clinical successes in this area have focused on stimulating the adaptive immune system. However, emerging evidence demonstrates that the innate immune system plays a crucial role in the first line of defense to eliminate transformed malignant cells and the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells and macrophages are a type of myeloid cell and are important parts of the innate immune system. These cells eliminate cancer cells by phagocytosis and present tumor-derived antigens to T cells, a process known as cross-priming, which activates the adaptive immune system. 
 Cancer cells evade phagocytosis by up-regulating CD47, a transmembrane protein that mainly functions as an anti-phagocytic “don’t eat me” signal for healthy cells. CD47 interacts with its cognate receptor SIRPα, a regulatory membrane glycoprotein, that is expressed on macrophages and other myeloid cells and serves to prevent phagocytosis when bound to CD47. By overexpressing CD47, cancer cells are able to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages and thereby evade subsequent detection by the adaptive immune system. 
 5


High CD47 expression in cancer cells has been shown to be a prognostic indicator of decreased survival in multiple oncology indications. A study published by Majeti, et al. in 2009, assessed this association in a validation cohort of 137 subjects with AML. As shown in the figure below, normal karyotype AML, or NK-AML, subjects with high levels of CD47 expression had shorter median overall survival, or mOS, of 9.1 months compared to subjects with low levels of CD47 expression who had an mOS of 22.1 months. 
 

CD47 as a therapeutic checkpoint target 
 Data generated by our and other studies in the field have demonstrated that activating the immune system against cancer requires both blocking phagocytosis checkpoints and inducing pro-phagocytic signals. This can be achieved by combining CD47 blockade with either conventional chemotherapies or targeted therapies, which together promote phagocytosis by macrophages and maximize adaptive immune system response. 
 Existing anti-cancer therapeutics can increase “eat me” signals on cancer cells. For example, the hypomethylating agent, or HMA, azacitidine activates the immune system by increasing display of calreticulin, a multifunctional protein, on cancer cells. Calreticulin is an important example of a pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal that potentiates immune response when expressed on cancer cells. Therapeutic antibodies that target tumor-specific antigens, such as the HER2 receptor, also induce cellular phagocytosis, but through a slightly different mechanism. These antibodies direct macrophages to cancer cells by binding to the tumor-specific antigen and activating the macrophage by engaging the Fcγ receptors to induce phagocytosis. However, if CD47 is not blocked, the “don’t eat me” signal can limit the activity of this mechanism. CD47 blocking therapies can therefore maximize a combination agent’s clinical efficacy by overcoming the “don’t eat me“ signal that is co-opted by cancer cells.

Our lead product candidate targets CD47 to maximize phagocytosis of cancer cells and activation of the adaptive immune system. 
 

Cancer cells can also modulate their environment to suppress detection by immune cells. Overexpression of CD47 helps cancer cells avoid innate immune system detection by dendritic cells and subsequent antigen presentation to T cells, thereby limiting anti-tumor immune response. PD(L)-1 targeting immunotherapies are designed to reduce the suppression of T cells but do not address the initial evasion of the innate immune system by cancer cells. By removing the suppression of dendritic cells, CD47 blocking therapies in combination with PD(L)-1 targeted therapies can complement their T cell stimulatory activities. 
 Limitations of Current Approaches to Blocking CD47 
 There have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region. These approaches have encountered limitations that have challenged their ability to maximize the full potential of CD47 blockade. These include: 

▪ | Limited dosing and therapeutic window: All clinical data to date from other CD47 blocking agents have come from approaches that incorporate an active Fc region that provides an “eat me” signal to macrophages. Given that healthy blood cells express CD47, the presence of an “eat me” signal coupled with CD47 binding in a single-agent leads to destruction of blood cells. This mechanism is illustrated in the figure below. The trials of these other CD47 blocking agents have resulted in frequent occurrence of treatment-related cytopenias that we believe limits the therapeutic window of these agents. In addition to limiting the dosing, cytopenias can be dangerous for patients undergoing treatment for cancer as they may already have a compromised immune system related to intensive treatment regimens and disease progression. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Limited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents: Combination therapies continue to play an important role in treating patients with cancer. Overlapping toxicities of these agents dictate which agents can and cannot be combined. The overlapping toxicity profiles of other CD47 blocking agents and most other anti-cancer agents create challenges for combination dosing. When combination dosing is possible, the therapeutic benefit of the combination is limited due to the minimal amount of the CD47 blocking agent that can be safely dosed. Moreover, many combinations are precluded entirely due to overlapping toxicity. In addition, an active Fc domain can compete with anti-cancer antibodies when used in combination treatments and can prevent such antibodies from binding with Fcγ receptors on immune cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Limited efficacy in solid tumors: To date, other CD47 blocking agents have failed to achieve meaningful clinical activity in the treatment of solid tumors, as the balance between managing cytopenias and maximizing efficacy may lead to tolerable doses that are too low to facilitate tumor penetration and efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
▪ | Limited indications due to patient selection: Toxicities associated with other CD47 blocking agents may require careful patient selection when evaluating potential indications. In some cases, only subjects with lower risk of hematologic complications have been selected for treatment for other CD47 blocking agents due to drug related risk of severe cytopenias. Sponsors have chosen to initially develop these investigational medicines in indications such as MDS, where patients are often already cytopenic upon presentation and receive regular transfusions, potentially obscuring the side effects of their CD47 blocking approaches.

Advantages of ALX’s Approach to Blocking CD47 
 We founded ALX Oncology because we believed the limitations described above would prevent CD47 blockade from reaching its full potential as a therapy for patients with cancer. From the company’s inception, we designed ALX148 to overcome these limitations and to maximize the utility of CD47 blockade as an effective anti-cancer therapeutic for a broad range of tumors. Specifically, we believe ALX148 may provide the following significant advantages: 
  
▪ | Broader therapeutic window: We believe ALX148’s broader therapeutic window will allow for greater drug exposure than other CD47 blocking agents potentially translating into improved efficacy across a range of cancers, including MDS and AML, compared to other CD47 blocking agents. To date, we have not yet reached a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for ALX148. Furthermore, flexibility in dosing could allow for several administration schedules (weekly, bi-weekly, every three weeks, monthly) that are more amenable to combination therapy dosing schedules, potentially improving a patient’s quality of life. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Strong potential for combination with other anti-cancer agents: CD47 blocking agents are combined with other therapeutics in order to maximize their potential in treating patients with cancer. Unlike other CD47 blocking agents, ALX148 was specifically designed to be combined with other anti-cancer agents. We believe ALX148’s favorable toxicity profile will enable it to be combined with a wider range of anti-cancer agents, including chemotherapy and cytotoxic containing regimens, compared to other CD47 blocking agents. Furthermore, we believe that ALX148’s inactive Fc domain will neither compete with nor potentially limit the efficacy of anti-cancer antibodies when used in combination treatments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Encouraging responses in solid tumors: ALX148 has demonstrated meaningful Phase 1b clinical data in the treatment of solid tumors. While other CD47 blocking agents have failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical activity in solid tumors, ALX148’s differentiated properties may underlie its encouraging results. Based on the data generated with ALX148 in combination with anti-cancer antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors with and without chemotherapy, our strategy is to pursue ALX148 as a potentially critical component for future combination treatment of solid tumors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

▪ | Broader potential indications: We believe ALX148’s tolerability profile will allow for broad treatment of patient populations in a wide range of oncology indications. Toxicities such as cytopenias associated with other CD47 blocking agents may potentially constrain their development strategies. While initial activity of other CD47 blocking agents has been reported in indications such as MDS and AML where many patients already suffer from disease-induced cytopenias, their development in oncology indications that do not include associated cytopenias may be challenged. We believe ALX148 is well positioned to expand the therapeutic potential of CD47 blockade across a broad spectrum of hematologic and solid tumor indications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ALX148 
 Our lead product candidate, ALX148, is a CD47 blocking biologic in development as a combination therapy with other anti-cancer agents for treatment of various oncology indications, including MDS, AML, HNSCC, gastric/GEJ and breast cancer. We engineered ALX148 to maximize CD47 blockade and to avoid hematologic toxicities. We believe ALX148 enhances the efficacy of both anti-cancer targeted antibodies, numerous small molecule drugs and T cell checkpoint inhibitors and exhibits no dose-dependent cytopenias. ALX148 has demonstrated encouraging clinical responses in combination with multiple anti-cancer regimens for both hematologic and solid malignancies. 
 Other companies have pursued CD47 blocking approaches that prioritize single-agent activity, albeit with limited success. Rather than designing a molecule for monotherapy activity that has been associated with cytopenias, we designed ALX148 for use in combination with anti-cancer agents. Our product candidate exclusively blocks the “don’t eat me” pathway. A combination anti-cancer agent provides a specific pro-phagocytic signal on cancer cells. This approach may both increase the specificity to cancer cells and avoid dose-dependent destruction of healthy blood cells. 
 Fusion Protein Design 
 ALX148 is a fusion protein designed to provide a high CD47 blocking potency while potentially eliminating any associated toxicities. Our fusion protein comprises an engineered CD47-binding domain of SIRPα that has been genetically linked to a modified human immunoglobulin-derived Fc domain that does not bind to Fcγ receptors. We engineered ALX148 in two important ways: 

▪ | We mutated the binding domain to optimize CD47 affinity. ALX148 binding domain demonstrates an affinity that is over 3,000 times stronger than wildtype SIRPα.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | We fused the CD47-binding region of SIRPα to an inactive Fc domain. Incorporating an inactive Fc domain was intended to eliminate single-agent activation of macrophages while still maintaining an antibody-like pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The successful design of ALX148 required in-house generation of approximately 280 different protein constructs to thoroughly evaluate and optimize the impact of differing designs on multiple important evaluation criteria. 
 In order to optimize ALX148’s properties we conducted the following processes: 
  
▪ | Design of the high-affinity CD47 binding domain:
--+-------------------------------------------------


▪ | Optimization of binding affinity for human CD47;
--+-------------------------------------------------


▪ | Optimization of cross-reactivity to rodent and monkey CD47 to enable key translational experiments; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Elimination of partially glycosylated sites in SIRPα to remove heterogeneity and enable consistent manufacturing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Design of the optimal fusion combination for PK extension:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Selection of an immunoglobulin isotype to prevent hemagglutination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9


 
▪ | Selection of mutations to immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, to functionally eliminate Fcγ binding and avoid associated cytopenias while maintaining neonatal Fc receptor binding that enables antibody-like PK.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As illustrated in the figure below, ALX148 comprises: 
  
▪ | A SIRPα binding domain optimized to bind to CD47 with high affinity at a picomolar level; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | An inactive Fc domain that reduces cytopenias while preserving the desired PK properties of antibodies with an active Fc domain.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The resulting fusion protein has approximately one-half the molecular weight of a typical antibody. ALX148’s lower molecular weight enables it to deliver the molar equivalent of an antibody at one half the dose. For example, a 30 mg/kg dose of ALX148, the highest level that we have dosed to date, is approximately equivalent to a 60 mg/kg dose of an antibody. ALX148’s lower molecular weight may also facilitate increased solid tumor penetration and provide greater potency within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, ALX148 can be efficiently and consistently produced at high yield at commercial scale utilizing standard monoclonal antibody manufacturing techniques. We believe ALX148’s differentiated properties potentially overcome the limitations of other CD47 blocking agents and may have utility as a combination agent in oncology. 
 Our lead candidate is a fusion protein that potently and selectively binds CD47 to block the SIRPα interaction. 
 

Pre-Clinical Differentiation 
 Our preclinical studies of ALX148 support a target product profile of favorable tolerability, the ability to be dosed in high levels and increased anti-tumor activity as compared to other CD47 blocking agents. These data include the following. 
 Lack of hematologic side effects 
 Our preclinical data demonstrate that CD47 blocking agents with an active Fc domain directly cause adverse hematologic side effects. To support this hypothesis, we engineered a fusion protein with a SIRPα CD47-binding domain identical to ALX148’s binding domain but fused to an active, wild-type IgG1 Fc domain, ALX377. We administered 30 mg/kg ALX148 and 30 mg/kg ALX377 in mouse models and measured red blood cell, or RBC, platelet and white blood cell (lymphocyte, monocytes and granulocytes) counts. As shown in the figure below, mice treated with ALX148 having an inactive Fc domain showed blood count levels that were similar to the pre-dose baseline. In contrast, mice treated with ALX377 having an active Fc domain showed average decreases of 34% in RBC count, 70% in platelet count and 67% in white blood cell count three days post-dosing as compared to baseline counts.

 To further evaluate ALX148’s preclinical tolerability, cynomolgus monkeys were treated by weekly intravenous injections at doses of zero (control), 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg for five consecutive weeks. No toxicity or adverse findings related to CD47 blockade by ALX148 were seen in analysis of RBCs, white blood cells, platelets, body weight, ophthalmic examination, cytokine analysis, ECG parameters and anatomical pathology assessment. The no-observable-adverse-effect-level in the study was the highest dose tested, 100 mg/kg. 
 Together, these preclinical studies demonstrate that inactivation of the Fc domain of ALX148 avoids adverse effects on normal blood cells seen on other CD47 blocking agents with an active Fc domain. They also supported our expectation that ALX148’s lack of overlapping toxicities with other anti-cancer therapies would result in fewer adverse outcomes in a clinic when combined with these therapies than combinations with conventional CD47 blocking agents. 
 ALX148 elicits superior phagocytosis in combination with anti-cancer antibodies 
 The inactive Fc of ALX148 does not compete with the active Fc domain of other therapeutic antibodies for binding with Fcγ receptors on effector cells of the immune system. This fact, coupled with the high-affinity CD47 binding of our agent, results in enhanced phagocytosis from ALX148 in combination with other anti-cancer antibodies to a greater extent than other CD47 blockers. We believe this will allow us to explore ALX148 in combination with a higher number of leading anti-cancer antibodies compared to other CD47 blocking agents in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In order to investigate the potential effects of the Fc domain and CD47 binding affinity on phagocytic activity, we produced two CD47 blocking agents with either an IgG4 or IgG1 active Fc domain, based on published sequences from two other clinical CD47 blockade programs. We combined these agents and ALX148 with cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, inhibitor that is FDA approved for several solid tumors, to assess phagocytic activity as compared to single-agent cetuximab. Both cetuximab and the active Fc domain of a CD47 blocking agent bind to the same cell surface Fcγ receptors on a macrophage, potentially creating competition. IgG1 binds to receptors with higher affinity than IgG4 does, and ALX148’s inactive Fc does not bind. This experiment shows that CD47 blocking agents with active Fc domains and lower affinity, combined with cetuximab result in lower phagocytic activity from macrophages as compared to ALX148 with cetuximab. This experiment suggests ALX148, the only clinical CD47 blocking agent with an inactive Fc domain and high-affinity CD47 binding, may be unique in its anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-tumor antibodies.

ALX148 has shown superior antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or ADCP, of solid tumor cells compared to CD47 blockers with an active Fc domain and lower CD47 affinity when combined with an anti-tumor antibody. 
 

Clinical Data 
 Favorable tolerability profile 
 Clinical trials to date continue to support ALX148’s differentiated approach to CD47 blockade. ALX148 has been administered in over 170 subjects with advanced solid or hematologic malignancies, including in combination with a range of standard of care anti-cancer regimens. ALX148 has been consistently well-tolerated, with low occurrences of cytopenias and other toxicities. Adverse events are reported as of April 1, 2020 for ALX148 combined with Keytruda and Herceptin and as of October 1, 2020 for ALX148 combined with Rituxan, Keytruda plus chemotherapy and Herceptin plus chemotherapy. 
 We have not yet reached a maximum tolerated dose in any trial of ALX148 and are continuing to test higher doses. Because the half-life of ALX148 is longer with higher dose levels, such dosing may allow up to every four weeks, or Q4W, administration schedule. Furthermore, ALX148’s tolerability profile could potentially result in a broad therapeutic window. We believe its tolerability profile to date supports initiation of trials in combination with highly effective, but more toxic, standard of care agents, such as chemotherapies that can cause cytopenias. Many other CD47 blocking agents are unable to combine with these anti-cancer agents due to overlapping toxicity profiles. We believe ALX148 may be uniquely positioned in its ability to combine with standard of care agents including those with associated cytopenias.

Initial data suggests that ALX148 demonstrates a consistent tolerability profile in Phase 1 trial cohorts. 
 

Treatment related adverse events occurring in ≥2 subjects in all histologies at 10 & 15 mg/kg QW.
 *Data cut off: April 1, 2020 for combination cohorts of ALX148 plus Keytruda and Herceptin; October 1, 2020 for combination cohorts of ALX148 plus Rituxan, Keytruda and chemotherapy (5FU, platinum) and Herceptin and chemotherapy (ramucirumab, paclitaxel). 
 Single-digit to no incident rates of treatment-related grade three and higher cytopenias occurred in more than 2 subjects across each of the combination cohorts in this heavily pre-treated group who are typical participants in early stage cancer trials and are often hematologically fragile at baseline. Additionally, the majority of treatment-related adverse events were of low-grade and were easily managed. Overall, ALX148 was well tolerated in an advanced cancer population and can be combined with a wide range of anti-cancer therapeutics. 
 All other CD47 blockers that have reported clinical data have reported high rates of both all grade and high grade cytopenias. A magrolimab clinical trial in solid tumors resulted in 56% anemia in the first 48 subjects dosed, despite each subject receiving an initial priming dose to mitigate anemia. A recent trial of magrolimab in 68 subjects with higher-risk MDS or AML presented in November 2020 (Sallman, SITC 2020, Session 304) reported over 35% grade 3 or 4 treatment-related anemia, over 15% grade 3 or 4 treatment-related neutropenia and over 10% grade 4 treatment-related thrombocytopenia. Such a tolerability profile could present challenges to the administration of this compound as a single agent and in combination. In contrast, ALX148’s tolerability profile may enhance the breadth of clinical development by providing better treatment options for patients with cancer. 
 Clinical PK and PD Data 
 Initial clinical trials have confirmed that ALX148 exhibits favorable PK, and CD47 target occupancy, or TO. Human PK following intravenous, or IV, doses of ALX148 ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg either as a single-agent, or in combination with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab or rituximab have been characterized in 159 subjects as of October 1, 2020. ALX148 single agent PK profiles showed a trend of non-linear PK with faster clearance at lower doses and slower clearance at higher doses of 10 mg/kg QW and 30 mg/kg once every other week, or QOW, indicating saturation of target mediated clearance. 
 The pharmacodynamics, or PD, following AXL148 IV infusion either as a single-agent or in combination with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab or rituximab have been characterized in 156 subjects as of October 1, 2020. Target engagement has been confirmed based on CD47 TO in peripheral blood T lymphocytes and erythrocytes measured by a flow cytometry assay. At lower doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg ALX148 monotherapy, dose dependent increase of TO was observed. Increased TO was observed following the subsequent IV dosing compared to the first IV dose. Complete TO in periphery across the dosing interval, where TO >85%, was observed at ALX148 single 
 13


agent doses ≥3 mg/kg QW and at doses of 30 mg/kg QOW. Complete TO in periphery was observed with ALX148 at doses of 10 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab, or at doses of 10mg/kg QW or 15 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel. 
 In our Phase 1b expansion trial to date, we have observed a statistically significant positive ALX148 exposure-response relationship in subjects with NHL. While our data support full TO in the periphery at 10 mg/kg, enhanced tumor penetration may explain the higher response rate seen at 15 mg/kg in the clinic. Given the favorable tolerability observed to date at doses up to 15 mg/kg QW, we plan to evaluate these higher doses of ALX148. 
 Clinical Development of ALX148 in Hematologic Malignancies 
 The potential therapeutic role of CD47 blockade to date has been clearly demonstrated in hematologic malignancies. This includes both our trials of ALX148 as well as trials by other CD47 blockade programs. We have initiated a clinical trial of ALX148 in patients with MDS and are planning to initiate a trial in the second half of 2021 in patients with AML based on our initial trials in the relapsed/refractory NHL clinical setting, preclinical studies and evidence for the clinical utility of the CD47 blockade from other programs. 
 NHL Proof-of-Principle 
 ALX148’s initial hematologic clinical trial was a Phase 1b expansion trial in combination with rituximab to treat subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL. This was an open-label, multisite trial to assess safety. Subjects received ALX148 10 mg/kg QW or 15 mg/kg QW in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion QW for four doses followed by once monthly for eight doses. In order to meet inclusion criteria, subjects must have had no curative therapy or standard approved therapy option available to them. Across all cohorts, as of October 1, 2020, subjects had received a median of three lines of therapy prior to enrollment in the ALX148 trial. These were heavily pre-treated subjects, all of whom had progressed on previous rituximab-containing regimens. 
 Responses were evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 response criteria and reported as of October 1, 2020. As of October 1, 2020, ALX148 had been administered to 33 subjects. Thirty-two subjects were response evaluable. Eleven subjects had indolent lymphomas and 22 had aggressive lymphomas. There were 11 subjects enrolled to the higher dose 15 mg/kg QW cohort, 10 of whom were response evaluable. This cohort achieved an ORR of 70.0% (7/10). The ORR reported in the lower dose 10 mg/kg QW cohort was 40.9% (9/22).

 We view ALX148’s initial activity in heavily pre-treated subjects with NHL as compelling evidence for the role of ALX148 in treating hematologic malignancies and as a favorable comparison to outcomes reported by other CD47 blocking agents in similar subjects. We believe the initial data in our 10 and 15 mg/kg QW cohorts, which showed a statistically significant exposure-dependent response, demonstrates ALX148’s activity and supports higher dose administration in trials for subjects with MDS. 
 Based on the activities seen at the 10 and 15 mg/kg QW doses coupled with a favorable tolerability profile, we are intending to test higher doses, up to 60 mg/kg Q4W in MDS. We believe this dosing schedule may be unique among CD47 blockade programs and can potentially provide a more convenient regimen in combination with monthly azacitidine for patients. This data set also supported our decision to advance ALX148 into solid tumor indications at higher doses of 45 mg/kg once every three weeks, or Q3W, in combination with standard agents also administered Q3W. 
 ALX148 for the Treatment of MDS 
 Our development of ALX148 in hematologic indications is initially focused on MDS. There are approximately 70,000 people living with diagnosed MDS in the U.S. Patients with MDS have a wide range of expected outcomes that can be estimated from their Revised International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS-R, risk category. Patients with very low IPSS-R have an mOS of 8.8 years, whereas those with very high IPSS-R have an mOS of under ten months. Since nearly 75% of new cases are in patients aged 70 or older, balancing a patient’s age at prognosis with potential treatment-related impact on quality of life is important in considering treatment options. Regardless of age, treatment goals for patients with MDS are a balance of improved survival, symptom alleviation and quality of life. 
 For patients with higher-risk MDS (intermediate, high and very high IPSS-R), standard of care treatments include stem cell transplant, or SCT, high and low-intensity chemotherapy regimens and HMAs. SCT is the only therapy that is potentially curative; however, the procedure is difficult to tolerate, especially for older patients, and has a non-relapse mortality rate of approximately 40% at 200 days for all patients with MDS. 
 15


For patients who are ineligible for SCT, azacitidine, an HMA, is a standard backbone therapy for combination treatment regimens in MDS. The drug continues to be used in combination with investigational agents in a number of current MDS trials. Single-agent azacitidine is one of the few FDA-approved agents for patients with MDS. However, its FDA label indicates a complete response, or CR, rate of only 5.6% and an mOS of 2.0 years. A clinical complete response comprises normalizing peripheral blood counts, resolution of bone marrow dysplasia and reduction in the percentage of immature blood cells, or myeloblasts, to less than 5%. CD47 blockade in combination with azacitidine has shown early clinical evidence that suggests it may improve CR rates in MDS. For patients with higher-risk MDS, achieving a CR and improving overall survival are the central treatment goals. Treatment goals for patients with lower-risk MDS are different. The primary goal for those patients is resolution of cytopenias. 
 Red blood cell transfusions are a key element of treatment intended to address cytopenias in patients with MDS. The majority of patients have a hemoglobin count of less than 10 g/dL and approximately one-third of patients are RBC transfusion dependent. Transfusions impose significant time and cost burdens on patients and also cause clinical sequelae such as iron overload and associated liver fibrosis and cardiomyopathy. Therefore, achieving transfusion independence is an important secondary goal of treating patients with higher-risk MDS. A competitive CD47 blocking agent has generated encouraging clinical data, however, it is associated with high rates of anemia that may require additional transfusions upon treatment initiation, mitigating any success in peripheral blood count normalization. 
 The current clinical experience with CD47 blocking agents in MDS underscores the need for combination therapy to increase CR rates above that seen with standard of care azacitidine monotherapy. As previously discussed, pro-phagocytic signals in ALX148-based combinations can be provided by drugs that increase display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin on the surface of tumor cells. We have conducted preclinical studies that showed that azacitidine and venetoclax increase both the display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin and the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 on AML cells, suggesting that a CD47 blocking agent could maximize the activity of venetoclax and azacitidine in these models. Additionally, we have shown that ALX148 with venetoclax or azacitidine in combination produces increased phagocytosis in vitro and anti-tumor activity in mouse models compared to azacitidine or venetoclax alone. 
 16


Furthermore, combination treatment of ALX148 with azacitidine or venetoclax led to tumor elimination and prolonged survival in leukemia mouse models. Azacitidine and ALX148 monotherapies produced moderate tumor growth inhibition with all mice succumbing to disease by day 85 post inoculation. In contrast, the combination of ALX148 and azacitidine completely eliminated tumor growth with 100% animal survival up to study termination on day 147. We have also demonstrated in preclinical studies that ALX148 when combined with venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with AML, led to tumor elimination in a leukemia tumor model. 
 

Recent data from a competitive CD47 blockade program, magrolimab, further support trials of ALX148 for treatment of MDS. Magrolimab was studied both as a single-agent and in combination with azacitidine in subjects with higher-risk MDS or AML. As reported at ASCO 2020, magrolimab plus azacitidine achieved a 42% CR rate in previously untreated MDS and a 40% CR in previously untreated AML. As a single-agent, magrolimab achieved no CRs in relapsed/refractory MDS and AML, suggesting that a separate pro-phagocytic signal is required for the observed clinical activity. Despite the high rate of CRs achieved in combination, over 38% of subjects in these trials have experienced grade 3 or higher treatment-related anemia. Notwithstanding these limitations, magrolimab’s data support the potential role of CD47 blockade in treating these subjects. 
 Our strategy is to pursue ALX148 as a potentially critical component for future combination treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS. Our preclinical models, activity of ALX148 in NHL where magrolimab has reported similar data and available CD47 clinical data in this indication support a potential role for ALX148 for treatment of patients with MDS. Baseline characteristics of subjects in a recent trial of azacitidine plus venetoclax in treatment-naïve higher-risk MDS illustrated the need for therapies that do not induce cytopenias. Prior to treatment, 56% of subjects had grade 3 or higher neutropenia, 33% had grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia, 40% had grade 3 or higher leukopenia and 12% had grade 3 or higher anemia. We believe that it is important to develop a CD47 blocking therapy that does not exacerbate cytopenias that patients may already exhibit pre-treatment. ALX148’s tolerability profile to date suggests it may address this unmet need in patients who suffer from MDS. 
 In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial of ALX148 in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of subjects with higher-risk MDS. The Phase 1b portion of the trial will seek to evaluate up to 60 mg/kg Q4W of ALX148 plus standard azacitidine in subjects with relapsed/refractory and previously untreated MDS. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will assess the combination of ALX148 and azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated higher-risk MDS. The primary endpoint will be complete remission rate by six months. We intend to pursue a strategy in which we will leverage the data generated from the Phase 1b/2 trial to request from the FDA that ALX148 be a candidate for accelerated approval in the treatment of MDS.

ALX148 for the treatment of AML 
 Our preclinical studies and clinical trials from competing CD47 agents support the potential role of ALX148 in the treatment of patients with AML. In the United States, there are over 35,000 people living with AML with an expected 20,000 newly diagnosed cases and over 11,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Overall survival for patients with AML is generally worse than patients with higher-risk MDS. Median overall survival for patients with AML ranges from approximately 15 months for patients with favorable cytogenetic risk factors to less than 5 months for those with adverse risk factors. Similar to MDS, patients tend to be older with a median age at diagnosis of 68. 
 First-line treatment options for patients can be broadly stratified into high-intensity and low-intensity induction regimens. High-intensity induction chemotherapy is typically cytarabine plus an anthracycline (so called “7+3”) administered over a 28-day cycle. While patients can derive long term benefit from 7+3, the risks of the regimen are substantial. 60-day treatment-related mortality from 7+3 induction have been as high as 27% and have declined to 6-8% in recent years, likely due in part to more stringent patient selection and the decreased average age of patients who receive 7+3. Patients who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy due to preference, performance status, or other reasons are likely to receive low-intensity regimens characterized by the use of HMAs, venetoclax or combined HMA plus venetoclax. In the past decade, the percentage of patients 65 and older who receive first-line high-intensity treatment has declined from approximately 70% to 40%, while the use of HMAs in this population increased from 11% to 44%. Venetoclax combined with an HMA recently received approval from the FDA for use in adults who are 75 years or older or who have comorbidities that exclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. In the Phase 3 VIALE-A trial, venetoclax achieved a 37% CR rate in combination with azacitidine and a median duration of CR of 18.0 months. Despite these results, we believe there is a significant unmet need for more effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment options for patients who are not candidates for high-intensity therapy. 
 The mechanistic rationale for combining ALX148 with azacitidine in AML is similar to the rationale for MDS. Preclinical studies show that azacitidine increases the display of calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic signal, on cancer cells in AML models. The preclinical studies that support the use of ALX148 combinations in MDS also support its use in AML. Clinically, the CD47 agent magrolimab has achieved a 40% CR rate in untreated AML when used in combination with azacitidine. In a separate study in patients 65 and older with untreated AML, single-agent azacitidine as achieved a 20% CR rate. We believe this indicates CD47 agents could increase the activity of HMAs above their single-agent levels. Furthermore, our preclinical data of ALX148 in combination with venetoclax supports the combination with this agent that is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with AML. 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 trial of ALX148 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for the first-line treatment of patients with AML in the second half of 2021. 
 ALX148 in Solid Tumors 
 We have generated clinical data with ALX148 in combination with multiple anti-cancer agents in solid tumors. We believe the smaller molecular weight of ALX148 as compared to a typical antibody may facilitate greater penetration into solid tumors. In addition, we believe the favorable tolerability profile of ALX148 will allow for higher administered doses in a range of combination strategies with leading therapies for solid tumors. Solid tumors represent the largest markets within oncology and many of these oncology indications are poorly served by current therapies, both in front-line as well as in the relapsed and refractory settings. We have demonstrated proof of concept with ALX148 in combination treatment in two solid tumor settings in initial clinical trials: HNSCC and HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. We believe these indications offer registration pathways in combination with existing approved therapies and we intend to advance ALX148 into randomized Phase 2 trials in both oncology indications in 2021. 
 ALX148 can be combined with PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-(L)1, agents in a broad range of solid tumors. As part of our development strategy, we are exploring the use of ALX148 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor with and without chemotherapy in HNSCC. PD-(L)1 inhibitors are currently approved by the FDA for 18 indications and had over $20 billion in 2019 sales. Other CD47 blocking approaches may be limited in their ability to combine with PD-(L)1 inhibitors due to cumulative or overlapping toxicities. 
 18


We investigated ALX148 in subjects with solid tumors in additional cohorts as part of an extensive Phase 1 trial. Part 1 was a dose escalation trial of single-agent ALX148 intended to examine tolerability and recommended dosing and was not expected to show single-agent activity. Sixteen subjects with solid tumors received ALX148 as a single-agent on a QW schedule at doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg and 12 subjects received ALX148 as a single-agent on a QoW dosing schedule at a dose of 30 mg/kg. The maximum tolerated dose was not determined on either schedule. However, the maximum administered dose was 30 mg/kg for the Q2W dosing schedule and 10 mg/kg for the QW schedule. 
 Part 2 was comprised of ALX148 escalation and expansion cohorts. In subjects with solid tumors, ALX148 was combined with various anti-cancer agents including pembrolizumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Adverse events from these cohorts are reported above. As previously discussed, ALX148 has consistently displayed a favorable tolerability profile. Many of the reported adverse events have been associated with either pembrolizumab or trastuzumab. 
 In HNSCC, our initial Phase 1b expansion trial combined ALX148 with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 agent, which is a standard of care for subjects with HNSCC. Final results from the cohort of ALX148 combined with pembrolizumab were reported at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology, Virtual Scientific Program, or ASCO 2020, and provided the first demonstration of ALX148’s ability to enhance checkpoint inhibitor antibody activity in solid tumors and is the basis for FDA Fast Track designation in first-line treatment of HNSCC. Data from this trial supported our second trial in HNSCC that adds chemotherapy (5-fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin) to the combination of pembrolizumab and ALX148 and preliminary data for this cohort was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting, or SITC 2020. We also recently entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Merck to study the combination of ALX148 and pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in a randomized Phase 2 trial. 
 In HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer, our Phase 1b expansion trial included a combination with trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 agent, that is the standard of care for subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer and is FDA-approved for other HER2-expressing tumors. Final results from the cohort of ALX148 combined with trastuzumab were reported at ASCO 2020 and provided the first demonstration of ALX148 activity with an anti-tumor targeted antibody in subjects with solid tumors. Data from this trial formed the basis for FDA Fast Track designation in second-line subjects with advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer and supported our second trial in gastric/GEJ cancer that adds second-line standard of care agents (ramucirumab plus paclitaxel) to the combination of trastuzumab and ALX148. Preliminary data for this cohort was also presented at SITC 2020. 
 We also plan to advance ALX148 into a Phase 1 clinical trial in combination with zanidatamab, an investigational anti-HER2 bispecific antibody, in patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors. We recently entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks, the developer of zanidatamab, to explore this combination. 
 Overall, we believe our development plan for ALX148 in solid tumors has significant potential and represents a strong complement to our program in hematologic malignancies. With encouraging data in multiple drug combinations initially evaluated in the clinic, we plan to advance trials to assess efficacy in the solid tumor indications with substantial unmet medical need. 
 ALX148 in HNSCC 
 Disease background 
 There are estimated to be over 38,000 people living in the United States with metastatic HNSCC, with over 50,000 newly incident cases at all stages estimated to be diagnosed in 2020. Five-year survival is 85% for patients diagnosed with localized disease but decreases to only 40% for those diagnosed with metastatic disease, underlying the need for improved treatment options. 
 19


FDA-approved and National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recommended therapies for the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease include pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy, platinum and fluorouracil, and cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, combined with chemotherapy among other treatments. The KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1 on a Combined Positive Score, or CPS, ≥1 and approval of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with HNSCC regardless of CPS . In KEYNOTE-048, pembrolizumab monotherapy achieved 17% ORR with a median progression-free survival, or mPFS, of 2.3 months in subjects with HNSCC regardless of CPS. Of particular note, in subjects with CPS <1 pembrolizumab monotherapy only achieved a 5% ORR. 
 Pembrolizumab monotherapy in previously treated HNSCC was reported in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 trial. Subjects were excluded if they had prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. In KEYNOTE-040, pembrolizumab achieved a 15% ORR, mPFS of only 2.1 months and mOS of 8.4 months. While we believe pembrolizumab is an important treatment option for both first- and second-line HNSCC, the majority of patients do not have an objective response to pembrolizumab-based therapy. 
 Despite the recent approval of pembrolizumab, we believe that there is significant unmet need remaining for patients with HNSCC. The addition of ALX148 to pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, may have the potential to improve response rates and provide additional clinical benefit to patients with metastatic HNSCC. We have evaluated ALX148 in subjects with metastatic HNSCC and continue to develop ALX148 in this setting. 
 Trial design 
 ALX148 was investigated in two combinations and lines of therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. First, ALX148 was investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC who had received at least one prior systemic therapy. The clinical evaluation of ALX148 in HNSCC was an open-label, multisite expansion of our Phase 1 trial to assess safety and tolerability with response rate and duration as secondary endpoints. There was no requirement for PD-L1 expression. Subjects received ALX148 10 mg/kg QW in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg on a Q3W dosing schedule. Subject response was evaluated based on RECIST version 1.1. Twenty subjects were dosed with ALX148 and as of October 1, 2020, all subjects in the ALX148 with pembrolizumab HNSCC expansion cohort were response evaluable. Because standard of care in first-line HNSCC was evolving during the course of this trial to include checkpoint inhibitors, 50% (10) of the subjects who enrolled were checkpoint inhibitor naïve and 50% (10) had previously received a checkpoint inhibitor. 
 Additionally, ALX148 was investigated in the ongoing trial of ALX148 in combination with pembrolizumab, 5FU and platinum therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC who had received no prior treatment for advanced disease. As of October 1, 2020, five subjects had been dosed and four were response evaluable. 
 Outcomes 
 The primary objective of the trial was to assess safety. Final results of the fully enrolled ALX148 with pembrolizumab cohort and partially enrolled ALX148 plus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy cohort were reported at SITC 2020. As reported above in the summary tables of treatment-related adverse events from all ALX148 trials, the combination was well tolerated. As of October 1, 2020, ALX148 with pembrolizumab achieved an ORR of 40% (4/10) in checkpoint inhibitor naïve subjects while maintaining a tolerability profile consistent with earlier trials. Some of the 20 subjects had a CPS of zero and response was also observed within this subject population. We believe the addition of ALX148 to pembrolizumab represents a potentially significant advance over pembrolizumab monotherapy based on a review of the KEYNOTE-040 trial results that showed an ORR of 15% in a similar checkpoint inhibitor therapy naïve population. Based on our clinical trial data, the FDA granted ALX148 Fast Track designation for first-line treatment of subjects with HNSCC. ALX148 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy 
 20


achieved an ORR of 75% (3/4), including a complete response, in subjects who had received no prior treatment for advanced disease. 
 


Notes: Data Cutoff October 1, 2020. Subjects who received at least one dose of ALX148 in the expansion phase, had a baseline assessment, and at least one post-baseline disease assessment. ORR = Overall Response Rate. DCR = disease control rate. DOR = duration of response. mPFS = median progression free survival. mOS = median overall survival. NC = not calculated. CI = confidence interval. ITT Intent to treat population in chemotherapy cohort: HNSCC (10+15 mg/kg) N=5; HNSCC (15mg/kg) N=2 
 We also analyzed paired pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies from subjects for the presence of CD8+ T cells, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells. After treatment with ALX148, tumor samples showed increased infiltration of CD8+, CD68+ and CD163+ cells in the tumor, which suggests that ALX148 also engages the innate and adaptive immune system consistent with its mechanism of action. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Our HNSCC development plan is to build on the initial results of ALX148 in checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients in combination with pembrolizumab. Given the results of KEYNOTE-048, we expect pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, to continue to be widely used in the first-line treatment of metastatic HNSCC. Therefore, our future plans will be focused on establishing additional efficacy, in the context of acceptable safety 
 21


and tolerability, over pembrolizumab alone, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, in the front-line metastatic HNSCC setting. In January 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b trial that is evaluating ALX148 plus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in subjects with no PD-L1 expression requirements. In addition to our initial dosing of 10 mg/kg QW, a higher dosing will be explored with 15 mg/kg QW dosing planned. In September 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Merck to evaluate ALX148 in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in two randomized Phase 2 trials in subjects with HNSCC who have not received prior therapy for advanced disease. The first trial will evaluate the efficacy of ALX148 in combination with pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with PD-L1 expressing metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC. The second trial will evaluate ALX148 in combination with pembrolizumab and standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC. In December 2020, the FDA verbally informed us, that given our planned initiation of two randomized Phase 2 HNSCC clinical trials that could be potentially registrational, they require completion of a routine non-clinical safety study that we currently have in process. The FDA noted that for any drug development program moving swiftly through development, this non-clinical study is still required prior to the initiation of a clinical trial that could be considered pivotal. We are allowed to initiate both Phase 2 HNSCC clinical trials with the enrollment capped at a total of 50 subjects treated with ALX148 across both trials (excluding safety lead-in cohorts) pending acceptance of the non-clinical safety study report. We expect to provide the required report to the FDA prior to reaching the 50-patient enrollment cap. While this cap on enrollment is defined as a partial clinical hold, no delays are anticipated in our current clinical trial timelines. 
 ALX148 in HER2-Positive Gastric/GEJ 
 Disease background 
 Over 25,000 people are estimated to be living in the United States with diagnosed metastatic gastric/GEJ carcinoma. A large, international Phase 3 trial of trastuzumab in gastric/GEJ cancer found that of the nearly 4,000 subjects screened for inclusion in the trial, 17% of them were HER2-positive, which suggests a general HER2-positive rate for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. In East Asian countries, gastric/GEJ cancer is much more common than in the United States, with incidence rates 4-10 times higher. China alone has a diagnosed incidence of over 900,000 patients with gastric/GEJ cancer per year. 
 First-line standard of care treatment is trastuzumab combined with the chemotherapy agents platinum and fluoropyrimidine. Trastuzumab, marketed as Herceptin, is an anti-HER2 antibody that has multiple FDA approvals in patients with HER2-positive cancers. In the second-line HER2-positive gastric setting, there are no HER2 targeted FDA-approved therapies. As such, the standard of care regimen in the U.S. is ramucirumab, marketed as Cyramza, a vascular endothelial growth factor 2 receptor monoclonal antibody, in combination with paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy. In a Phase 3 trial leading to FDA approval, ramucirumab plus paclitaxel achieved a 28% ORR with a 9.6 month mOS in subjects with previously treated gastric/GEJ cancer. 
 HER2-positive patients with gastric/GEJ cancers in second-line treatment are likely to have received an anti-HER2 antibody-based treatment in their first line of treatment. A recently reported prospective clinical trial studied trastuzumab plus paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in previously treated HER2-positive subjects with gastric/GEJ cancer. Subjects were required to have progressed during the first line of treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine plus platinum). The objective of this trial was to assess the clinical effect of trastuzumab after patients had progressed on prior trastuzumab treatment. The trial results showed that the addition of trastuzumab added no meaningful clinical benefit over paclitaxel alone. There was no significant improvement in mOS, mPFS or ORR compared to the paclitaxel arm. Based on these data, we hypothesized that we could attribute any observed responses when treating a similar subject population with ALX148 paired with trastuzumab, to a combination effect of the two agents and not simply a response to trastuzumab alone. 
 Trial design 
 ALX148 was investigated in two combinations in subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. First, ALX148 was investigated with trastuzumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. This trial was an open-label, multisite expansion of our Phase 1 trial to assess safety and tolerability with response rate and duration as secondary endpoints. Twenty subjects from the gastric/GEJ expansion cohort received ALX148 10 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg intravenous infusion Q3W. As of October 1, 2020, 19 subjects were response evaluable. One of the twenty subjects administered ALX148 discontinued the trial due to clinical symptoms of progression prior to their first scheduled on trial scan and therefore was not response evaluable per protocol definition. 
 22


As of April 1, 2020, in our trial of ALX148 plus trastuzumab, 18 of 19 response evaluable subjects from the gastric/GEJ expansion cohort, including all subjects who achieved a response, had been treated with at least one HER2-containing regimen prior to enrollment. Multiple subjects also received an investigational anti-HER2 agent and a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor as prior treatment. 
 Additionally, ALX148 was investigated with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel in subjects with relapsed/refractory HER2-postive gastric/GEJ cancer who had progressed on prior trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine or platinum. As of October 1, 2020, 14 subjects had enrolled, all of whom were response evaluable. 
 Outcomes 
 
Data Cutoff October 1, 2020. Subjects who received at least one dose of ALX148 in the expansion phase, had a baseline assessment, and at least one post-baseline disease assessment. One subject administered ALX148+pembrolizumab with rapid fatal clinical progression is not included in plots. ORR = Overall Response Rate. DOR = duration of response. mPFS = median progression free survival. mOS = median overall survival. CI = confidence interval. ND = Not Done. HER2 Score retrospectively assessed using archival tissue by a central IHC lab. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to assess safety and the combination regimen was well tolerated. Final results of the fully enrolled cohort were reported at SITC 2020. Importantly, ALX148 with trastuzumab achieved an ORR of 21.1% (4/19) in subjects treated with the doublet and an ORR of 64.3% (9/14) in subjects treated with ALX148 with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel. The FDA granted ALX148 Fast Track designation for second-line treatment of advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ carcinoma partly due to the data for ALX148 in combination with trastuzumab alone for the treatment of gastric cancer. Based on prior studies, one of which is 
 23


described above, any observed response can likely be attributed to the combination effect and not a response to single-agent trastuzumab. As described above, ramucirumab and paclitaxel in a second-line setting resulted in an ORR of 28% in a Phase 3 trial leading to FDA approval. We believe that an ORR of 64.3% in this second-line or later population supports further development of ALX148 in HER2-positive cancers. 
 Clinical development plans 
 We intend to initiate a randomized Phase 2 trial of ALX148 with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab (or other HER2-directed therapy), and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy as the first line of therapy for advanced disease, by the second half of 2021. Data from this trial would confirm whether ALX148 improves the response rate to anti-HER2-based therapy in patients with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. Of note, there are multiple emerging agents, predominantly antibody-based therapies, in development for patients with HER2-positive cancer. Because these agents target HER2 as does trastuzumab, we believe that ALX148 has the potential to maximize the anti-cancer activity of these novel agents should they supplant trastuzumab in the treatment paradigm for these patients. 
 ALX148 in HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors 
 We plan to continue developing ALX148 in a broad range of tumor types and in novel combinations. In November 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks to investigate ALX148 in combination with Zymeworks’ HER2-targeted bispecific antibody, zanidatamab, in patients with advanced HER2-expressing tumors. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Zymeworks will conduct an open label, multi-center Phase 1b trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of zanidatamab and ALX148 in a two-part trial. The first part of the trial will evaluate the safety of the combination treatment. The second part of the trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of the combination in separate cohorts of subjects with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer and non-breast HER2-expressing solid tumors. 
 Research Programs 
 We also have a preclinical program focused on developing a SIRPα TRAAC that may offer additional ways to engage the innate and adaptive immune response to cancer. SIRPα TRAAC is complementary to our CD47 blocker approach. SIRPα is expressed on myeloid cells and dendritic cells which have TLR9, an intracellular receptor present in a wide variety of immune cells, including B-cells, myeloid cells and dendritic cells. TRAAC, or TLR9 agonist antibody conjugate, is designed specifically for compatibility with antibody conjugation, superior pharmacokinetics, receptor-mediated uptake, and TLR9 stimulation with the potential for intravenous administration. SIRPα TRAAC is an agonistic molecule targeting myeloid cells and directly activates them, resulting in cytokine release, antigen presentation, and initiation of a coordinated innate and adaptive immune response against cancer. 
Licensing and Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and knowhow and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and related components, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, knowhow, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As of March 1, 2021, we own two issued U.S. patents, nine pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, twelve pending U.S. provisional patent applications and a portfolio of national patent application filings in a variety of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Europe, Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Russia. Of these patents and patent applications, the 
 24


following relate to ALX148: two issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, twelve pending U.S. provisional patent applications and a portfolio of national patent application filings in a variety of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Europe, Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Russia. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. Our two U.S. issued patents and, if issued as U.S. patents, our ten U.S. nonprovisional patent applications and twelve U.S. provisional patent applications are expected to expire between August 2036 and February 2042, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, with an expiration of between August 2036 and December 2041 with respect to our patent and patent applications related to ALX148, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. 
 We obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license from the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, under certain patents relating to high-affinity SIRPα variant polypeptides, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for use in certain licensed fields, the scope of which would include the application of the licensed intellectual property in oncology. Our portfolio of exclusively licensed patents from Stanford includes six issued patents (one of which is in the United States) and applications are pending in five jurisdictions (including the United States and the European Patent Office). For more information regarding our license agreement with Stanford, please see “—Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University.” 
 Our patent portfolio exclusively licensed from Stanford contains patent families relating to high-affinity SIRPα variant polypeptides, which includes one issued patent in each of U.S., Australia, China, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan, one pending U.S. patent application and one pending European patent application. The European patent has been validated as national patents in 37 different European countries. These patents and patent applications are subject to retained rights by Stanford to allow academic and nonprofit research institutions to practice the licensed technology and patents for noncommercial purposes. In addition, these patents are subject to certain pre-existing rights that Stanford has granted to two third parties. These patents are expected to expire in 2033 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. 
 We are aware of a revoked European patent (EP 2 429 574) owned by UHN and The Hospital for Sick Children that may encompass certain therapies for the treatment of cancer using polypeptides comprising soluble human SIRPα, or a CD47-binding fragment thereof. This revoked patent related to the treatment of cancer with polypeptides comprising soluble human SIRPα, or a CD47-binding fragment thereof. This patent was revoked by the European Patent Office and UHN and The Hospital for Sick Children have appealed the decision.  If UHN and the Hospital for Sick Children win their appeal of the European Patent Office decision revoking their European patent, the resulting patent claims could potentially limit our ability to pursue ALX148 in certain new indications or geographies in the future. The U.S. counterpart was recently granted as US patent 10,907,209.  However, we believe that we do not infringe claims listed in this U.S. patent.
 For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, including the above referenced intellectual property proceedings, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University 
 In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement, or the Stanford Agreement, with Stanford under which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patents relating to our current product candidates, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for use in certain licensed fields, the scope of which would include the application of the licensed intellectual property in oncology. The license granted to us in the Stanford Agreement includes an exclusive grant, subject to certain pre-existing non-exclusive or exclusive rights that Stanford retained for grant to third parties with respect to certain categories of the licensed patents in certain fields of use and retained rights by Stanford and all other nonprofit institutions to use and practice the licensed patents and technology for internal research and other nonprofit purposes. The license granted to us in the Stanford Agreement also includes non-exclusive grants to certain Stanford patents. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Stanford Agreement, we paid Stanford a nonrefundable license royalty and reimbursed Stanford for past patent expenses, together totaling less than $0.1 million, and granted Stanford a specified number of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Stanford ongoing 
 25


patent expenses and an annual license maintenance fee, which are nominal and will be creditable against any royalties payable to Stanford in the applicable year. We are required to make milestone payments up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in respect of a specified number of licensed products that successfully satisfy certain clinical and regulatory milestones. No milestone payments have been made through December 31, 2020. We also agreed to pay Stanford tiered royalties on a specified percentage of net sales made by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products at rates ranging within low single-digit percentages, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our license, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, shall become royalty-free and fully paid-up upon the later of the date on which the last valid claim included in the exclusively or non-exclusively licensed patents expires and ten years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. 
 We may terminate the Stanford Agreement, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, at any time for any reason by providing at least 60 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate the Stanford Agreement if we are in breach of any provision of the Stanford Agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after written notice of such breach by Stanford. In addition, Stanford has the right to terminate the Stanford Agreement, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such licensed product under certain conditions or if we fail to achieve specified development milestones for such licensed product by certain dates, subject to our extension rights. 
 Other Third-Party Agreements 
 We have entered into license agreements with third parties related to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including ALX148, and SIRPα antibodies which we are exploring in our research program. In consideration of the foregoing, we have agreed to customary payments terms in these agreements, including certain milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and low single-digit royalties. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations and Commitments—License and Collaboration Agreements.” 
Commercialization 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We rely on, and will continue to rely on, CMOs for both drug substance and drug product. Both ALX148 bulk drug substance and finished drug product are produced in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. 
 Our existing supply of ALX148 drug product is sufficient to complete our clinical trials through the first half of 2021. We plan to manufacture additional supplies with our existing CMOs to produce ALX148 drug product sufficient to complete the ongoing and planned clinical trials described in this document. We first entered into an engagement with KBI Biopharma, Inc. in 2015 for analytical method development, formulation development, bulk drug manufacturing, release and stability testing. We first entered into a drug product manufacturing agreement with Lyophilization Services of New England, Inc. in 2016 and have subsequently used them for all ALX148 drug product used in clinical trials to date. 
 26


Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new product candidates is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ALX148 and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others. We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immune-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer. There are other companies working to develop immuno-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. The large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer include AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. 
 Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, including with respect to the targeting of CD47 pathway and others are based on entirely different approaches. We are aware that Apexigen, Arch Therapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences (through its recent acquisition of Forty Seven), I-Mab, Innovent, Kahr, Novimmune, OSE Immunotherapeutics and Trillium Therapeutics, among others, are developing drugs targeting the CD47 pathway that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA, regulates biologic products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. Biologic products and substances are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 27


The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
 U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 The process generally involves the following: 
  
▪ | Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency (i.e., safety and effectiveness) of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Satisfactory completion of any FDA audit of preclinical studies and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 The data required to support a BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 28


The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, including pharmacology, PK, toxicokinetic and metabolism studies, that support subsequent clinical testing in humans. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new biopharmaceutical product to humans. 
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises any concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial(s) and places the trial(s) on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
▪ | Phase 1. For biologics being studied in oncology indications, the investigational product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and additional information on PK and PD. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.

▪ | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, purity and potency for an intended use, and generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its biopharmaceutical substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 30


If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval preapproval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 31


Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat patients with a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration, biopharmaceutical product listing, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplement submission, which may require the development of additional preclinical studies, clinical trials, data and/or assays, such as comparability protocols. 
 32


The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
▪ | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. 
 Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA approved reference biological product. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 33


Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Additionally, prescribing physicians are free to specify “Do Not Substitute” in prescriptions, which would prohibit pharmacists from substituting a branded biologic product for a biosimilar product. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and impact of the BPCIA are subject to uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Biopharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Research, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following: 

▪ | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act, or FCA. In addition, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to eliminate the need to prove specific intent and actual knowledge to establish an Anti-Kickback Statute violation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The federal civil and criminal false claims, including the FCA that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The civil monetary penalties laws impose penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 34


 
▪ | The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additionally, President Trump signed into law in 2018 the “Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act” which, under the provision entitled “Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine,” in part, extends the reporting and transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other mid-level practitioners, with reporting requirements beginning in 2022 for payments made or ownership or investment interests held in 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, price reporting, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. For example, products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-referral and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to comply with the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report certain information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, such as stock-option compensation paid to physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The growth of our business and sales organization and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payors may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products to obtain third-party payor coverage, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

Other Healthcare Laws 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, a new licensure framework for follow on biologic products, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. However, on April 27, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Federal Circuit decision that previously upheld Congress’ denial of $12 billion in “risk corridor” funding. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments and is expected to issue a decision by mid-2021. It is uncertain how the Supreme Court will rule on this case. We cannot predict how this decision or future litigation will impact our business, or what other healthcare measures and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation may have on our business.
 37


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which  went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Additionally, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. For example, on August 6, 2020, the Trump administration issued another executive order that instructs the federal government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy them and other medical supplies from U.S. manufacturers instead of from companies around the world, including China. The order is meant to reduce regulatory barriers to domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and catalyze manufacturing technologies needed to keep drug prices low and the production of drug products in the United States. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020, codifying a policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of these new rules. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued a “regulatory freeze” memorandum that directs department and agency heads to review new or pending rules of the prior administration. It is unclear whether these new regulations will be withdrawn or when they will become fully effective under the current administration. The impact of these lawsuits as well as legislative, executive, and administrative actions of the current administration on us and the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These and other new laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our biopharmaceutical products, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations. 
 Additionally, the Right to Try Act, which was enacted on May 30, 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 23 employees, 11 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 12 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
