OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA
 
Baidu, Wechat, Linkedin, Twitter,  and the list goes on. Diversifying our social media presence means expanding our client base.
 
EMPLOYEES; IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES.
 
We have no employees other than our sole officer and director, Reinis Kosins. We have executed a Consulting Agreement with our sole officer and director Reinis Kosins. Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Registration Statement.
 
We do not have tutors currently working for us. We intend to employ tutors as we receive translation request through our website from our clients. To date we have not had any tutoring requests. Our tutors will be self employed contractors. They will be paid a percentage (70%) of the fees we receive for the tutoring service.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 We will be subject to applicable laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including United States securities laws. We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in China.
 Under Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Peoples Republic of China Corporate Income Tax Law (the Corporate Income Law), any foreign enterprise which shall constitute a resident enterprise shall meet both of the following requirements: (i) such enterprise was established under the laws of foreign countries or regions; and (ii) the actual management of such enterprise must be located within China. Further, under relevant provisions of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding the Issues Relevant to the Identification of Chinese-controlled Enterprises Registered Abroad as Resident Enterprises by Actual Management (Guo Shui Fa [2009] No. 82, Circular No. 82) issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 and based upon our no-name inquiry to the Peoples Republic of China State Administration for Taxation, any Chinese-controlled enterprise whose actual management is held to be located within China shall satisfy all of the following requirements: (i) the site, where the management of such enterprise responsible for the daily operation of such enterprise performs its duties, is located within China; (ii) the financial decisions (such as borrowings, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and HR policies (such as appointment, dismissal or remunerations) shall be made or approved by the institution or personnel of such enterprise staying within China; (iii) 1/2 or more of the directors with voting rights or of the management of such enterprise live within China permanently; and (iv) the main assets, accounting books and stamps of and the minutes and files of the board of directors of and of shareholders meeting of such enterprise exist and will be maintained within China.
 
We believe that we are not considered a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. We have no subsidiaries within China. We have executive offices in China, and all of our management is located within China. We make or approve the financial decisions (such as borrowing, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and human resource policies (such as employees appointment, dismissal and remunerations) within China, and our sole director with voting rights are also

located within China. However, our main assets, accounting books, stamps and minutes of our directors board and of our shareholders meetings exist and will be maintained in the USA but not within China, so we are not consistent with Item (iv) of the above four requirements under Circular No. 82 although our present conditions satisfy Items (i) to (iii) of the above requirements under Circular No. 82. Therefore, even if we are an enterprise established under the laws Nevada, and our management team is located within China, we believe that we shall not be held to be a resident enterprise under the Corporate Income Tax Law.
 
Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that there is a difference or discrepancy between the interpretation of the Chinese authorities and our understanding as set forth above, nor can we assure that the statements or interpretations of the Chinese government officials will remain unchanged. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Chinese government will promulgate any new laws, regulations or provisions that will be in conflict with our understanding. If so, we may be classified as a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.
 
If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations.
 
If we are considered a resident enterprise, this could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares and a 20% withholding tax on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual stockholders from transferring our shares. If we are required under PRC law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.
 
Government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of the China may adopt policies which have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance that the government of China will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform. In addition, a substantial portion of productive assets in China remains government-owned. For instance, all lands are state owned and business entities or individuals are granted by government state-owned land use rights. The granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting, which could be lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect our business. The government of China also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency, the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises, as well as adverse changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China.

EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS UNDER THE JOBS ACT
 
 Crucial Innovations, Corp. qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act).
  The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuers known as "emerging growth companies." Emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion (as indexed for inflation) during their most recently completed fiscal year. The JOBS Act is intended to facilitate public offerings by emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and its regulations. An emerging growth company will retain that status until the earliest of:
 
The first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed $1 billion; 
 
The first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its IPO; 
 
The date on which the company has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period; and 
 
The first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least $700 million. 
 
FINANCIAL AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
 Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements. Pursuant to these scaled requirements, emerging growth companies may:
 
Provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their IPO Registration Statement; 
 
Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required; 
 
Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and 
 
Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditor's attestation regarding the issuer's internal controls. 
 
OFFERING REQUIREMENTS
  In addition, during the IPO offering process, emerging growth companies are exempt from:
 
Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO; 
 
Certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the IPO registration statement; and 
 
The requirement initially to publicly file IPO Registration Statements. Emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft Registration Statements and any amendments with the SEC. Public filings of the draft documents must be made at least 21 days prior to commencement of the IPO "road show."
OTHER PUBLIC COMPANY REQUIREMENTS
 Emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:
 
The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation; 
 
Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and 

7 | Page



The requirements under Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. 
 

ELECTION UNDER SECTION 107(b) OF THE JOBS
 
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period that Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides an emerging growth company, as provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
PENNY STOCK RULES
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).
 
A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.
 
The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document, which:
 

In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.  These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities.
 
REGULATION M
 
Our officer and director, who will offer and sell the Shares, is aware that he is required to comply with the provisions of Regulation M promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes the officers and directors, sales agents, any broker-dealer or other person who participate in the distribution of shares in this offering from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete.
REPORTS
 
We are subject to certain reporting requirements and will furnish annual financial reports to our stockholders, certified by our independent accountants, and will furnish un-audited quarterly financial reports in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the SEC. All reports and information filed by us can be found at the SEC website, www.sec.gov.
