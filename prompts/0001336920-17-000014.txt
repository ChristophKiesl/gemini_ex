Item 1. Business
Our Company 
Leidos Holdings, Inc. ("Leidos") is a holding company whose direct 100%-owned subsidiaries and principal operating companies are Leidos, Inc. and Leidos Innovations Corporation ("Leidos Innovations"). Leidos was formed in 1969 by a small group of scientists led by physicist Dr. Robert Beyster. Since our founding 48 years ago, we have applied our expertise in science, research and engineering in rapidly evolving technologies and markets to solve complex problems of national concern. On August 16, 2016, Leidos acquired Lockheed Martin’s Information Systems & Global Solutions business (the "IS&GS Business") in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (see "Our Business Segments" for a description of the transaction and the IS&GS business).
Leidos is a global science and technology company that provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: command, control, computing, communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance ("C4ISR"); cybersecurity; systems engineering; large-scale agile software development; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; and operations and sustainment. Applying our technically advanced solutions to help solve our customers' most difficult problems has enabled us to build strong relationships with our key customers. Our domestic customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), the Department of Health and Human Services, other U.S. Government civil agencies and state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Australia. With a focus on delivering mission-critical solutions, Leidos generated 81% of our total revenues from U.S. Government contracts for fiscal 2016. 
Building on our foundation in offering innovative services and solutions to U.S. Government customers, Leidos is expanding into international government and broader commercial markets. By leveraging expertise in multiple disciplines, tailoring our services and solutions to the particular needs of our targeted markets and using advanced analytics, we work to securely deliver services and solutions that not only meet customers’ current goals, but also support their future endeavors. 
For additional discussion and analysis related to recent business developments, see “Business Environment and Trends” in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We use the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer collectively to Leidos Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
On March 20, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of the bylaws of Leidos to change Leidos' year end from the Friday nearest the end of January to the Friday nearest the end of December. As a result of this change, the Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period which began on January 31, 2015, and ended on January 1, 2016. This change did not impact the Company's prior reported fiscal years (each covering a 12-month period), each of which ended on the Friday closest to January 31. For example, fiscal 2015 began on February 1, 2014, and ended on January 30, 2015.
This Annual Report on Form 10-K is for fiscal 2016, which covers a 12-month period that began on January 2, 2016, and ended on December 30, 2016.

Key Customers
The majority of our revenues are generated in the United States. Our total revenues are largely attributable to prime contracts or to subcontracts with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. Government, with the remaining attributable to international customers, including the U.K. MoD, and customers across a variety of commercial markets. Within the U.S. Government, our revenues are diversified across many agencies, including various intelligence agencies, the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force, DHS, FAA, the Transportation Security Agency, the Defense Health Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA") and research agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"). 
The percentage of total revenues for the U.S. Government, its agencies and other customers comprising more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years for fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, were as follows:
 | 12 Months Ended | | 11 Months Ended | | 12 Months Ended 
 | December 30, 2016 | | January 1, 2016 | | January 30, 2015
U.S. Government | 81 | % | | 76 | % | 79 | %
U.S. DoD | 56 | % | | 64 | % | 67 | %
U.S. Army | 14 | % | | 14 | % | 16 | %
Maryland Procurement Office | 7 | % | | 10 | % | 10 | %

These customers have a number of subsidiary agencies that have separate budgets and procurement functions. Our contracts may be with the highest level of these agencies or with the subsidiary agencies of these customers.
Employees 
As part of our acquisition of the IS&GS Business, we gained approximately 15,000 additional employees. As of December 30, 2016, we employed approximately 32,000 full and part-time employees in 26 countries worldwide. The experience and expertise of our employees makes Leidos capable of solving our customers' most challenging technical problems. Approximately 42% of our employees have degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics fields, over 1,000 employees have doctoral degrees, nearly 40% of our employees possess security clearances and approximately 20% of our employees are military veterans. 
Research and Development 
We conduct research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded internal research and development ("IR&D") funds. IR&D efforts consist of projects involving basic research, applied research, development and systems and other concept formulation studies. IR&D expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to U.S. Government contracts. For fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, our company-funded IR&D expense was $44 million, $29 million and $37 million, respectively, which as a percentage of sales was 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. We charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets, using non-disclosure agreements, contracts and other definitive agreements. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties.
In connection with the performance of services and solutions, the U.S. Government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. Government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. Government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations.

PART I

Competition
Competition for contracts is intense, and we often compete against a large number of established multinational corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, as well as the U.S. Government’s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. Government and our commercial customers, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations. We believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies:

• | the engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors that provide U.S. Government IT services in addition to other hardware systems and products, including companies such as The Boeing Company, General Dynamics Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, BAE Systems plc, L-3 Communications Corporation and Raytheon Company;


• | contractors focused principally on technical services, including U.S. Government IT services, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., Engility Holdings, Inc., CACI International Inc., ManTech International Corporation, SAIC, Vencore and KeyW;


• | diversified commercial and U.S. Government IT providers, such as Accenture plc, CSRA, Inc., HP Enterprise Services, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Dell, Amazon Web Services, AT&T, RSA, Verizon and Unisys Corporation;


• | contractors focused on supplying homeland security product solutions, including OSI Systems, Inc., L-3 Communications Corporation, Morpho (Safran) and Smiths Group plc;


• | contractors providing supply chain management and other logistics services, including Agility Logistics Corp., PAE and Vectrus; and


• | companies focused on providing health solutions and services to the U.S. Government and hospitals, including Accenture plc, IBM, CSRA, Inc., LHI, Maximus, Epic Systems and Medical Information Technology, Inc. ("Meditech").

We compete on various factors, including our technical expertise and qualified professional and/or security-cleared personnel; our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner; successful program execution; our reputation and standing with customers; pricing; and the size and geographic presence of our company.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it intends to increase competition for future procurement of products and services, which has led to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on cost-competitiveness and affordability. The U.S. Government is also committed to maintaining a socioeconomically diverse base of suppliers, which may lead to contracts being set aside for smaller businesses. In addition, procurement initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole, which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.
Contract Procurement 
Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other contracts. The U.S. Government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Today, U.S. Government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. Government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. Government agencies procure services and products include the following:
Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 7

PART I


• | Definitive Award Contracts. U.S. Government agencies may procure services and products through single definitive award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products. When an agency has a requirement, the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal. The bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. For the contractor, this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single definitive successful awardee.


• | Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts. The U.S. Government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. Government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single-award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-established contractor. Under a multiple-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-established contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multiple-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as “government-wide acquisition contracts.” IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, therefore enabling, but not committing, the U.S. Government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the award of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract, and in the case of a multiple-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.


• | U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreed-upon prices for use throughout the U.S. Government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule contract to meet its requirements, the agency, or the GSA on behalf of the agency, conducts the procurement. The user agency, or the GSA on its behalf, evaluates the user agency’s requirements and initiates a competition limited to GSA Schedule qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract.

We often partner with other companies, including our competitors, to submit bids for large U.S. Government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract. Our relationships with our partners, including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program, contract or customer requirements, as well as the relative size, qualifications, capabilities, customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners.
Contracting with the U.S. Government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. Government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the U.S. Government issues a termination for convenience. These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under “Business–Regulation” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 8

PART I

Contract Types 
Generally, the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. Government and may depend on certain factors, including the type and complexity of the work to be performed, degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following:

• | Cost-reimbursement contracts include cost-plus-fixed-fee, award-fee and incentive-fee contracts. These contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee. These contracts are generally used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk but generally require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget. Award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company's performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.


• | Fixed-price-incentive fee (“FP-IF”) contracts are substantially similar to cost plus incentive fee contracts except they require specified targets for cost and profit, price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor) and profit adjustment formula. Under a FP-IF contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a cost-share arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated.


• | Time-and-materials ("T&M") contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty about the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts.


• | Fixed-price-level-of-effort ("FP-LOE") contracts are substantially similar to T&M contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms. This type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing the results achieved based on the level of effort. Payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved.


• | Firm-fixed-price ("FFP") contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. This type of contract is generally used when the government acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications and which have a determinable fair and reasonable price. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns.

Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or products provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts.

Backlog 
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog, each of which are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog from U.S. Government customers as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. Government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. In addition, certain contracts with commercial or non-U.S. Federal Government customers included in funded backlog may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time. Many of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. For additional discussion and analysis of backlog, see "Results of Operations—Bookings and Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality 
The U.S. Government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. Government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. We tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season. For selected quarterly financial data, see "Note 22–Selected Quarterly Financial Data" of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulation 
We are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate. We provide services and products to numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including to the DoD, the U.S. Intelligence Community and the DHS. When working with these and other U.S. Government agencies and entities, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. U.S. Government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. Government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement ("DFARS") and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements. Among other things, these laws and regulations:

• | require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;


• | define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. Government contracts;


• | require compliance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS");


• | require reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA") and other U.S. Government agencies of compliance with government requirements for a contractor’s business systems;


• | restrict the use and dissemination of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and


• | require us not to compete for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated, neutralized or avoided.

The U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position.
