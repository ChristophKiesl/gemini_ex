Item 1.    Business
Overview of Our Company and Business Strategy
We are the leader and innovator in total talent solutions for the healthcare sector in the United States. We are passionate about all aspects of our mission to:
•Deliver the right talent and insights to help healthcare organizations optimize their workforce.
•Provide healthcare professionals opportunities to do their best work toward high-quality patient care.
•Create a values-based culture of innovation in which our team members can achieve their goals. 
Our solutions enable our clients to optimize their workforce, simplify staffing complexity, increase efficiency and elevate the patient experience. Our comprehensive suite of talent solutions provides management, staffing, recruitment, technology, analytics, and related services to build and manage all or part of our clients’ healthcare workforce needs. We offer temporary, project, and permanent career opportunities to our healthcare professionals, from nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals to healthcare leaders and executives in a variety of clinical settings across the nation to help them achieve their personal and professional goals.
Our strategy is designed to support growth in the number and size of customer relationships and expansion of the markets we serve. Driving increased adoption of our existing talent solutions through cross-selling will deepen and broaden our customer relationships. We will continue to innovate, develop and invest in new, complementary solutions to our portfolio that optimize our clients’ workforce and better engage our talent network. We expect this will help us expand our strategic customer relationships to help clients address their workforce pain points, while driving more recurring revenue, with an improved margin mix that, similar to our leadership in managed services programs (“MSP”), will be less sensitive to economic cycles.

Over the past decade, our business has evolved beyond traditional healthcare staffing and recruitment services; we have become a strategic total talent solutions partner with our clients. We expanded our portfolio to serve a diverse and growing set of healthcare talent-related needs. In addition to our healthcare professional staffing and recruitment services, our suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems (“VMS”), medical language interpretation services, predictive labor analytics, workforce optimization technology and consulting, clinical labor scheduling, recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”), revenue cycle solutions, and credentialing software services. We enable clients to build and optimize their healthcare talent to deliver great patient outcomes and experience. Our talent network includes thousands of highly skilled, experienced professionals who trust us to place them in environments that expand and leverage their qualifications and expertise.
When developing and acquiring talent solutions, both services and technology, we consider many important criteria: (1) identifying and addressing the most pressing current and future needs of our clients and talent network; (2) alignment with our core operations, expertise, and access to healthcare professionals; (3) ways to deepen and broaden our client and healthcare professional relationships; (4) talent and technology solutions that expand the markets we serve; (5) businesses that reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles; and (6) offerings that differentiate us from competitors. 
Continuous improvement of our operations and business technology is a core component of our growth strategy and profitability goals. We have accelerated the integration of technology-based solutions in our core recruitment processes through targeted investment in digital capabilities, mobile applications and data analytics. These innovations provide a more seamless and efficient workflow for our team members, our healthcare professionals and our clients. Our investments in technology systems will help us realize greater scale, agility, and cost efficiencies.
Human Capital Management

Providing total talent solutions to our clients is our primary source of revenue generation, so development of a broad base of healthcare professionals and corporate team members who are valued, respected and supported is essential to drive shareholder value and achieve our long-term growth objectives. To support these objectives, our human capital management strategy generally focuses on talent recruitment, engagement and retention, diversity, equality and inclusion, and employee health and safety. The central components of our human capital management strategy and infrastructure are described in more detail in this section below. 
The strength of our human capital management infrastructure and strategy was also instrumental to our COVID-19 response in 2020. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the Company and its teams worked quickly to assess the impact of the pandemic on our team members, healthcare professionals, communities, clients and their patients and took immediate action to mitigate the risks to all stakeholders. Throughout the pandemic, caring for the well-being of our team members and healthcare professionals has been a primary focus. We are working hard every day to ensure that all of our team members and healthcare professionals have the resources available to help them navigate the continued challenges and stresses associated with the pandemic.
The care, support and safety of our frontline healthcare professionals was and remains at the forefront for us. We have provided our healthcare professionals with additional support from our corporate clinical staff, third party vendors providing mental health resources, sick pay while quarantined and other products and services to show our appreciation for them.
We quickly and effectively moved our roughly 3,000 corporate team members to a fully remote work environment in March 2020 and our offices remain closed. Our team members have continued to support our clients and healthcare professionals with the highest level of service from their home offices without a disruption in our business operations. We have provided our team members with stipends and other resources in 2020 and 2021 to establish their new working environments.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,000 corporate team members, which includes both full-time and part-time. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we had an average of (1) 10,084 nurses, allied and other healthcare professionals, (2) 314 executive and clinical leadership interim staff, and (3) 1,239 medically qualified interpreters working for us. This does not include independent contractors, such as our locum tenens and contract interpreters, who were not our employees in 2020.
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion

At AMN, our diversity, equality and inclusion philosophy is grounded in the belief that we should respect all voices, seek diverse perspectives, and succeed when we act together as a positive force for all of humanity. We have the opportunity to make an impact on each other, our industry, and other communities by fostering a diverse team with a passion for social justice and equity. We are committed to actively engaging in building an organization and society where equality is the norm, equity is achieved, and inclusion is universal so that we may all thrive.
We believe that our diverse workforce, and inclusive environment drives the innovation and better outcomes that have made us the leader in total talent solutions. While the diverse backgrounds and experiences we seek are broad, here is a snapshot of some of the diversity of our team as of January 2021: 65% of our team members are women; 64% of our supervisor 

through senior manager roles are held by women; 56% of our board of directors are women; 32% of our team members are non white; our team is 57% Millennials, 34% Generation X, 8% Baby Boomers, and less than 1% other generations; and team members self-identified as veterans, disabled, and LGBTQ+, each represent approximately 2% of our team. In 2019 and 2020, AMN was named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. AMN also received a top ranking – 95 out of 100 – in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index. We believe that our robust human capital management infrastructure and commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion is fundamental to our continued recognition as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies in 2020 and 2021. In addition, the Women’s Forum of New York and 2020 Women on Board recently recognized us for advancing gender parity in the boardroom.
Team Member Engagement

To assess the engagement of our team members and take action to mitigate risks associated with workforce engagement, development and retention, we conduct an annual survey to assess the engagement of our team members. While the format of our annual survey varies from year to year to best capture different measures of employee engagement, the results of each assessment are discussed with our board of directors, and is incorporated into our annual human capital management strategic planning process. In 2019, our overall employee engagement was measured at 80%. We did not conduct an annual engagement survey in 2020 due to the disruptions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Spring of 2020, we surveyed our team members to see how they were doing in the new environment and also solicited feedback on how they thought the Company was handling the pandemic. We were pleased with the results, with the team members providing high marks noting that the Company placed their safety as paramount and was very transparent in communications about the current situations and the evolving future.
In addition, during 2020, we focused our attention and efforts on increasing engagement through our growing number of employee resource groups. Best practice research indicates that team member engagement and retention is positively impacted if team members are connected to like-minded peers and leaders. To build an inclusive infrastructure of employee resource groups that closely aligns with the diverse interests and backgrounds of our team members, we believe we have invested into and dedicated the necessary resources. As of December 31, 2020, we actively supported seven employee resource groups and approximately 30% of our corporate team members are members of a resource group. Each of our employee resource groups is sponsored by members of our executive team.
Our Services

In 2020, we conducted our business through three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) physician and leadership solutions and (3) technology and workforce solutions. We describe each segment’s revenue and operating results under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare clients with a wide range of workforce solutions and staffing services as set forth below. 

(1) Travel Nurse Staffing. We provide clients with nurses, most of them registered nurses, to work temporary assignments under our flagship brand, American Mobile, as well as under our Onward Healthcare brand. Assignments in acute-care hospitals, including teaching institutions, trauma centers and community hospitals, comprise the majority of our assignments. The length of the assignment varies with a typical travel nurse assignment of 13 weeks. Under our O’Grady Peyton brand, we also recruit nurses internationally from English speaking countries who immigrate to the United States under a permanent resident visa (Green Card) and who typically work for us for a period of 24 months.
(2)Rapid Response Nurse Staffing and Labor Disruption Services. We provide a shorter-term staffing solution of typically up to eight weeks under our NurseChoice and HealthSource Global Staffing brands to address hospitals’ urgent need for registered nurses. NurseChoice and HealthSource Global Staffing recruit and place nurses who can begin assignments within one to two weeks in contrast to the three to five week lead time that may be required for travel nurses. We also provide labor disruption services for clients involved in strikes of nurses and allied professional staff through our HealthSource Global Staffing brand.
(3)Local, or Per Diem, Staffing. Through our Nursefinders brand, we provide our clients local staffing, often in support of our MSP clients. Local staffing involves the placement of locally-based healthcare professionals on daily shift work on an as-needed basis. Hospitals and healthcare facilities often give only a few hours’ notice of their local staffing assignments that require a turnaround from their staffing agencies of generally less than 24 hours. 
(4)Locum Tenens Staffing. We place physicians of all specialties, advanced practice clinicians and dentists on an independent contractor basis on temporary assignments with all types of healthcare organizations throughout the United States, including hospitals, health systems, medical groups, occupational medical clinics, psychiatric 

facilities, government institutions and insurance companies. We recruit these professionals nationwide and typically place them on assignment lengths ranging from a few days up to one year. We market these services through our Staff Care and Locum Leaders brands.
(5)Allied Staffing. We provide allied health professionals under the Med Travelers and Club Staffing brands to acute-care hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation clinics, schools, and retail and mail-order pharmacies. Allied health professionals include such disciplines as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, medical and radiology technologists, lab technicians, speech pathologists, rehabilitation assistants and pharmacists.
(6)Revenue Cycle Solutions. Our AMN Revenue Cycle Solutions brand provides skilled labor solutions for remote medical coding, clinical documentation improvement, case management, and clinical data registry, and also provides auditing and advisory services. Clients include hospitals and physician medical groups nationwide.
(7)Physician Permanent Placement Services. We provide retained search, physician permanent placement services to hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician practice groups throughout the United States through our Merritt Hawkins brand. 
(8)Interim Leadership Staffing and Executive Search Services. Under the brand name B.E. Smith, we provide executive and clinical leadership interim staffing, healthcare executive search services and advisory services. Practice areas include senior healthcare executives, physician executives, chief nursing officers and other clinical and operational leaders. We also provide physician executive leadership search services focused on serving academic medical centers and children’s hospitals nationwide. This business line provides us greater access to the “C-suite” of our clients and prospective clients, which we believe helps improve our visibility as a strategic partner to them and helps provide us with cross-selling opportunities.
(9)Recruitment Process Outsourcing. We offer our clients RPO services, customized to their particular needs, in which we recruit, hire and/or onboard permanent clinical and nonclinical positions on behalf of the client. Our RPO program leverages our expertise and support systems to replace or complement a client’s existing internal recruitment functions for permanent hiring needs, providing cost-effective flexibility to our clients to determine how to best obtain and use recruiting resources.
(10)Managed Services Programs. Many of our clients and prospective clients use a number of healthcare staffing agencies to fulfill their healthcare professional needs. We offer a comprehensive managed services program, in which we manage all or a portion of a client’s staffing needs. This service includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the client’s staffing needs. We believe an MSP increases efficiencies and cost savings for our clients and facilities staffing optimization. We often use our own VMS technology as part of our MSP, which we believe further enhances the value of our service offering. In 2020, we had approximately $1.7 billion in annualized gross billings under management under our MSPs and approximately 50% of our consolidated revenue flowed through MSP relationships, which has steadily increased over the past decade.
(11)Language Interpretation Services. Through our acquisition of Stratus Video, our AMN Language Services division provides healthcare interpretation services via remote video, over the phone, and onsite in-person. These services are all supported by proprietary technology platforms, which enable real-time routing of video and audio calls, drive client efficiency with an in-person scheduling mobile application, and power interoperability with multiple telehealth platforms.
(12)Vendor Management Systems. Some clients and prospective clients prefer a vendor-neutral VMS technology that allows them to self-manage procurement of contingent clinical labor and their internal float pool. We provide three software as a service (“SaaS”)-based VMS technologies, ShiftWise, Medefis and b4health, to clients that desire this option. Our VMS technologies provide, among other things, control over a wide variety of tasks via a single system and consolidated reporting. In 2020, we had approximately $1.9 billion in annualized gross billings flow through our VMS programs.
(13)Workforce Optimization Services. We provide workforce optimization services, including consulting, data analytics, predictive labor demand modeling and SaaS-delivered scheduling technology. Our Avantas business provides proprietary scheduling software, Smart Square, that uses predictive analytics to create better, more accurate and timely staffing plans for a client, which has been demonstrated to reduce a client’s clinical labor spend.
(14)Credentialing Services. Through our acquisition of Silversheet, we provide innovative credentialing software solutions to clinicians and healthcare enterprises. Silversheet’s products help reduce the complexity and challenges of the clinician credentialing process, enhance our clients’ ability to provide safe, effective, and high-quality medical care for patients, and greatly improve the clinician experience.

(15)Digital Staffing. Through investment in new technologies, we are streamlining the match of the right clinicians to the right assignment to meet the on-demand needs of our clients. The AMN Passport and AMN hub mobile applications allow nurses and allied professionals to quickly search hundreds of jobs, book assignments that match their qualifications and availability, and receive instantaneous alerts and updates, helping our clients quickly fill workforce gaps.
(16)Flex Pool Management. We offer an innovative and comprehensive workforce solution that provides technology and services to build and manage dedicated resource pools. This regional workforce model utilizes standardized processes, integrated systems, and advanced scheduling technology to mobilize clinicians and meet the growing demand of our MSP clients.
We typically experience modest seasonal fluctuations during our fiscal year and they tend to vary among our business segments. These fluctuations can vary slightly in intensity from year to year. Over the past five years, these seasonal fluctuations have been muted in our consolidated results.
Our Healthcare Professionals

The recruitment of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work on temporary assignments and for placement at healthcare organizations is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position.
We recruit our healthcare professionals, depending on the particular service line, under the following brands: American Mobile, Nursefinders, NurseChoice, HealthSource Global Staffing, Onward Healthcare, O’Grady Peyton International, Med Travelers, Club Staffing, Staff Care, Locum Leaders, B.E. Smith, Merritt Hawkins, and AMN Revenue Cycle Solutions. Our multi-brand recruiting strategy is supported by innovative and effective marketing programs that focus on lead management, including our digital presence on websites, social media, and mobile applications. Word-of-mouth referrals from the thousands of current and former healthcare professionals we have placed enhance our effectiveness at reaching healthcare professionals.
Our process to attract and retain healthcare professionals for temporary assignments and permanent placement depends on (1) offering a large selection of assignments and placements in a variety of geographies and settings with opportunities for career development, (2) creating attractive compensation packages, (3) developing passionate, knowledgeable recruiters and service professionals who understand the needs of our healthcare professionals and provide a personalized approach, and (4) maintaining a reputation for service excellence. The attractive compensation package that we provide our temporary healthcare professionals includes a competitive wage, professional development opportunities, professional liability insurance, 401(k) plan and health insurance.
Our Geographic Markets and Client Base

During each of the past three years, (1) we generated substantially all of our revenue in the United States and (2) substantially all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. We typically generate revenue in all 50 states. During 2020, the largest percentages of our revenue were concentrated in California, Texas and New York. 
More than half of our temporary and contract healthcare professional assignments occur at acute-care hospitals. In addition to acute-care hospitals, we provide services to sub-acute healthcare facilities, physician groups, rehabilitation centers, schools, home health service providers and ambulatory surgery centers. Our clients, many of the largest and most prestigious and progressive health care systems in the country. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (and its affiliates), to whom we provide clinical managed services, comprised approximately 14% of our consolidated revenue and 17% of our nurse and allied solutions segment’s revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. No other client healthcare system or single client facility comprised more than 5% of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Our Industry

The primary markets in which we compete are U.S. temporary and contract healthcare staffing, workforce solutions and executive search. Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) estimates that the segments of the healthcare staffing markets of travel nurse, per diem nurse, locum tenens and allied healthcare have an aggregate 2020 estimated market size of $17.3 billion, comprising $6.7 billion, $3.5 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. We also operate within the interim leadership, executive search, physician permanent placement, RPO, VMS, revenue cycle solutions, and workforce optimization and consulting services markets. We estimate the size of these additional markets to be at least $5.0 billion in 2020.
Industry Demand Drivers

Many factors affect the demand for contingent and permanent healthcare talent, which, accordingly, affects the size of the markets in which we primarily operate. Of these many factors, we believe the following serve as some of the most significant drivers of demand.

•Economic Environment and Employment Rate. Demand for our services is affected by growth of the U.S. economy, which influences the employment rate. Growth in real U.S. gross domestic product generally drives rising employment rates. Favorable macro drivers typically result in increased demand for our services. Generally, we believe a positive economic environment and growing employment lead to increasing demand for healthcare services. As employment levels rise, healthcare facilities, like employers in many industries, experience higher levels of employee attrition and find it increasingly difficult to obtain and retain permanent staff.
•Supply of Healthcare Professionals. While reports differ on the existence and extent of current and future healthcare professional shortages, many regions of the United States are experiencing a shortage of physicians and nurses that we believe will persist in the future. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the physician shortage is expected to range from 46,900 to 121,900 physicians by 2032. In nursing, geographic and specialty-based shortages are also expected through 2030, and we believe have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for our services is positively correlated with activity in the permanent labor market. When nurse vacancy rates increase, temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase as well.
•General Demand for Healthcare Services. Changes in demand for healthcare services, particularly at acute healthcare hospitals and other inpatient facilities, like skilled nursing facilities, affect the demand for our services. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured population declined by more than 18 million people between 2010 and 2018. Growth of the insured population contributed to a relatively sharp increase in national healthcare expenditures beginning in 2014. Additionally, the U.S. population continues to age, and medical technology advances are contributing to longer life expectancy. A pronounced shift in U.S. age demographics is expected to boost growth of health expenditures, projected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at a 5.4% annual rate from 2019-2028. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of adults age 65 or older is on pace to grow an estimated 80% between 2020 and 2030. People over 65 are three times more likely to have a hospital stay and twice as likely to visit a physician office compared with the rest of the population. These dynamics could place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide in the coming years. Not only does the age-demographic shift affect healthcare services demand, it also complicates the supply of skilled labor, as an increasing number of clinicians are aging out of the workforce.
•Adoption of Workforce Solutions. We believe healthcare organizations increasingly seek sophisticated, innovative and economically beneficial total talent solutions that improve patient outcomes. We believe the prevalence of workforce solutions, such as MSP, VMS, RPO and workforce optimization tools, in the healthcare industry is still underpenetrated in comparison with non-healthcare sectors. During 2020, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were generated through MSP relationships, which we estimate is higher than our competitors. The talent shortage and significance of clinical labor in healthcare facilities’ cost structures may accelerate the adoption of strategic outsourced workforce solutions, which could place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide.


Industry Competition
The healthcare staffing and workforce solutions industry is highly competitive. We compete in national, regional and local markets for healthcare organization clients and healthcare professionals. We believe that our comprehensive suite of total talent solutions, our commitment to quality and service excellence, our execution capabilities, and our national footprint create a compelling value proposition for our existing and prospective clients that give us distinct, scalable advantages over smaller, local and regional competitors and companies whose solution offerings, sales and execution capabilities are not as robust. The breadth of our talent solutions allows us to provide even greater value through a more strategic and consultative approach to our clients. In addition, we believe that our size, scale and sophisticated candidate acquisition processes give us access to a larger pool of available, high quality candidates than most of our competitors, while substantial word-of-mouth referral networks and recognizable brand names enable us to attract, engage, and grow a diverse, high-quality network of healthcare professionals.
Larger firms, such as us, also generally have a deeper, more comprehensive infrastructure with a more established operating model and processes that provide the long-term stability and foundation for quality standards recognition, such as the Joint Commission staffing agency certification and National Committee for Quality Assurance Credentials Verification Organization certification. HRO Today named AMN Healthcare the number one position among all MSP providers in size of deals, and we also were honored in the Baker’s Dozen for quality of services, breadth of services and overall MSP capabilities. Once again, in 2020, Staffing Industry Analysts recognized AMN’s U.S. industry leadership naming us as the largest temporary healthcare staffing firm, the largest travel nurse staffing provider and the largest allied healthcare staffing provider.
We are the largest provider of nurse and allied healthcare staffing in the United States. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, we compete with a few national competitors together with numerous smaller, regional and local companies. We believe we are the third largest provider of locum tenens staffing services in the United States. The locum tenens staffing market consists of many small- to mid-sized companies with only a relatively small number of national competitors of which we are one. The healthcare interim leadership staffing, healthcare executive search services, and physician permanent placement services markets, where we believe we hold leading positions, are also highly fragmented and consist of many small- to mid-sized companies that do not have a national footprint. We also believe we have a market-leading share in managed services solutions, including VMS and MSP, and healthcare language interpretation services, which is the fastest growing market segment, after our acquisition of Stratus Video. Our leading competitors vary by segment and include CHG Healthcare Services, Jackson Healthcare, Medical Solutions, RightSourcing, Cross Country Healthcare, Aya Healthcare, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, and WittKieffer. When recruiting for healthcare professionals, in addition to other executive search and staffing firms, we also compete with hospital systems that have developed their own recruitment departments.
Licensure For Our Business

Some states require state licensure for businesses that employ, assign and/or place healthcare professionals. We believe we are currently licensed in all states that require such licenses and take measures to ensure compliance with all state licensure requirements. In addition, the healthcare professionals who we employ or independently contract with are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state laws. We believe we take appropriate and reasonable steps to validate that our healthcare professionals possess all necessary licenses and certifications. We design our internal processes to ensure that the healthcare professionals that we directly place with clients have the appropriate experience, credentials and skills. Our nurse, allied healthcare and locum tenens staffing divisions have received Joint Commission certification. We have also obtained our Credentials Verification Organization certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance.
Government Regulation

We are subject to the laws of the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
