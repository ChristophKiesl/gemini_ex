Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Aspen Aerogels, Inc. is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets. The Company also conducts research and development related to aerogel technology supported by funding from several agencies of the U.S. government and other institutions in the form of research and development contracts.  When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Aspen Aerogels, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We design, develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver the best thermal performance of any widely used insulation product available on the market today and provide a combination of performance attributes unmatched by traditional insulation materials. Our products provide two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. Our end-use customers select our products where thermal performance is critical, and to save money, reduce energy use, preserve operating assets and protect workers.
 Our technologically advanced products are targeted at the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our aerogel insulation has undergone rigorous technical validation and is used by many of the world’s largest oil producers and the owners and operators of refineries, petrochemical plants, LNG facilities and power generating assets, such as ExxonMobil, Pemex Gas and Royal Dutch Shell. Our products replace traditional insulation in existing facilities during regular maintenance, upgrades and capacity expansions. In addition, we are increasingly being specified for use in new-build energy infrastructure facilities.
 We introduced our two key product lines, Pyrogel and Cryogel in 2008. Our product revenue has grown from $17.2 million in 2008 to $115.5 million in 2016, representing an eight year compound annual growth rate of 27%. During this period, we have sold more than $600 million of our products globally, representing an installed base of more than 240 million square feet of insulation. We believe that this initial success positions us for future growth and continued gain in market share.
 We currently target our sales efforts in the energy infrastructure market, where we believe our products have the highest value applications. We continue to develop and optimize aerogel products for applications within the building materials market. As we continue to enhance our technology, we believe we will have opportunities to address additional high value applications in the global insulation market.
 We have grown our business by forming technical and commercial relationships with industry leaders, which has allowed us to optimize our products to meet the particular demands of targeted market sectors. We have benefited from our technical and commercial relationships with ExxonMobil in the oil refinery and petrochemical sector, with TechnipFMC in the offshore oil sector and with BASF in the building materials market. We will continue our strategy of working with innovative companies to target and penetrate additional market opportunities.
 Our patented aerogel product and manufacturing technologies are significant assets. Aerogels are complex structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. These extremely low density solids provide superior insulating properties. Although aerogels are usually fragile materials, we have developed innovative and proprietary manufacturing processes that enable us to produce industrially robust aerogel insulation cost-effectively and at commercial scale.
 Our products enable compact design, reduce installation time and costs, promote freight and logistics cost savings, reduce system weight and required storage space and enhance job site safety. Our products reduce the incidence of corrosion under insulation, which is a significant maintenance cost and safety issue in energy infrastructure facilities. Our products also offer strong fire protection, which is a critical performance requirement in our markets. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation products.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, based on shipment destination or research services location, our U.S. revenues were $35.7 million, $44.5 million and $39.8 million, respectively, and our international revenues were $82.0 million, $78.0 million and $62.6 million, respectively.

 We manufacture our products using proprietary technology at our facility in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. We successfully commenced operation of our third production line in the East Providence facility in 2015 which increased our annual

nameplate capacity to approximately 50 million square feet of aerogel blankets. During 2015, we announced the planned construction of a second manufacturing facility in Statesboro, Georgia.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we elected to temporarily delay construction of this second facility to better align the capacity expansion with our assessment of demand for the 2018 to 2020 period.
 Financial information about our product and research services revenues, net loss per share and our total assets are provided in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets and Competition
 Our core market is the energy infrastructure insulation market. This market is global, well-established and includes large and well-capitalized end-users. This market includes companies operating refinery, petrochemical, oil production, LNG production and storage facilities. The market also includes firms operating gas, coal, nuclear, hydro and solar thermal power generating plants and district energy systems. Insulation systems in the energy infrastructure market are designed to maintain hot and cold process piping and storage tanks at optimal temperatures, to protect plant and equipment from the elements and from the risk of fire, and to protect workers. The market is served by a well-organized, well-established, worldwide network of distributors, contractors and engineers.
 Demand for insulation in the energy infrastructure market is composed of demand associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, as well as with routine, non-discretionary maintenance programs within existing facilities. Capital expansions and related capital projects in the energy infrastructure market are driven primarily by overall economic growth and projected growth in energy demand. Maintenance programs are essential to optimal operation of processing equipment, to protect workers and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic loss. Accordingly, we believe that demand for insulation for maintenance purposes in comparison to capital projects is less affected by volatility associated with economic cycles, energy prices and similar macroeconomic factors.
 The major end-use markets that drive demand for our products include oil refining, petrochemical, natural gas and LNG, onshore oil production (including oil sands), offshore oil production and power generation. Global energy demand is expected to increase in the long-term and, in order to serve this growing demand, we believe our end-use customers will continue to invest in major energy infrastructure projects.
 We also sell our products in the building materials and other end markets, including the supply of fabricated insulation parts to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. These global OEMs develop products incorporating our aerogel blankets for applications as diverse as military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. While these are not presently our core markets, we anticipate that we will allocate a growing portion of our manufacturing capacity to serve these markets in the long term. We believe the key performance criteria for insulation in these markets includes thermal performance, compact design, durability and fire resistance.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. In general, we compete with traditional insulation materials based on product performance, price, availability and proximity to the customer. Customers may choose among a variety of traditional insulation materials that offer a range of characteristics including thermal performance, durability, vapor permeability, moisture resistance, ease of installation and upfront and lifecycle costs. Within each type of insulation material, there is also competition between the manufacturers of that material. Most types of traditional insulation materials are produced by a number of different manufacturers and once customers have chosen the type of insulation material that they intend to use, they will choose a manufacturer of that material based primarily on each manufacturer’s price and delivery schedule. Insulation manufacturers include a range of large, high-volume, multinational manufacturers offering branded products and strong technical support services to small, low-volume, local manufacturers offering low prices and limited customer support.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in our market are:
  
• | product performance (along multiple criteria), quality and fitness for purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product price, installed cost and lifecycle cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | product availability; and
--+--------------------------


• | proximity to customer and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------

 Our products are priced at a premium to traditional insulation materials. While our competitors offer many traditional insulation products that are priced below our products on a per-unit basis, we believe our products have superior performance attributes and have the lowest cost on a fully-installed basis or offer significant life-cycle cost savings.

We compete in the aerogel insulation market with Cabot Corporation, or Cabot, and competitors in China, including Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. and Nano Tech Co., Ltd., which manufacture and sell aerogel insulation products.
 Within each of our target markets, we encounter one or more of these organizations or their resellers and a significant number of other aggressive national, regional and local suppliers of traditional insulation products. Our competitors are seeking to enhance traditional insulation materials and to develop and introduce new and emerging insulation technologies. Competing technologies that outperform our insulation products in one or more performance attributes could be developed and successfully introduced. See “Risk Factors — The energy infrastructure insulation market is highly competitive; if we are unable to compete successfully, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share and revenues.”
 Our market share in 2016 was less than 4% of the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Many of our competitors have greater market presence, larger market share, longer operating histories, stronger name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand volatility within the industry and throughout the economy as a whole while retaining greater operating and financial flexibility. If our competitors lower their prices, or develop new products with better performance, or if we are unable to compete effectively, our growth opportunities, share of the market, margins and profitability may decline.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Because insulation is used in a wide variety of demanding applications, insulation materials must satisfy a wide range of performance criteria on a cost-effective basis. We believe that our aerogel technology has allowed us to create superior insulation products for our core markets that will allow us to continue to grow our share of the global insulation market. We believe that the potential for significant technological innovation in traditional insulation materials is limited and that new high-performance materials will be required to meet evolving market requirements for energy efficient insulation systems. Our line of high-performance aerogel blankets is positioned to meet these requirements. Our solution is driven by our innovative and proprietary technology that produces aerogels in a flexible and industrially robust blanket form and is supported by over 15 years of research and development dedicated to new aerogel compositions, form factors and manufacturing technologies. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver a superior combination of performance attributes that enable end-users to save money, reduce energy use, preserve operating assets and protect workers across a wide range of applications in our target markets.
 We believe the following combination of capabilities distinguishes us from our competitors and positions us to continue to gain market share in the energy infrastructure insulation market:
  
• | Disruptive Products with a Compelling Value Proposition. Our aerogel products provide two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation and will enable us to gain a larger share of the energy infrastructure insulation market. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation.

Our Growth Strategy
 We are targeting continued expansion of the use of our products within energy infrastructure facilities during regular maintenance, upgrades and expansions. In addition to opportunities to replace traditional insulation at existing facilities, we are also pursuing insulation applications at new-build and large capacity expansion projects around the world. 
 Our strategy is to create economic value by leveraging our technological and market leadership in aerogels to be the premier provider of high-performance insulation products serving global energy infrastructure customers. We also will pursue high-value opportunities for our aerogel products within other segments of the global insulation market, including the building materials market. In addition, we will leverage our aerogel technology platform to develop innovative, aerogel enhanced products for applications outside the global insulation market. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Broaden Energy Market Diversity and Grow Market Share. We plan to focus additional resources to continue to grow our share of the energy infrastructure insulation market, both through increased sales to our existing customers and through sales to new customers. We plan to continue to expand our global sales force and distribution network and seek to promote greater enterprise-wide utilization of our products by existing end-use customers. To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated from applications in refineries and petrochemical facilities. We will continue to pursue and expect greater adoption of our products in district heating systems, LNG production and storage, and power generation markets. In addition, our product revenue has been and will be generated in large part by demand for insulation associated with scheduled plant shutdowns, or turnarounds, and other maintenance-related projects. With our broad adoption and growing installed base, we expect that our products will be specified during the design phase in a growing number of new plant construction and capital expansion projects. We expect that growth in global energy demand over time will result in increased new-build and large capacity expansion projects, driving demand for our aerogel products.

Our Products
 Aerogels are highly porous structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. Aerogels are a very low density solid and are usually extremely fragile materials. However, our proprietary manufacturing process produces aerogels in a flexible, resilient, durable and easy-to-use blanket form.
 The core raw material in the production of our aerogel products is a silica precursor. Our manufacturing process initially creates a semi-solid alcogel in which the silica structure is filled with ethanol. We produce aerogel by means of a supercritical extraction process that removes ethanol from the gel and replaces it with air. Our process allows the liquid ethanol to be extracted without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary forces.
 Our material costs were 41%, 45% and 46% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are seeking to lower our manufacturing costs and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our chemistries and manufacturing processes to improve yields, by obtaining material price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors for certain materials and by reducing shipping costs. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantage and to ensure we deliver high quality finished products.
 The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of polyester and fiberglass battings, silica precursor and ethanol, which is used in the delivery of the silica precursor. Multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials, and we believe the markets for these products are competitive and prices are relatively stable. We purchase silica precursor from several suppliers. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursor is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursor will be available. Suppliers of silica precursor include industrial companies that produce it directly or that produce it as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop processes to reduce the long-term cost of the silica precursor used in our products. See “Risk Factors — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Our aerogel blankets are reinforced with non-woven fiber batting. We manufacture and sell our blankets in 60 inch wide, three foot diameter rolls with a standard range of thickness of 5 millimeters to 10 millimeters. Our base products are all flexible, hydrophobic, vapor permeable, compression resistant and able to be cut with conventional tools. We have specifically developed our line of aerogel blankets to meet the requirements of a broad set of applications within our target markets. The composition and attributes of our aerogel blankets are described below:
 Energy Infrastructure Markets

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 R-Values by Material
 Insulation is a material or combination of materials that slows the transfer of heat from one side of the material to the other. The composition of our aerogel products minimizes the three mechanisms of thermal transport:
  
• | Conduction. Heat conduction through a material is correlated to the material’s density. Aerogels are very low density solids. As a result, thermal conductivity through the aerogel material itself is extremely low.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convection. Heat convection in gases is through movement of gas molecules. Due to the restricted movement of gases in the aerogel structure, thermal convection is eliminated inside the aerogels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Radiation. Radiation requires no medium to transfer the heat. Thermal radiation is partially absorbed by aerogels. Our aerogel products also contain infrared absorbing additives to significantly reduce radiant heat transfer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our aerogel products offer the lowest levels of thermal conductivity, or best insulating performance, of any widely used insulation available on the market today.
 The lower a material’s thermal conductivity, the more slowly heat is transferred across it. R-values are a commonly used measure of an insulating material’s resistance to heat transfer. R-value is calculated as the thickness of an insulation material divided by the thermal conductivity of the insulation material. Materials with higher R-values have lower thermal conductivity and are better insulators. Traditional and specialty insulation materials provide a range of R-values. Aerogels have the highest R-value per meter of thickness in comparison to traditional insulation materials.
 Qualification for Use
 Our products have undergone rigorous testing and are now qualified for global usage in both routine maintenance and in capital projects at many of the world’s largest oil producers, refiners and petrochemical companies. These end-users of our products have well defined practices, codes, specification and standards for materials and systems installed or used in their facilities. These specifications include insulation system design standards, material qualification and selection processes, and insulation application practices. As part of the material qualification process run by these companies, a new insulation must meet general industry standards, such as consensus standards developed by ASTM International, and, in some cases, company-specific internal standards to be considered for use. In addition, most of these companies require one or more field trials to establish fitness for use in specific applications. The companies either run these qualification processes and field trials internally or through third parties engaged by 
 8


them, and they generally do not publicly disclose the results of their testing. While the specific processes and timelines vary from company to company, in general, upon successful completion of the qualification process for an insulation material, an end-user will typically deem the material to be qualified for use in its facilities on a local, regional or global basis for one or more applications. Because our end-use customers are typically businesses with very large operations, our insulation sales likely represent only a small portion of the total insulation used by any one of these companies. Accordingly, once our products are qualified at a company, we continue to seek to expand use of our products by the end-use customer.
 Our Sales Channel
 We market and sell our products primarily through our sales force. Our salespeople are based in North America, Europe and Asia and travel extensively to market and sell our products to new and existing customers. The efforts of our sales force are supported by a small number of sales consultants with extensive knowledge of a particular market or region. Our sales force is required to establish and maintain customer and partner relationships, to deliver highly technical information and to provide first class customer service. We plan to expand our sales force globally to support anticipated growth in customers and demand for our products.
 Our sales force calls on and maintains relationships with participants at all levels of the insulation industry supply chain. We have established and manage a network of insulation distributors to ensure rapid delivery of our products in critical regions. Our salespeople work to educate insulation contractors about the technical and operating cost advantages of aerogel blankets. Our sales force works directly with end-users and engineering firms to promote qualification, specification and acceptance of our products in existing and new applications. In the energy infrastructure market, we rely heavily on the existing and well-established channel of distributors and contractors to deliver products to our customers. In addition, our salespeople work with OEMs and strategic partners to create new products and solutions to expand our market reach.
 The sales cycle for a new insulation material is typically lengthy. Our sales cycle from initial customer trials to widespread use can take from one to three years, although we typically realize increasing revenue at each stage in the cycle. We believe our relationships with technically sophisticated customers and strategic partners serve to validate our technology, products and value proposition within a target market. These relationships have proven to shorten the sales cycle with other customers within specific markets and to facilitate growth in market share. We have focused our marketing efforts on developing technical support materials, installation guides, case studies and general awareness of the superior performance of our aerogel blankets. We rely on our website, printed technical materials, participation in industry conferences and tradeshows and presentation of technical papers to communicate our message to existing and potential customers. We also receive strong word-of-mouth support from the growing network of distributors, contractors, OEMs, strategic partners and end-users that understand the benefits of our products.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 38 employees in our sales and marketing organization worldwide. Their efforts were supported by a team of four sales consultants.
 Our Customers and End-Users
 Customers
 As described below, our primary customers are distributors, contractors and OEMs that stock, install and fabricate insulation products, components and systems for technically sophisticated end-users that require high-performance insulation.

• | Distributors: We currently operate through a global network of over 58 insulation distributors. In general, insulation distributors stock, sell and distribute aerogel materials to insulation contractors and end-users. The distribution of our product outside the United States is typically conducted under agreements that provide for exclusivity by geography linked to annual purchase volume minimums. These insulation distributors often will also proactively market and promote aerogel materials across their market.

 Reliance Industries Limited and Distribution International, Inc. represented 25% and 15%, respectively, of our total revenue for 2016 and were our only customers representing 10% or more of our revenue for that period.
 Our product revenue is generated by sales to customers around the world. In 2016, 29% of our product revenue was generated in the United States, 56% in Asia-Pacific, 10% in Europe, 3% in Canada, 2% in Latin America and less than 1% in the Middle East and Africa based on shipment destination.
 A substantial portion of our sales are to shipment destinations located outside the United States, including India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia and Columbia based on our shipment destination or the location in which research services are performed. Total revenue generated from outside of the United States amounted to $82.0 million or 70% of total revenue, $78.0 million or 64% of total revenue and $62.6 million or 61% of total revenue, in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we may expand our operations outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks; see “Risk Factors — A substantial portion of our revenue comes from sales in foreign countries and we may expand our operations outside of the United States, which subjects us to increased economic, foreign exchange, operational and political risks that could increase our costs and make it difficult for us to operate profitably.”

Building Materials and Other Markets
 Traditionally, we have relied on the efforts of a small network of partners, OEMs and fabrication houses to serve the building materials, transportation, apparel and appliance markets. These partners, OEMs and fabricators are manufacturers of components and systems for buildings, refrigerated and hot appliances, cold storage equipment, automobiles, aircraft, trains and electronic sectors and manufacturers of outdoor gear and apparel. In addition, we have partnered with BASF to develop and commercialize a set of innovative products optimized to meet the needs of the building materials market. While our products have not yet been widely 
 10


adopted in these markets, we expect that the end-users of our products in these markets will include a wide range of institutions, businesses, individuals, and government agencies.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility located in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. Our manufacturing process is proven, scalable and can meet increasing demand.
 Our manufacturing group is led by a seasoned team with management experience at global industrial and specialty chemical companies. Our manufacturing workforce is experienced and, to date, we have experienced employee turnover consistent with others in our industry. We have well-defined maintenance, environmental, health and safety programs and operating processes in place. We utilize statistical processes and quality controls to measure the thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and thickness of our aerogel blankets during the manufacturing process. We are ISO 9001:2008 certified.

 We successfully commenced operation of our third production line at the East Providence facility at the end of March 2015, which increased our annual nameplate capacity to approximately 50 million square feet of aerogel blankets. In November 2015, we announced the selection of Statesboro, Georgia, as the site for our second manufacturing plant. The 43 acre site is served by rail and provides convenient access to local ports. The Statesboro region is served by a well-developed technical educational system, and provides a strong workforce, secure and low-cost utilities and easy access to critical raw materials. State and local governmental authorities also provided us with a package of incentives including outright grants, free land, infrastructure support, tax credits and abatements, training programs and related benefits.
 Based on our preliminary plans for the second facility, our projected cost to construct plant infrastructure and a first production line in two phases is between $120 million and $130 million. We currently expect the first line will increase our estimated annual nameplate capacity by approximately 40 million square feet of aerogel blankets. The plant site, layout and design will support future development of two additional similar production lines. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we elected to temporarily delay construction of this facility to better align the capacity expansion with our assessment of demand for the 2018 to 2020 period.
 We directly control all stages in the manufacture of our aerogel blankets. Our direct ownership of manufacturing operations allows us to maintain control of proprietary process technologies and to control product quality. Our production of aerogel blankets utilizes a continuous process and consists of the following key steps:
  
• | Sol Preparation. Mixing of a silica precursor in ethanol, a catalyst and additives in set formulas to deliver the target properties of the resultant aerogel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casting. Application of the sol into a non-woven batting and initial formation of the gel structure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging. Bathing of the gel-saturated blankets in fluids to impart desired physical and thermal properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction. Supercritical extraction of the ethanol liquid from the gel-saturated blanket to produce an aerogel blanket.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Heat Treatment. Drying to remove trace ethanol, salts and water from the aerogel blankets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finishing. Coating to enhance quality and product handling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality Control. Utilizing statistical process and quality controls to measure thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and thickness of our aerogel blankets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our material costs were the equivalent of 41%, 45% and 46% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of polyester and fiberglass battings, silica precursors and ethanol, which is used in the delivery of the silica precursor. Multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials, and we believe the markets for these products are competitive and prices are relatively stable. We purchase silica precursor from several suppliers. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursor is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursor will be available. Suppliers of silica precursor include industrial companies that produce it directly or that produce it as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop processes to reduce the long-term cost of the silica precursor used in our products. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy —. Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”

We are seeking to lower our manufacturing costs and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our chemistries and manufacturing processes to improve yields, by obtaining material price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors for certain materials and by optimizing shipping costs. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantage and to ensure we deliver high quality finished products.
 Research and Development
 The mission of our research and development team is to leverage innovation in support of our commercial objectives, including by designing additional disruptive products for the energy infrastructure and building materials markets and seeking methods to lower our manufacturing costs and to improve yields. Our research and development expenditures were $5.3 million, $5.3 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we spent $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on research and development activities sponsored by federal and other government agencies. Our scientists and engineers work closely with customers to study and assess insulation application requirements and guide advancements in aerogel materials and manufacturing.
Contract Research and Government Support
 We regularly seek funding from a number of federal and other government agencies in support of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Research performed under contract to the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other institutions allows us to develop and leverage technologies into broader commercial applications. We also work closely with customers in government and industry to develop potential aerogel solutions that leverage not only the thermal insulation performance but other benefits of aerogels as well. The research and development activities that we conduct under such contracts may produce intellectual property to which we may not have ownership or exclusive rights and will be unable to protect or monetize.
 Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may modify, curtail or terminate the contracts at its convenience. Our government customers may not renew our existing contracts after the conclusion of their terms and we may not be able to enter into new contracts with U.S. government agencies. Any decision by the U.S. government not to exercise contract options or to modify, curtail or terminate our contracts or not to renew our contracts or enter into new contracts with us would adversely affect our revenues.
 We have received $51.7 million in funding under government contracts from inception through December 31, 2016. Our contract research revenue was $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $3.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights that cover our product forms, applications and/or manufacturing technologies and specifications and the technology or know-how that enables these product forms, applications, technologies and specifications, to avoid and defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Since aerogels were developed approximately 80 years ago, there has been a wide range of research, development and publication on aerogels, which makes it difficult to establish intellectual property rights to many key elements of aerogel technology and to obtain patent protection. Where we consider it appropriate, our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights by filing United States and foreign patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that we consider patentable and important to the development and conduct of our business and, in particular, our aerogel technology, product forms and their applications in promising markets and our manufacturing technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, licensing agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to safeguard our intellectual property rights and develop and maintain our competitive advantage.
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned 37 issued U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. patent applications (including three issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application that we co-own with third parties), 56 issued foreign patents and 59 pending foreign patent applications (including 17 issued foreign patents and four pending foreign patent applications that we co-own with third parties). The U.S. patents that we own are generally effective for 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which each U.S. patent claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. Our patents start to expire in December 2021.
 In May 2016, we filed a complaint against Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., or Alison, and Nano Tech Co., Ltd, or Nano, in the United States International Trade Commission in which we allege that these two China-based companies are engaging in unfair trade practices by importing aerogel products in the United States that infringe several of our patents. We refer to Alison and Nano as 
 12


the Respondents. In the complaint, we are seeking exclusion orders directing United States Customs and Border Protection to stop the importation of infringing products. In June 2016, the ITC instituted an investigation based on our complaint. The investigation is ongoing with participation from Alison and Nano through their respective counsel. In addition to Alison and Nano’s contention at the ITC that the patents we have asserted are invalid, Alison has also filed petitions with United States Patent and Trademark Office requesting Inter-Partes Review to cancel certain claims in three of the asserted manufacturing process patents and a product form patent. Alison has also filed similar requests with the Chinese Patent Office to invalidate our product form patent, two manufacturing process related patents and another unrelated patent in China.
 In April 2016, we also filed a patent infringement suit at the District Court in Mannheim, Germany against the Respondents and two European distributors. We have since settled with one European distributor in exchange for a commitment not to procure infringing products and cooperation with our case. The litigation against the other defendants is ongoing. In addition, Nano has initiated a nullity action in German Federal Patent Court against one of our manufacturing process patents in Germany.
 Due to their nature, it is difficult to predict the outcome in any litigation. Furthermore, Alison and Nano may have significant resources and interest to litigate and therefore, this litigation could be protracted and may ultimately involve significant legal expenses. We have incurred approximately $3.8 million of expenses related to this litigation through December 31, 2016.
 We believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore we use trademarks to brand some of our products, including Pyrogel, Cryogel and Spaceloft. As of December 31, 2016, we had five trademark registrations in the United States and 48 trademark registrations in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and Brazil. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, our approach may not be comprehensive enough or we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration.
 Cross License Agreement with Cabot Corporation
 In April 2006, we entered into a cross license agreement with Cabot Corporation, as amended in September 2007, in which each party granted certain intellectual property rights to the other party. The cross license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last to expire of the issued patents or patent applications and acquired patents licensed thereunder. We hold a non-exclusive, worldwide license to those patents and patent applications owned or licensed by Cabot that are necessary for us to (i) practice our manufacturing technology within a field of use, which is defined in accordance with the specific chemistry of our aerogel products and the supercritical fluid technology that we use in our manufacturing technology and (ii) use and sell the resulting aerogel blanket and derivative products. We paid Cabot $38 million over a period of approximately seven years, with the last payment made in March 2013, in connection with this license agreement. We have granted to Cabot a reciprocal, non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications that we own that are necessary for Cabot to practice its processes within a field of use defined in accordance with the specific chemistry in its aerogel products and the drying technology that it uses to manufacture its products. The grant of license to each party covers issued patents, patent applications and patents issued from such counterpart applications, as well as patents licensed or acquired during a specified term, in each case that claim aerogels, or methods, materials of manufacture, or uses of aerogels.
Our Company
 We are a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. In June 2008, we completed a reorganization pursuant to which our predecessor company merged with and into a newly formed Delaware corporation, renamed Aspen Aerogels, Inc. We own three wholly owned subsidiaries: Aspen Aerogels Rhode Island, LLC, Aspen Aerogels Germany, GmbH and Aspen Aerogels Georgia, LLC, which was formed in August 2016. We maintain our corporate offices in Northborough, Massachusetts.
 On June 18, 2014, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 7,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. As of March 1, 2017, we had 23,369,838 shares of our common stock outstanding.
 We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. You may read and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 281 full-time employees and one part-time employee, with 31 in research and development, 187 in manufacturing operations and supply chain, 38 in sales and marketing and 25 in general and administrative functions. Of our employees, 272 are located in the United States and nine are located abroad. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be of good standing. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or have collective bargaining agreements.
Seasonality
 Our industry and product offering makes us less susceptible to seasonal patterns as our operating results are generated in part by demand for insulation associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, and larger maintenance-related projects in the energy infrastructure market. Historically, our second and fourth quarter results have shown an increase in revenue, which we believe is associated with our end-use customers’ maintenance schedules and timing of capital projects.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations. See “Risk Factors — We may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
