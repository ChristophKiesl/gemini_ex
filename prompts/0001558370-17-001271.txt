     Item 1.Business
     As used herein, “CPI”, “we”, “our” and similar terms refer to CPI Card Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
     Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive Financial Payment Card solutions in the United States. We define “Financial Payment Cards” as credit, debit and Prepaid Debit Cards issued on the networks of the “Payment Card Brands” (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) and Interac (in Canada). We define “Prepaid Debit Cards” as debit cards issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, but not linked to a traditional bank account. We have established a leading position in the Financial Payment Card market through more than 20 years of experience and are focused primarily on this growing subsector of the financial technology market. Our customers are primarily leading national and regional banks, independent community banks, credit unions, managers of prepaid debit programs, “Group Service Providers” (organizations that assist small card issuers, such as credit unions, with managing their credit and debit card programs, including managing the Financial Payment Card issuance process) and card processors. We serve a diverse set of over 4,000 direct and indirect customers, including many of the largest issuers of debit and credit cards in the United States and Canada, and largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers, as well as thousands of independent community banks, credit unions, Group Service Providers and card processors.
     We serve our customers through a network of ten production and card services facilities, including eight high-security facilities in the United States and Canada, each of which is certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada) and, where required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (the “PCI Security Standards Council”). We have a leading network of high-security production facilities in the United States and Canada, allowing us to optimize our solutions offerings to serve the needs of our diverse and long-term customer base.
     We believe we have a leading position in:
    
· | the U.S. prepaid debit market (which represents the fastest growing subset of the Financial Payment Card market in the United States), serving several of the top U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the U.S. large issuer market, serving many of the largest U.S. debit and credit card issuers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the U.S. small issuer market, which includes independent community banks and credit unions, driven by our strong relationships, capabilities and technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition to our eight facilities in the United States and Canada, we have two facilities in the United Kingdom that produce retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards, that are not issued on the networks of the Payment Card Brands, as well as provide personalization, packaging and fulfillment services.  
     We have grown our business significantly over the past decade, both organically and through acquisitions. Since 2008, we have completed six acquisitions, significantly increasing our geographic and market coverage, solutions offerings and capacity. Our most significant acquisitions occurred in March 2010 and September 2014.  On March 9, 2010, we purchased certain assets of Premier Card Solutions, a leading provider of Financial Payment Cards, data personalization services and tamper-evident security packaging for Prepaid Debit Cards that utilize the payment networks of the Payment Card Brands. The Premier Card Solutions transaction significantly enhanced our offering to Prepaid Debit Card customers. On September 2, 2014, we acquired EFT Source, a recognized leader in the financial technology industry. The acquisition of EFT Source significantly enhanced our card services offering, added Card@Once® to our instant issuance card offering and expanded our end-to-end Financial Payment Card solutions.  We intend to continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities.
     In 2016, we generated:

· | Net sales of $308.7 million, which represented a decrease of 17.5% compared to the prior year,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Net income from continuing operations of $5.4 million, which represented a decrease of 82.7% compared to the prior year, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adjusted EBITDA of $57.2 million, which represented a decrease of 40.6% compared to the prior year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, see Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data.
     Our business consists of the following reportable segments: U.S. Debit and Credit, which primarily produces Financial Payment Cards and provides integrated card services to card-issuing banks in the United States; U.S. Prepaid Debit, which primarily provides integrated card services to Prepaid Debit Card issuers in the United States; and U.K. Limited, which primarily produces retail cards, such as gift and loyalty cards for customers in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, and which are not certified by any of the Payment Card Brands or to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council, but are certified to be in compliance with International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 standards. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other" and include our operations in Ontario, Canada and Petersfield, United Kingdom. In August 2015, we completed the shut-down and closure of our operations at our Petersfield, United Kingdom facility. The Petersfield, United Kingdom facility is not material to our business. Also included in “Other” are corporate activities.
     For information regarding our net sales by geographic location and additional details regarding our segments, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 "Segment Reporting," and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     Our Competitive Strengths
    
· | Leading Market Position with Long-Term Customer Relationships. As a market leader, we have long-standing trust-based relationships with our key customers, many of whom we have served for decades. Our customer relationships often involve deep process and technology integration, particularly in the case of customers who utilize our card services and instant issuance systems and services. The solutions that we provide require strict data integrity, and generally card issuers are reluctant to switch away from trusted providers due to the requirements for high-security and access to highly-sensitive cardholder information. As a result, our customers are selective about the partners with which they work and typically seek out partners who have a well-established reputation for trust and quality and are able to meet their service requirements. We take pride in our efforts to provide a differentiated level of service to our customer base. Our strong net promoter score, a customer satisfaction metric developed through surveys conducted by an independent market research firm, is evidence of our ability to provide this differentiated level of service. We also maintain important relationships with the Payment Card Brands to ensure our facilities and processes consistently meet their standards.

· | Well Positioned to Capitalize on Growth in Financial Payment Card Market and Remaining EMV Conversion in the United States. With the significant past investments made to our physical infrastructure and equipment platform in preparation for the EMV conversion, including information technology, human capital and equipment upgrades across our network of facilities, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to capitalize on the continued growth in the Financial Payment Card market, and the U.S. market conversion to the Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV”) chip technology, which began in earnest in the second half of 2014 and is expected to continue over the next several years. EMV is a global, technical standard, maintained by EMVCo for smart payment cards, and for payment terminals and automated teller machines that accept them. EMV cards are smart cards (also called chip cards) which store data on integrated circuits rather than magnetic stripes, although EMV cards may have magnetic stripes. EMV cards can be contact cards that must be physically inserted (or “dipped”) into a reader, contactless cards that can be read over a short distance using radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) technology, or cards with both contact and contactless functionality (“dual-interface EMV cards”). We serve our customers through a network of ten production and card services facilities, including eight high-security facilities in the United States and Canada that are each certified by one or more of the Payment

Card Brands, Interac (in Canada) and, where required by our customers, certified to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Comprehensive End-to-End Card Solutions Drive Deep Customer Integration. The foundation of our strong market position is our comprehensive end-to-end Financial Payment Card solutions. Our solutions provide a full suite of products and card services required to produce, personalize and fulfill Financial Payment Cards, while maintaining the stringent security requirements of the Payment Card Brands. We are integral to many of our customers’ card programs, pairing card production with an end-to-end offering of card data personalization and card services that are deeply integrated within our customers’ operations. We provide card data personalization services for financial institutions and managers of Prepaid Debit Card programs that require extensive technology integration, such as secure data links to transfer highly sensitive cardholder information. Similarly, our installed base of instant issuance systems at bank and credit union branches across the United States require comparable levels of customer integration, as our Card@Once® instant issuance system utilizes only our secure technology to instantly personalize cards. Certain customers have also integrated our proprietary software into their customer-facing websites to offer card design and customization to their cardholders. We believe that our comprehensive solution allows our customers to choose a single trusted partner to address their card program needs in a cost-effective manner instead of managing multiple suppliers across a complex value chain. We believe our customers choose and retain us for these critical functions, which typically require integrations that are costly and complex, due to our reputation as a trusted partner, our high levels of service and proven execution.

· | Certified Network of High-Security Facilities. Our eight high-security facilities are each certified by one or more of the Payment Card Brands and Interac (in Canada), forming a leading network of certified production facilities in in the United States and Canada. The Payment Card Brand certifications allow us to produce cards bearing these brands and provide relevant card services for our issuer customers. Additionally, many of our facilities are also certified to be in compliance with the standards of the PCI Security Standards Council. These certification processes are long, complex and costly, and our facilities must comply with strict standards of security in order to obtain and retain this designation, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry Experience and Proprietary and Patented Solutions. Over the course of our long operating history, we have developed extensive technological, engineering and operational expertise that we believe has made us a leader in our industry for product and process know-how. We believe that our technological and operational know-how, combined with our specific focus on the Financial Payment Card market, gives us a competitive advantage and fosters a culture of innovation. We have developed and acquired significant intellectual property over our operating history and hold 18 U.S. patents, 14 foreign patents, as well as 13 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, on our Financial Payment Card solutions, including patents on our instant issuance offering, and patents on our tamper-evident security packaging used by our customers that have Prepaid Debit Card offerings. We also hold exclusive production rights to certain products the Company has developed, as well as patented software solutions such as our MYCA™ offering, which is integrated into the websites of over 300 card issuing banks and other customers.

· | Experienced Management Team. We have built an experienced management team, and have strengthened the team during 2016 with the addition of key executives with distinguished records of accomplishments. The leadership, depth of experience and relevant market knowledge the management team brings will be invaluable as we execute on our plans moving forward.

      Our Strategy
     The key components of our strategy include: 


Drive Growth in the Core Financial Markets:
    
· | Continue to Capitalize on Growth in Financial Payment Card Market and the U.S. EMV Conversion, Including Dual-Interface EMV Cards. We expect future growth in the U.S. Financial Payment Card market as card-based payments continue to replace payments made with cash and checks, along with the recurring nature of demand for Financial Payment Cards in the United States, including the regular renewal 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of cards every three to five years, replacing lost or stolen cards due to fraudulent usage, and portfolio churn as cardholders move from one program to another. In addition, the conversion of Financial Payment Cards in the United States from magnetic stripe technology to the EMV standard began in earnest in the second half of 2014 and is expected to continue over the next several years. In anticipation of the EMV conversion, and subsequently the expected further adoption of the more complex and higher priced dual-interface EMV cards, we invested significantly in our network of facilities, technological infrastructure and human capital resources. We believe our comprehensive solutions offering and proven track record ideally positions us to be our customers’ partner of choice for their ongoing Financial Payment Card needs, and to successfully complete their EMV conversions. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capitalize on Growth in Prepaid Debit Market. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected growth of the Prepaid Debit Card market due to our market leading position, supported by our industry expertise, comprehensive end-to-end card solutions and patents. We have a leading market position and have been doing business with the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers. Additionally, we have further developed proprietary production techniques which provide us additional flexibility to meet customer demands. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cross-Sell Expanded Services Offering Across Customer Base. We believe our leading market position in Financial Payment Card production and our card services capabilities in the United States and Canada, presents an opportunity to cross-sell services across our customer base by offering comprehensive end-to-end card solutions. We believe that providing our existing customers this complete end-to-end solution creates a revenue opportunity and means to further deepen our existing customer relationships. Through our strong track record in card services, we believe we have established a reputation as a trusted partner and advisor to our customers with the ability to securely manage sensitive and confidential customer data throughout our network. Due to the high costs of failure, such as a data breach, we believe that that we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, who expect their vendors to provide high levels of security, service and certainty to manage these critical functions.

· | Continued Exploration of Strategic Acquisitions. We have a strong track record of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses, completing six acquisitions since 2008, which have enhanced our market share, capabilities and capacity. We expect to continue to explore strategic acquisitions that give us access to new markets and capabilities.

      Provide New and Innovative Products and Services in the Markets We Serve:
    
· | Capitalize on Growth in Instant Issuance Systems and Services Market. We acquired our instant card issuance system, Card@Once®, through the acquisition of EFT Source in 2014 and have continued to drive growth in sales of our instant issuance systems and related services revenue. We plan to continue to grow our installed base of instant issuance systems in bank branches across the United States to increase our opportunity for continued recurring revenue streams from card personalization which is delivered through our software as a service offering. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop New Products and Services to Deepen Existing Customer Relationships and Attract New Customers. In addition, through our recently added Print on Demand capabilities, we are able to produce images, personalized payment cards and related collateral on a one-by-one, on demand, basis for our U.S. Prepaid Debit customers, enabling individualized offerings and reducing waste. We believe this will enable us to further penetrate new, fast growing, verticals of the prepaid market including payroll, corporate incentives and benefits. In addition, we recently announced new products, including a metal card offering for the credit card markets, and dual-interface or “tap-and-go” EMV cards, both of which represent important opportunities to add to the growth of the business.

We have continued to expand our digital services capabilities, focusing on enabling payments for the growing e-commerce and mobile market place, including online card design and card re-orders, order status, inventory management, EMV key management, and fulfillment of plastic and virtual payment cards, including our patented card design software, known as MYCA™, which provides our customers and their cardholders the ability to design cards on the internet and customize cards with individualized digital images. While not currently

      Our Products and Services
     EMV Financial Payment Cards (Contact and Dual-Interface)
     We produce contact EMV cards, which feature an integrated circuit that interfaces with an EMV payment terminal over a contact plate on the surface of the card when inserted into an EMV-enabled payment terminal. We also produce dual-interface EMV cards, which feature both the contact EMV technology and an RFID antenna that utilizes near field communications (“NFC”) technology to allow transactions to also be processed on a contactless basis when the card is brought within the requisite proximity to a NFC-enabled payment terminal.     Non-EMV Financial Payment Cards and Retail Gift Cards
     We produce non-EMV cards that utilize magnetic stripes, contactless cards which utilize NFC technology and cards that include both magnetic stripes and NFC technology. In addition, we produce retail gift cards (which are not issued on the network of the Payment Card Brands) primarily in the U.K. and Canada.     Card Data Personalization and Fulfillment
     We provide data preparation and card data personalization solutions for debit, credit and Prepaid Debit Cards in EMV and non-EMV card formats. Our personalization services are technology-driven and provide a wide range of card customization options, using advanced processes to personalize (encode, program and emboss with data such as cardholder name and account number) and fulfill cards to individual cardholders. In addition, we provide EMV data script development services for our customers and in certain cases generate PIN numbers and mailers on their behalf. We offer patented card design software, known as MYCA™, which provides our customers and their cardholders the ability to design cards on the internet and customize cards with individualized digital images. We also provide consultation and card design services to further assist customers in card customization. Finally, we have the capabilities to provide Trusted Service Manager services, leveraging our existing data connectivity with processors and other customers to offer a trusted, high-security solution for facilitating mobile payments.     Tamper-Evident Security Packaging Solutions
     We offer specialized and innovative tamper-evident security packaging products and services to customers with a Prepaid Debit Card offering that reduce fraud for Prepaid Debit Cards sold through the retail channel. The majority of the tamper-evident security packaging we produce is protected by our patents. In certain cases, we also manage the fulfillment of fully-completed Prepaid Debit Card packages to retail locations on behalf of our customers utilizing this solution.     Instant Card Issuance Systems and Services 
     We offer Card@Once®, our proprietary and patented instant card issuance system and services, which provide our card issuing bank customers the ability to issue a completely personalized permanent debit or credit card within the bank branch to individual cardholders upon demand. Our instant issuance system is enabled by cloud-based software that securely transfers data from our servers to the card branch to encode either a magnetic stripe or an EMV card, and personalize the card on a desktop output terminal in a process which is certified by MasterCard and Visa. Our instant issuance system generates both system sales and recurring revenue from software as a service, card personalization and

sales of cards and consumables. In addition, we provide instant issuance of debit cards to large financial institutions whereby we provide fully-personalized temporary debit cards which are issued to card holders upon opening a new account, and we manage the fulfillment and replenishment of these fully personalized cards directly to thousands of individual bank branches.
     Print on Demand Prepaid Solutions
     We recently launched our new Print on Demand solution, which can deliver significant flexibility to prepaid program managers and financial institutions.  Through our Print on Demand services, we are able to produce images, personalized payment cards and related collateral on a one-by-one, on demand, basis for our customers, enabling individualized offerings and reducing waste. While not significant to our 2016 financial results, the Print on Demand solution enables us to further penetrate new, fast growing, business-to-business and business-to-consumer verticals of the prepaid market including payroll, corporate incentives and benefits.      Suppliers
     One of the most important components of our products is the EMV microchip, which we expect to become even more significant as EMV cards comprise an increasing percentage of the cards we produce. While we have developed constructive relationships with our suppliers and, in general, receive a high level of cooperation and support from them, the objective of our procurement strategy is not to depend on any single supplier. We obtain our components from multiple suppliers located in South Korea, France, the United States and Singapore, primarily on a purchase order basis. Our main suppliers of EMV microchips are four leading international manufacturers, including one supplier that is also owned by a competitor. Over 90% of our purchased EMV microchips for the year ended December 31, 2016 came from these four main suppliers. The other key components for our products are substrates (such as PVC), antennas and inlays which we also source from multiple suppliers. We continuously monitor supply chain risks and evaluate alternative suppliers based on numerous attributes including quality, performance, service, scalability, features, innovation and price.     Customers
     In the United States, we categorize our customers as follows: large issuers, small to mid-sized issuers, prepaid debit issuers and program managers. Our diverse customer base includes many of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the United States and the largest U.S. Prepaid Debit Card program managers. Our top five customers represented approximately 29.4% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and we have been serving these customers for an average of greater than 10 years.
     We generally enter into master purchase or service agreements that govern the general terms and conditions of our commercial relationships. We then enter into purchase order or other short-term arrangements that define the prices and the quantities of products to be delivered and services rendered. Usually, our contractual arrangements include neither exclusivity clauses nor commitments from our customers to order any given quantities of products on a medium or long-term basis.
     Production and Services
     Our production and services strategy has several key facets. We have a large network of integrated high-security facilities that we leverage to balance customer orders, expand the array of products and services available to our customers, provide consistent supply and execute short lead times. Our facilities and operating processes are designed to provide a differentiated level of service to each of our key customer sets. For example, we have the processes and capabilities to:
· | execute high-volume production runs that allow us to meet the competitive price points of large orders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | execute lower-volume, highly personalized customized runs that allow us to meet the high-service and quick-turn needs of smaller orders; and

· | meet the specific needs of our Prepaid Debit Card customers, as an industry leader in tamper-evident secure card packaging, and our significant expertise and capabilities specifically designed for this retail prepaid

market, as well as on demand solutions for the business-to-business and business-to-consumer prepaid markets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our digital services are designed to scale quickly to efficiently support a growing number of issuers and end users. These services encompass a variety of secure hosted solutions, which enable improved customer service and efficiencies for our customers. 
     We operate approximately 500,000 square feet of facilities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, where we focus on Financial Payment Card production and personalization services. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the operations of each facility.
     We rely on secure ground and secure air freight to deliver products to our banking customers. Due to the high-security nature of the products we provide to our banking customers, product must be shipped to these customers via a secure method, such as armored vehicle. With respect to customers for whom we fulfill individual and personalized debit and credit cards, we utilize the U.S., Canadian and U.K. postal services to deliver these cards directly to individual cardholders. For other customers, we predominately deliver our products via regular ground and air freight.
     Sales and Marketing
     We market our products and services to large issuers, small to mid-sized issuers, prepaid debit issuers and program managers. We have approximately 30 field-based sales representatives that give us a wide geographic reach across the United States, Western Europe and Canada. Our sales representatives offer a complete end-to-end solution that incorporates the full spectrum of our products and services from concept to delivery. Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on strengthening our relationships with existing customers, providing a differentiated offer that includes cross-selling expanded services. We leverage the strength of our full-service offerings to attract new customers. Our marketing efforts focus on the needs of our specific types of customers. By tailoring our marketing strategy to different customer groups, we are able to provide relevant targeted solutions to meet their individual needs. We utilize an array of different marketing communications focused on thought leadership that include industry publications, editorial white papers, conferences and trade shows, print and digital advertisements and educational webinars designed to introduce our existing customers and new customers to innovations in the payments market. Through these efforts, we drive customer retention and satisfaction, and have been able to attract new customers.     Competition
     The market for products and services in the payment card industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, and therefore have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and competitive pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, service reliability, product line comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories.
     Our products and services compete with other card manufacturers and card solutions providers. We believe our primary competitors are Oberthur Technologies S.A., Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, Valid S.A., Gemalto NV and Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc. Certain existing and potential customers also have the ability to personalize Financial Payment Cards in-house. In addition, we compete with customers that offer transaction processing products and services to financial institutions.  
     Intellectual Property
     We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights and applications. We are also a party to certain patent cross-license arrangements with industry participants and may, from time to time, enter into similar commercial agreements should we consider it necessary or beneficial for our business.
     We rely on a combination of statutory (copyright, trademark and trade secret) and contractual safeguards for intellectual property protection throughout the world. As of December 31, 2016, we had 30 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and applications, 18 existing U.S. patents, 14 foreign patents, as well as 13 pending U.S. and foreign patent 

 
  9

 
applications. Our patents have an average remaining maturity of 12.5 years, and our trademarks will be due for renewal for additional ten or fifteen-year periods on an ongoing basis.
     Environmental Protection
     Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental protection regulations, including those governing the emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We believe that we are in compliance with environmental requirements, however, the unfavorable resolution of any environmental matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.     Regulation
     Privacy and Data Security
     In the course of our business, we receive personally identifiable information of cardholders from our customers, either from a financial institution or through a card processor on behalf of a financial institution. Such information includes names, addresses, card account numbers and expiration dates. In some cases, we receive a cardholder’s PIN number. As a service provider to financial institutions in the United States, we comply with the privacy provisions of Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) and its implementing regulations and, as applicable, with various other federal, state and foreign privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI Security Standards Council’s Data Security Standards, each of which is subject to change at any time. We may only use and disclose the personal information we receive on behalf of our customers for the purposes for which it was provided to us and in a manner that is consistent with each financial institution’s and processor’s own data privacy and security obligations.
     In order to comply with our obligations under the GLBA, applicable state laws and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are required to safeguard and protect the privacy of personally identifiable information we receive. As part of their compliance with these requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, consumer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers. A majority of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, which could result in significant costs to us and significant damage to our reputation.
     The interpretation of pending and existing laws and regulations is evolving and, therefore, these laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and breaches in the security of our systems and technology could result in a violation of these laws and regulations.
     We are also subject to requirements from the Payment Card Brands, which require us to meet certain security standards in order to achieve certification that allows us to produce and personalize Financial Payment Cards issued on their networks. These standards include extensive requirements with respect to the physical characteristics of our facilities, as well as our electronic treatment and storage of cardholder data. We believe that we have developed significant expertise in acquiring and maintaining these certifications, and have invested significant capital to obtain and retain these designations, which are regularly verified by both the Payment Card Brands and our customers. We believe the long, complex and costly certification process serves as a significant barrier to new entrants to our market.
     Financial Services
     We are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of products and services to these financial institutions, our operations may be examined by various state and federal regulatory authorities and representatives of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. Also, state and federal regulations require our financial institution clients to include certain provisions in their contracts with service providers like us and

to conduct ongoing monitoring and risk management for third party relationships. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients’ auditors.
     In conducting certain of our card services, we are directly subject to various federal and state laws and regulations including those relating to the movement of money. In order to comply with our obligations under applicable laws, we are required, among other things, to comply with licensing and reporting requirements, to implement operating policies and procedures to comply with anti-money laundering laws, to protect the privacy and security of our clients’ information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.
     In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; implement changes to corporate governance and executive compensation practices; and require significant rule-making. The Dodd-Frank Act has generated numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our clients. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to “supervised service providers” which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. The CFPB has in the past and may in the future issue regulations that may require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources. We do not currently anticipate a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition due to these regulations, but it is difficult to predict with certainty the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the businesses of our current and potential clients.
     Employees and Labor
     As of December 31, 2016, our businesses employed 1,308 employees, all of whom are full time employees.  We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes.  We consider our relations with employees to be good.      Available Information
