ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
Jason Industries, a Delaware corporation originally formed in May 2013, is a global industrial manufacturing company with significant market share positions in each of its two segments: industrial and engineered components. The Company provides critical components and manufacturing solutions to customers across a wide range of end markets, industries and geographies through its global network of 23 manufacturing facilities and nine sales, administrative and/or warehouse facilities throughout the United States and 13 foreign countries. The Company has embedded relationships with long standing customers, superior scale and resources, and specialized capabilities to design and manufacture specialized products on which our customers rely. In the first quarter of 2019, as part of a review of our organizational structure, the Company made certain strategic leadership changes which required a reassessment of reportable segments. Based on this evaluation, the Company changed how it makes operating decisions, assesses performance of the business, and allocates resources. As a result of the evaluation, the Company reduced the number of operating and reportable segments from four to three: industrial, engineered components and fiber solutions. The prior year segment disclosures have been updated to conform with the current year presentation.
During 2019, the Company determined that both the North American fiber solutions business and the Metalex business within the engineered components segment met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the Company’s prior period results of operations, financial position and notes to the financial statements have been recast to be presented on a continuing operations basis, except where noted. The assets and liabilities of the North American fiber solutions business and the Metalex business have been presented as held for sale for the periods prior to the sale. On August 30, 2019 and on December 13, 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of its North American fiber solutions business and its Metalex business, respectively. Previously, on August 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the European fiber solutions business, which did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations presentation at the time of the divestiture. As such, the results of the European fiber solutions business are presented within continuing operations through the date of the sale.
On August 12, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had engaged financial advisors to advise us as we conduct a process to evaluate strategic alternatives. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to, a potential sale, strategic merger, consolidation or business combination, acquisition, recapitalization, financing consisting of equity and/or debt securities, and/or a restructuring of the Company’s debt, focused on maximizing the value of the Company for its stakeholders. 
The Company focuses on markets with long-term sustainable growth characteristics and where it is, or has the opportunity to become, the industry leader. The industrial segment focuses on the production of industrial brushes, polishing buffs and compounds, abrasives, and roller technology products that are used in a broad range of industrial and infrastructure applications. The engineered components segment designs, engineers, and manufactures seating products used in heavy industry (construction, agriculture, and material handling), turf care, and power sports applications. 
Description of Business Segments

Industrial
Market/Industry Overview
The industrial segment’s product lines are comprised of industrial brushes, polishing buffs and compounds, abrasives, and roller technology products that are used in a broad range of industrial and infrastructure applications. The market for industrial products is highly fragmented with most participants having single or limited product lines and serving specific geographic markets. While the industrial business competes with numerous domestic and international companies across a variety of product lines, we do not believe that any one competitor directly competes with us on all of our product lines. We believe we are the only market participant that reaches all regions of the world. End users of industrial products are broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy. In the long-term, the industrial market is closely tied to overall growth in industrial production, which we believe has fundamental long-term growth potential.
The industrial market is also characterized by the need for sophisticated manufacturing equipment, the ability to produce a broad number of niche products and the flexibility in manufacturing operations to adapt to ever-changing customer demands and schedules. We believe entry into markets by competitors with lower labor costs, including foreign competitors, will be limited because labor is a relatively small portion of total manufacturing costs. Additionally, the cost of labor, manufacturing, shipping and logistics is dramatically rising in countries such as China and customers continue to have increasing demand for shorter lead times and lower inventory and carrying costs.
Key Products
Through the industrial business, which represented 59.6% of our 2019 revenue, we produce and supply industrial brushes, polishing buffs and compounds, abrasives, and roller technology products. Our industrial business, which operates under the Osborn name, has been in operation since 1887. Our products are used in a variety of applications with no single customer or industry accounting for a significant portion of business revenue. We have strategic facilities located globally, including production sites in low-cost locations such as China, India, Portugal, Romania and Mexico.
The industrial business is a one-stop provider of standard and customized brush, polishing, and abrasives products used across multiple industries, including aerospace, automotive, construction, engineering, plastic, steel, hardware, welding and shipbuilding, among others. Our broad product suite is composed of brush types used for a variety of applications, including material deburring, removal and cleaning, conveying and transportation systems, and thermal sealing systems. These products are marketed under the leading brand name Osborn®. Our buff products are comprised of industrial buffs and abrasives used primarily to finish parts requiring a high degree of luster and/or a satin or textured surface. In addition to manufacturing buffs, we also produce the industry’s broadest product line of buffing compounds available in liquid or bar form that are customized to specific end use requirements. Our abrasive products include cutting and grinding discs, flap discs and wheels, as well as diamond cutting wheels and tools. We also service customers with products complementing our brush, polishing, and abrasives lines, including heavy-duty idler rollers for high-capacity precision load handling.
We have representatives who reach more than 19,000 customers in approximately 112 countries worldwide. During 2019, the industrial segment derived approximately 43% of its sales from North America and the majority of the remaining revenue from Europe. We service our diverse customer base through our primary U.S. facilities in Indiana and Ohio and 12 foreign countries, including joint ventures in China and Taiwan. Our manufacturing and service locations allow us to work on a regional and local basis with customers to develop custom products and provide significant technical support, resulting in strong relationships with our top customers that average 25 years. On April 1, 2019, we acquired Schaffner Manufacturing Company, Inc., which expanded our polishing and abrasive product line offerings within North America. In addition, we have invested in state-of-the-art laboratories in Indiana and Germany to provide further technical design, testing and support capabilities for our customers.
Engineered Components
Market/Industry Overview
The engineered components segment’s product line includes motorcycle seats; operator seats for construction, agriculture, lawn and turf care and other industrial equipment markets; and seating for the power sports market, all under the Milsco brand. The market for engineered components products is comprised primarily of large domestic and international participants, who often award contracts to be the sole supplier for a particular motorcycle, riding lawn mower or other construction, agriculture or material handling platform. We believe that competitive differentiation is based mostly on innovative styling, ergonomic comfort, manufacturing flexibility, quality, price and delivery.
Motorcycle production has experienced a decline over the past several years and we believe future demand will mirror global motorcycle market trends. The construction market is closely tied to overall growth in industrial production, which we believe has long-term growth potential. Demand for lawn, turf care and power sports equipment is primarily dependent on weather and trends in personal consumption expenditures, recreational and leisure activities, and residential and commercial 
real estate construction and sales. The market for lawn and turf care equipment has declined in the past year due to channel inventory destocking, limited growth in U.S. housing construction, and on a long-term basis we expect it to mirror general economic conditions.
Key Products
Through the engineered components segment, which represented 40.4% of our 2019 revenue, we provide highly engineered upholstered and foam-in place static and suspension seating solutions for a variety of applications, including motorcycle, agricultural, construction, industrial, lawn and turf care, and power sports. The engineered components segment operates under the Milsco brand, which was originally established as a harness maker in 1924 and, early in its history, gained notice as the first company to put padded seating on tractors and farm equipment. Milsco has provided high-quality seats since 1934.
The engineered components segment offers a distinct vertically integrated operating model, which includes a full range of functions, such as research and development, design and engineering, manufacturing of components and final assembly. Through our broad manufacturing capabilities and high quality products, we have established longstanding relationships with our top customers, which average over 30 years.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following key characteristics provide a competitive advantage and position us for future growth:
Established Industry Leader Across Our Businesses
Our businesses have developed leading positions across various niche markets that enhance end user’s comfort, safety and productivity. For example, in our turf care seats and polishing product lines, we believe we are more than twice the size of the next largest direct competitor. Our market share positions have created a stable platform upon which to grow and our significant brand recognition helps to sustain our market share positions. Our products are often viewed as a brand of choice for quality, dependability, value and continuous innovation. As a result, we have served many of our customers for over 25 years. Despite leading positions in many of our markets, we face competitive challenges in others. In our industrial and engineered components segments, certain of our competitors are small and family-owned, operate with lower operating expenses, have lower profit expectations and/or supply lower cost commodity products, which allows such competitors to compete with us on pricing. In our engineered components segment, specifically with respect to highly technical seats for the agricultural and construction vehicle markets, the cost to customers of switching from a current supplier’s products to ours is high, and we believe certain of our competitors have established long-term and entrenched relationships with such customers. These costs and relationships make it challenging to convince such customers to purchase products from us instead of from their existing supplier.
Superior Design & Manufacturing Solutions
We have a track record of providing customers with innovative, customized solutions through production flexibility and collaboration with their design and manufacturing teams. We have consistently refined manufacturing processes to incorporate design technologies that improve design capabilities, breadth of product offering, product quality and manufacturing efficiency.
Across our businesses, we maintain teams of engineers and designers as well as a diverse product selection in numerous geographic regions, which allows us to respond quickly to real-time customer needs. Our versatile design and manufacturing capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated and highly-customized solutions for customers by leveraging experienced engineering staff and technologically advanced manufacturing equipment. We believe our diverse product offerings and customized design and manufacturing capabilities have made us a preferred choice within many industries and an entrenched key solutions provider to customers.
We believe we have become a partner at each stage in product development, which has deepened our relationships with an already entrenched customer base and driven revenue growth from existing accounts and new customers.
Scalable Business Philosophy
We use a consistent strategy and focus and deploy capital and resources across our businesses to projects with the highest returns on invested capital. Through corporate strategic planning initiatives, we annually assess our three-year outlook and goals, by using a policy deployment matrix disseminated throughout the organization. Management utilizes the strategic plan and resulting policy deployment matrix to develop an annual budget and profit plan and monitors progress towards long-term strategic goals.
Across our businesses, our management team is focused on enhancing product innovation, efficiency, global accessibility and competitiveness. Shared best practices serve to continually improve the processes and products that our 
customers depend on by delivering customized, value-added solutions across the platform. This global reach offers customers a consistent and fully integrated manufacturing partner capable of serving their needs on a global, regional and local basis.
Diverse, Global Footprint with Growing Presence in Emerging Markets
We maintain 23 global manufacturing locations, consisting of nine in the United States and 14 in foreign countries, giving us a strong international presence. Approximately 37% of our 2019 revenue from continuing operations was generated from products manufactured outside of the United States. In addition, our global presence enables us to take advantage of low-cost manufacturing at our facilities in China, India, Portugal, Romania, and Mexico and to meet the needs of local customers with operations in those regions. We continue to build upon our established presence in low-cost production locations through the expansion of owned operations and the development of joint ventures and sourcing relationships in Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Our management believes that this global footprint also provides channels of organic growth through the introduction of products into new markets. Our management frequently evaluates our manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and sales locations to identify revenue enhancement opportunities, optimize production costs and ensure proximity to key customers.
Growth Strategies
We are focused on delivering long-term profitable growth through a number of avenues. Our growth initiatives are developed based on strategic plans conducted on an annual basis within each of our businesses. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated by our leadership team. As a result, we have a uniform strategy that focuses all of our resources on the following key initiatives:
Margin Growth
We are focused on continuous improvement in our profit margins through the development of higher-margin products, continued operational improvements and active product portfolio management. We anticipate our strategy of shifting toward innovative higher-value engineered products will continue to improve our pricing power and profitability. Among other initiatives, we are focused on redesigning products to reduce material costs, continuing to reduce labor-intensive manufacturing processes and reducing logistics costs, which have traditionally been a significant component of overall costs and an important consideration when choosing our strategic manufacturing locations.
We are focused on creating operational effectiveness at each of our business segments through deployment of lean principles and implementation of continuous operational improvement initiatives. While many of these activities have focused on implementing shop floor improvements, we have also targeted our selling and administrative functions in order to reduce the cost of serving our customers. We are also focused on improving profitability through an active evaluation of customer pricing and margins and a reduction in the number of parts and product variations that are produced. While these initiatives may result in lower overall sales, they are focused on creating shareholder value through higher margins and profitability, diversification, as well as lower inventory levels and working capital requirements.
We continuously evaluate our manufacturing footprint and utilization of manufacturing capacity. In recent years, we have completed or announced the consolidation of manufacturing facilities across our businesses. Reduction of fixed costs through optimization of manufacturing footprint and capacity will continue to be a driver of margin expansion and improving profitability.
Market Share Gains
While our businesses pursue growth within new and existing markets through customized strategies targeted for the markets we serve, they also are tasked with identifying and pursuing key growth opportunities through new products, geographies, sales channels and diversifying end markets served. Management believes we have the potential to increase market share due to the highly fragmented nature of our end markets. Each business has identified specific opportunities to expand market share, with associated incremental revenue targets.
Product Innovation
Management believes that our strategy of developing innovative products will position us for continued growth. Working in collaboration with key customers, the design and manufacture of customized products that deliver value will support this growth. We believe that developing new products will allow us to deepen our value-added relationships with customers, open new opportunities for revenue generation, improve pricing power and enhance profitability. We have a focused and dedicated strategy for continuous innovation, which is supported by sophisticated manufacturing capabilities and engineering expertise. Research and development costs from continuing operations incurred in the development of new products or significant improvements to existing products were $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 and $3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This continued focus on innovation has driven successful new product introductions, which we believe will enable continued growth.
Acquisitions
We use acquisitions to increase revenues with existing customers and to expand revenues to both new markets and customers. We intend to pursue acquisitions that are accretive to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins post-synergies, have a strategic focus that aligns with our core strategy and generate the appropriate estimated return on investment as part of our capital resource and allocation process. On April 1, 2019, we acquired Schaffner Manufacturing Company, Inc., which expanded our polishing product line offerings within North America in the industrial segment.
Customers
We have an entrenched base of blue chip customers that are leaders in their respective markets. Our customer relationships often span decades in each business. Additionally, our customer base is diversified. In our industrial segment, no customers were at or above 10% of the revenue of such segment. In our engineered components segment, two customers were at or above 10% of the revenues of such segment. No customers were at or above 10% of consolidated 2019, 2018 or 2017 revenues. In 2019, our five largest customers represented a combined 23% of 2019 revenues.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Polyurethane foam, vinyl, plastics, steel, cloth, steel wire, and abrasive grains are the primary raw materials that we use to manufacture our products. There are a limited number of domestic and foreign suppliers of these raw materials. We generally order supplies on a purchase order basis and generally incur inbound freight charges to transport the raw materials to our production facilities. Although our contracts and long term arrangements with our customers generally do not expressly allow us to pass through increases in our raw materials, energy costs, freight charges and other inputs, we endeavor to discuss price adjustments with our customers on a case by case basis where it makes business sense. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the spend with our top three material suppliers accounted for 11% of total material spend and our largest supplier accounted for approximately 5% of total spend. We make an ongoing effort to reduce and contain raw material costs. We do not engage in raw material commodity hedging contracts, and instead attempt to reflect raw material price changes in the sale price of our products.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality of demand for our products in the engineered components segment. Due to our experience in this market, we have adapted our business operations to manage this seasonality. We also depend upon general economic conditions and other market factors beyond our control, and we serve customers in cyclical industries. See “Seasonality and Working Capital” in the accompanying “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein for further discussion.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,940 employees and manufactured products in 23 locations around the world. Contracts are negotiated on a local basis, significantly mitigating the risk of a company-wide or segment level work stoppage. We have approximately 235 unionized hourly employees in the United States. Additionally, approximately 730 of our employees reside in Europe where local works councils with collective bargaining or other similar agreements are common and approximately 370 of our employees reside in Mexico where collective bargaining agreements are common. We believe we have a strong relationship with our employees, including those represented by labor unions.
Environmental Matters
Our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health, safety and natural resources, including those governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to water, the use, generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and other materials and the remediation of contaminated sites. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and a failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, or to obtain and comply with the permits required for its operations, could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the capital or operating costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Moreover, if applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, become more stringent in the future, we could incur capital or operating costs beyond those currently anticipated.
Compliance with environmental laws has not historically had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we anticipate that such compliance will not have a material effect on our business or financial condition in the future.
