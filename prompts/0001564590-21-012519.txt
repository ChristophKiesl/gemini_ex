Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Sientra, Inc. (“Sientra”, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a medical aesthetics company uniquely centered on becoming the leader of transformative treatments and technologies focused on progressing the art of plastic surgery. We were founded to provide greater choices to board certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants in the U.S. for augmentation procedures exclusively to board certified and board admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loyalty and confidence. In 2020, we also began to sell our breast implants in Japan through a distributor partner. We sell our breast tissue expanders for reconstruction procedures predominantly to hospitals and surgery centers, and our BIOCORNEUM scar management products to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other specialties.
 On June 11, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with miraDry (formerly Miramar Labs) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of miraDry’s common stock. Pursuant to the transaction, which closed on July 25, 2017 we added the miraDry System, the only FDA-cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors to our aesthetics portfolio. Following our acquisition of miraDry in July 2017, we began selling the miraDry System, consisting of a console and a handheld device, and consumable single-use bioTips. 
 As a result of the miraDry acquisition, we determined that we conduct our business in two operating segments: Breast Products and miraDry. The Breast Products segment focuses on sales of our breast implants, tissue expanders, and scar management products. The miraDry segment focuses on sales of the miraDry System and bioTips.
 We sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 67 employees including 8 sales managers. Additionally, we also sell our miraDry products in several international markets where we leverage distributor relationships supported by 6 sales representatives. 
 We commenced sales of our breast implants in the United States in the second quarter of 2012. Our Breast Products segment net sales were $55.0 million, $46.4 million, and $37.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. For our miraDry segment, we generate revenues from sales of our miraDry System and from the sales of bioTips which are required for use for each miraDry procedure performed. We generated net sales of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Recent developments
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the non-essential healthcare industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and could lead to a global recession. We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, manufacturing, and employee-related amounts, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We continue to monitor and assess new information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets.

As an aesthetics company, surgical procedures involving our breast and miraDry products are susceptible to local and national government restrictions, such as social distancing, “shelter in place” orders and business closures, due to the economic and logistical impacts these measures have on consumer demand as well as the practitioners’ ability to administer such procedures. The inability or limited ability to perform such non-emergency procedures significantly harmed our revenues during the second quarter of 2020 and continued to harm our revenues during the third and fourth quarter of 2020. While some states have lifted certain restrictions on non-emergency procedures, we will likely continue to experience future harm to our revenues while existing or new restrictions remain in place.
 Further, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by governments. In addition, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that this can lead to a local and/or global economic recession, which may result in further harm to the aesthetics market. Such economic disruption could adversely affect our business. The continued spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and personnel. Further, trade and/or national security protection policies may be adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as actions by governments that limit, restrict or prevent the movement of certain goods into a country and/or region, and current U.S./China trade relations may be further exacerbated by the pandemic.
 The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining the collectability of accounts receivable, fair value of long-lived assets and goodwill, and sales returns liability required could be impacted by the pandemic. While the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown at this time, we have made appropriate estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained.
 Change in miraDry business strategy
 In April 2020, in part as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we re-focused our miraDry business to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will account for substantially all of our miraDry segment’s net sales for the next several years. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated our separate miraDry U.S. salesforce and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team. 
 Restructuring
 In November 2019, the Board of Directors approved an organizational efficiency initiative (the “Plan”) designed to reduce spending and simplify operations. Under the Plan, we implemented numerous initiatives to reduce spending, including closing the Santa Clara offices of miraDry, Inc. and consolidating a number of business support services via a shared services organization at our Santa Barbara headquarters. Under the Plan, we reduced our workforce by terminating approximately 60 employees, which was completed as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” and Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our organizational efficiency initiative.
Our Market
 The global market for aesthetic procedures is significant. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS, estimates that U.S. consumers spent approximately $17 billion on approximately eighteen million cosmetic procedures in 2019, including both surgical and non-invasive cosmetic treatments.
 Breast Products
 Breast augmentation surgery remains the leading aesthetic surgical procedure by dollars and number of procedures in the United States. According to the Aesthetic Society, over 280,000 primary breast augmentation procedures were performed in the United States in 2019. Based on the number of procedures reported by the Aesthetic Society and ASPS and our estimates of average selling price, implant mix and implants per procedure, we estimate the global 
 7


breast market to be approximately $1.5 billion, with the currently addressable market for our currently available breast products at approximately $600 million in the U.S. 
 In the U.S., we sell our breast implants used for augmentation procedures exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons, as determined by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, who we refer to as Plastic Surgeons. These surgeons have completed the extensive multi-year plastic surgery residency training required by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. While aesthetic procedures are performed by a wide range of medical professionals, including dermatologists, otolaryngologists, obstetricians, gynecologists, dentists and other specialists, the majority of aesthetic surgical procedures are performed by Plastic Surgeons. Plastic Surgeons are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. According to the American Board of Plastic Surgery, there are approximately 7,000 board certified plastic surgeons actively practicing in the United States. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are sold predominantly to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures.
 miraDry
 
Laser and light-based hair removal continue to be the largest volume among non-surgical and non-injectable aesthetic procedures. As an emerging market, energy-based procedures for sweat and odor reduction are not currently tracked by the Aesthetic Society’s data. No one treatment procedure is offered by all physicians, and treatments vary in terms of the treatment goal and desired effect. As a result, the total aesthetic market as reported by the Aesthetic Society does not represent the market potential for miraDry or any other single product or treatment, but illustrates that each year patients elect to have millions of aesthetic procedures. We believe several factors are contributing to the ongoing growth in aesthetic procedures, including:
 
 
• | Broader availability of safe non-surgical aesthetic procedures. Technological developments have resulted in the introduction of a broader range of safe, non-surgical aesthetic procedures. According to the Aesthetic Society, non-surgical aesthetic treatments are growing faster than invasive surgical procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased physician focus on aesthetic procedures. We believe increased restrictions imposed by managed care and government agencies on reimbursement for medical treatments are motivating our customers to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices, which generally consist of procedures paid for directly by patients. We expect this trend to continue as our customers look for ways to expand their practices and improve profitability.

Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition of varying degree in which a person sweats excessively. The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is significant. A study published by Strutton et al. in the June 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, or AAD, titled “U.S. prevalence of hyperhidrosis and impact on individuals with axillary hyperhidrosis: Results from a national survey,” estimated that 2.8% of the general population has hyperhidrosis (in this study defined as excessive or abnormal sweating) with 50.8% thereof having axillary hyperhidrosis. Additionally, the general consensus of medical practitioners is that the definition of hyperhidrosis includes anyone who is bothered by their sweat. As such, the definition of hyperhidrosis is broad in scope and the condition depends upon whether patients have determined that their sweating is excessive or abnormal. Because this assessment is subjectively determined by the patients themselves, there is no quantifiable standard that medical practitioners use to determine whether a patient is suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis. If patients subjectively determine that their underarm sweating is excessive and as such are bothered by their sweating, such patients are considered to be suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis.
 
In 2017, we commissioned a survey of over 2,000 consumers, evaluating several criteria including sweat-bothered, dissatisfaction with current treatment, interest in a non-surgical long-term solution, and interest in the miraDry product description. Based on this survey, we believe there are approximately 37 million people in the U.S. alone that are bothered by sweat, dissatisfied with their current treatment and/or have an interest in seeking a long-term solution, and that approximately 15 million people would be interested in our miraDry solution. Based on this survey and our average selling price per bioTip, we estimate the size of our addressable consumables market to be approximately $6 billion in the U.S. Further, based on this survey, our estimates of the number of aesthetic practices in the U.S., the indicated number of people interested in a miraDry solution and our average selling price per 
 8


miraDry console, we estimate the size of our addressable equipment market to be approximately $1.4 billion on a global basis, with the size of our addressable U.S. market estimated at approximately $700 million.
 
Our Opportunity
 Breast Products
 We believe a significant opportunity exists in the U.S. marketplace due to the high barriers to entry in the U.S. breast implant market and the historical lack of product and service innovation for Plastic Surgeons.
 For more than 20 years prior to the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012, only two companies manufactured and distributed breast implants in the United States. We believe that this market concentration is largely a result of the considerable costs and risks associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process required by the FDA, which has created a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. breast implant market. All new breast implants require PMA approval from the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. The PMA application process is lengthy and uncertain, and it must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires long‑term follow‑up of a large number of enrolled patients, as well as extensive pre‑clinical, clinical and other product data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Due to the lengthy and uncertain PMA approval process, we believe that in the near term, it is likely that the companies currently providing silicone gel breast implants in the United States will continue to be the only companies servicing the U.S. silicone breast implant market.
 We believe the rigorous FDA approval process and the existence of only two competitors in the U.S. market have historically contributed to a lack of technological innovation in the U.S. breast implant industry resulting in limited product choices. Until the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012, surgeons in the United States were only able to purchase basic round breast implants from our two U.S. competitors, while surgeons outside of the United States were able to purchase technologically‑advanced round and anatomically‑shaped breast implants.
 miraDry
 The miraDry procedure addresses a large underpenetrated market in the non-surgical, lifestyle aesthetics category. The miraDry treatment is the first and only FDA-cleared solution to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors with as little as one 60-minute treatment, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with alternative treatment options. The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed through targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve their desired results. Due to these advantages, we believe that the miraDry treatment is appealing to a wide range of individuals seeking a lasting solution to underarm sweat.
 The miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal underarm sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature and reduction of underarm hair. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities afforded by current market dynamics. By focusing on products with technologically differentiated characteristics, demonstrating strong clinical data, offering more product choices and providing services tailored specifically to the needs of physicians, we believe we can enhance our position in the market. Our competitive strengths include:
 Proven and experienced leadership team. We have a highly experienced management team at both the corporate and operational levels with significant experience in the medical aesthetics industry. Members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the medical aesthetics industry.

Breast Products
 Differentiated technologies. We incorporate differentiated technologies into our proprietary breast implants to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, including our silicone shell, High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel and a microtextured surface. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our products. In addition, the microtexturing on Sientra’s implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. Our proprietary Allox2 tissue expander with its patented dual port and integral drain technology, is the only tissue expander that provides surgeons access to the periprosthetic space. The Allox2 tissue expander is clinically shown to improve expander salvage rates and outcomes and has a 100% surgeon satisfaction based on a recent case study. In another clinical study with 31 primary reconstruction patients, the Allox2 was noted as successful in treating seromas and recommended as a tool for noninvasive treatment of common complications of tissue expander based reconstruction.
 Strong clinical trial outcomes. Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants. Our breast implants were approved by the FDA based on data we collected from our long-term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States. The clinical data we collected over a ten-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, based on our competitors’ published ten-year data.
 Innovative services that deliver an improved customer experience. Our customer service offerings are intended to accommodate and anticipate the needs of our Plastic Surgeons so they can focus on providing better services to their patients. On April 25, 2018, we announced our new Sientra Platinum20 Warranty, which we believe provides an industry leading policy of no-charge replacement implants, as well as financial assistance, for certain qualifying events occurring within twenty years of the initial procedure. We also offer specialized educational initiatives and a streamlined ordering, shipping and billing process. For sales prior to May 1, 2018, we provided an industry-leading ten-year limited warranty that provides patients with a cash reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event, a lifetime no-charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures, and our industry-first C3 Program through which we offer no-charge replacement implants to breast augmentation patients who experience capsular contracture within the first five years after implantation with our smooth or textured breast implants.
 Board-certified plastic surgeon focus. We sell our breast implants for augmentation procedures exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons, or Plastic Surgeons, who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are predominantly sold to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings. We believe that securing the loyalty and confidence of Plastic Surgeons is essential to our success and that our association with Plastic Surgeons enhances our credibility and aligns with our focus on making a difference in patients’ lives.
 miraDry
 Strong clinical trial outcomes. The miraDry System is the only FDA-cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors. Clinical studies involving more than 150 patients have shown that one or two miraDry procedures can noticeably and measurably reduce the amount of sweat from the axilla, or underarm. In our study involving 120 subjects, 89% of patients that received treatment experienced reduction in their sweat with no reported deaths, injuries requiring immediate medical attention to prevent death, or permanent impairment. In a second study involving 31 patients, patients reported an average of 82% sweat reduction at 12 months and 100% of patients reported an improvement in their Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, or HDSS, score at 24 months, with all patients reporting their sweating as either never noticeable or tolerable. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting.
 Patient satisfaction. miraDry allows most patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with more invasive procedures for sweat, odor and hair reduction. In addition, unlike many other non-surgical procedures, patients are not required to undergo multiple or recurring treatment procedures to obtain aesthetic results. According to RealSelf.com, a leading online community helping people make confident choices in elective cosmetic procedures, as of February 26, 2021, the miraDry procedure has received a 88% all-time “worth it” rating from patients.
 10


Reproducible results. The miraDry procedure requires limited training and skill to obtain successful aesthetic results. The miraDry System was designed to be easy to operate and largely automated, resulting in a more consistent application and reproducible results.
 Differentiated, high-value product for physician practices. Our selective distribution strategy was designed to enable our customers to market miraDry as a highly differentiated, non-surgical sweat, odor, and hair reduction procedure. Based on our commercial data and customer experiences, we have seen attractive economic benefits for our customers.
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to become a leading provider of differentiated medical aesthetic products and services tailored to meet the needs of plastic surgeons, allowing us to deliver on our commitment to enhance and make a difference in patients’ lives. To achieve our objective, we are pursuing the following business strategies:
 Create awareness of our differentiated technologies, products and services with Plastic Surgeons and consumers. Since we commenced commercial operations, we have focused most of our marketing efforts on Plastic Surgeons to promote and create awareness of the benefits of our products. Among other marketing programs targeted at Plastic Surgeons, we offer educational initiatives exclusively to Plastic Surgeons through our Sientra Education Forums, and we have continued our consumer-directed efforts. We believe that continuing to invest in expanding marketing initiatives will have a positive impact on our business.
 Selectively pursue acquisitions and expand into new markets. We may continue to selectively pursue domestic and international acquisitions of businesses or technologies that may allow us to leverage our relationships with Plastic Surgeons and our existing commercial infrastructure to provide us with new or complementary products or technologies, and allow us to compete in new geographic markets or market segments or to increase our market share. For example, we began selling BIOCORNEUM directly to physicians in the United States after we acquired the rights to do so, in addition to rights relating to certain other specified sales channels from Enaltus in March 2016. We began selling the AlloX2 and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, and the Softspan line of general tissue expanders, after we acquired these product lines from SSP in November 2016. We began selling the miraDry System and bioTips after the acquisition of miraDry in July 2017.
 Broaden our product portfolio and launch new products and services. We plan to continue to develop products that address the unmet needs of physicians and patients by leveraging our innovative technologies in combination with our regulatory and product development expertise. We have a number of new breast implants and tissue expanders under development with different characteristics and configurations. We believe these expanded product choices will allow Plastic Surgeons to potentially achieve better outcomes for their patients. In addition, we plan to take advantage of cross selling and product bundling opportunities.
 Highly optimized, experienced and fully trained sales force. We historically maintained separate North American sales forces within our Breast Products and miraDry segments. Our Breast Products sales force primarily consists of Plastic Surgery Consultants, or PSCs, focused on selling our Breast Products exclusively to board-certified and board-admissible plastic surgeons, Reconstruction Clinical Managers or RCMs who are responsible for the sales and growth of the breast reconstruction portfolio of products in hospitals and surgery centers, and our ENHANCE Practice Development team responsible for practice efficiencies and education. Our miraDry sales force consists of Business Managers or BMs who focus on system sales and consumable bioTip sales. On December 31, 2020, we eliminated the miraDry BM sales team and transitioned miraDry sales responsibility into the Breast Products ENHANCE Practice Development team. We have continued to retain high quality, experienced sales representatives and sales management personnel in all categories and train the sales organization to optimize performance in their respective roles. We believe our sales force will continue to generate increased customer adoption and patient awareness momentum in the marketplace.
 Invest in clinical studies and peer reviewed articles with key opinion leaders. We intend to continue to invest in clinical studies in order to provide published peer reviewed articles that support the clinical benefits of our products and technologies over those of our competitors. We believe our relationship with Plastic Surgeons and our continued 
 11


focus on providing differentiated products and services will allow us to leverage our existing capabilities to increase our share of the breast implant market specifically and the medical aesthetics market generally.
 Increase our international presence. There is strong global demand for aesthetic procedures outside of North America. We intend to increase our market penetration outside of North America and build global brand recognition. In 2020, we received regulatory approval to market the entire line of Sientra breast implants in Japan. We may seek regulatory approval to market Breast Products in additional international markets. 
 Our Products
 Our portfolio of products has been specifically tailored to meet the needs of the physicians we serve. We believe that our broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics enable physicians to deliver better outcomes for their patients.
Breast Products
 Our primary products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in approximately 350 variations of shapes, sizes, fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective augmentation procedures that are generally performed on a cash-pay basis. Many of our proprietary breast implants incorporate one or more technologies that differentiate us from our competitors, including High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel and shell texturing. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the silicone shell and High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our implants. The texturing on Sientra’s implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. Our tissue expanders are primarily used in non-elective breast reconstruction procedures. Our Allox2 tissue expanders have a unique dual port and integral drain that permits access to periprosthetic space for less invasive draining of serous fluid, while our Dermaspan tissue expanders are uniquely designed for a gentle and more comfortable expansion.
 In addition, since 2016, we have offered BIOCORNEUM, an advanced silicone scar treatment, directly to physicians, surgeons, and dermatologists. 
 We sell our breast implants for augmentation procedures exclusively to Plastic Surgeons, who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. Our tissue expanders which are used in breast reconstruction procedures are predominantly sold to hospitals and surgery centers who determine the admission privileges of surgeons performing breast reconstruction procedures. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings, and a twenty-year limited warranty that provides patients with cash reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event, a lifetime no-charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures, and the industry’s first policy of no-charge replacement implants to patients who experience covered capsular contracture, double capsule and late-forming seroma events within twenty years of the initial implant procedure.
 miraDry
 In July 2017, we completed our acquisition of miraDry, following which we began selling the miraDry System, the only FDA cleared device indicated to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors through the precise and non-surgical delivery of microwave energy to the region where sweat glands reside. The energy generates heat at the dermal-fat interface which results in destruction of the sweat glands. At the same time, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the dermal-fat interface where the sweat glands reside. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting. Microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the dermal-fat interface where the glands reside.
 The miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature, plus unwanted underarm hair removal, and permanent reduction of underarm hair of all colors for 
 12


Fitzpatrick skin types I – IV. Permanent hair reduction is defined as long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing when measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after the completion of a treatment regime. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. 
 The miraDry System provides patients with a non-surgical and durable procedure to selectively destroy underarm sweat glands for both severely hyperhidrotic patients and those that are bothered by their underarm sweat. The miraDry System has been evaluated in clinical studies, which showed that the system reduced sweat in one or more procedures of approximately 60-minutes, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with alternative treatment options. The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed through targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting in most patients, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve their desired results.
 The miraDry System consists of a console and a handheld device which uses consumable single-use bioTips. The miraDry procedure is not technique-dependent, does not require significant training or skill for the healthcare provider, and the user-interface guides the provider through each step of the procedure for each treatment. We sell our miraDry System and consumable single-use bioTips only to physicians, consisting of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and physicians specializing in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Aesthetic specialists are physicians who elect to offer aesthetic procedures as a significant part of their practices but are generally not board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Physicians can market the miraDry procedure as a premium, highly-differentiated, non-surgical sweat reduction procedure. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.
 Our Technology
 Breast Products
 Our current portfolio of breast implants utilizes what we believe are the most advanced technologies currently available on the market. These technologies are supported by rigorous product testing, analytics and clinical data. The advanced technologies in our products include:
 High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel.  Our HSC and HSC+ breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our products. The use of High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel in our HSC and HSC+ breast implants in conjunction with our silicone shell allows the breast implants to hold a controlled shape while maintaining a soft feel.
 The silicone material used in our breast implants has been designed to provide the characteristics desired by Plastic Surgeons for breast implants. At present, we are the only company in the United States that has received FDA approval to use High Strength Cohesive silicone gel in breast implants.
 We have completed a number of studies conducted by independent laboratories to demonstrate the competitive advantages of using High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel in our breast implants. We believe this technology differentiates our breast implants for the following reasons:
  
• | our implant gel is stronger, which is evidenced by its resistance to gel fracture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | due to the unique relationship between our implant gel and our implant shells, our implants have an enhanced ability to retain their shape without sacrificing the desired softness; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our shaped implants are softer and more elastic than our competitors’ shaped implants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13



We believe the beneficial properties of our implants arise from the characteristics of the gel, as well as the integration of the gel with our implant shell. Inside each of our implants, the gel adheres to the shell, creating additional structural strength and shape retention in the implant. This results in the ability to deliver strength and shaping capability without a stiffer gel or implant and without sacrificing the desired softness. We typically evaluate these characteristics using the following metrics:
  
• | Peel‑force. Peel‑force is measured by the amount of force, measured in pound‑force, or lbf, necessary to separate the outer shell of the implant from the internal gel filling. A greater peel‑force measurement indicates greater gel‑shell integration. In the case of anatomically‑shaped implants, greater peel‑force can also be an indication of the ability of the implant to retain its shape, particularly the upper portions of the implant, also referred to as the upper pole. Upper pole stability is of particular importance in preserving the desired anatomical shape of an implant over time. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gel strength. Gel strength is measured by the amount of force, measured in lbf, required to cause permanent fractures in the gel. A larger value indicates greater strength. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gel elasticity and implant elasticity. Gel elasticity and implant elasticity can be measured by the level of resistance, measured in millimeters, or mm, to an applied constant force. A higher value represents greater softness and a lower deformation value represents greater firmness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sientra’s Implant Texture.  We sell breast implants that are available with a smooth outer surface or a microtextured outer surface. We believe our microtextured breast implants offer us clinical advantages over our competitors’ textured products, including:
 
• | better tissue adherence to reduce the incidence of malposition and rotation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduction in the rate of capsular contracture, a complication in which the patient’s body creates a scar‑tissue capsule around the implant that can tighten and squeeze the implant potentially causing discomfort, pain and even dislocation of the implant. While we have neither sought nor obtained FDA approval to state that our breast implants reduces the incidence of capsular contracture, we believe it may significantly reduce this risk, as evidenced by the lower rates of capsular contraction reported over a ten‑year follow‑up period in our clinical trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On a breast implant, the desired texture should have a proportionate amount of surface disruption, as overly aggressive texture can result in double‑capsule formation while not enough texturing can result in a lack of adherence resulting in malposition or rotation. We believe that our microtextured implants have the right combination of surface disruption without overly aggressive texturing.
 By incorporating High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel and our texturing into our breast implants, we believe we have a competitive advantage in marketing and differentiating our products to Plastic Surgeons.
 Innovative Tissue Expanders. We believe that we offer the industry’s leading tissue expander portfolio that offers meaningful clinical and economic benefits to our customers. Our Dermaspan tissue expanders are designed with a soft, pliable shell and without ridges or rings to provide for gentle and more comfortable expansion for patients.  Our Allox2 tissue expanders have a patented dual port and integral drain technology and are the only tissue expanders that provide surgeons access to the periprosthetic space. We believe that the Allox2 tissue expander offers clinical and economic advantages over our competitor’s offerings that provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, including:

• | The Allox2 tissue expander provides access to the periprosthetic space where fluid can accumulate allowing for the non-invasive treatment of seromas which has been clinically shown to improve expander salvage rates and outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 miraDry
 miraDry Technology. Our technology platform utilizes microwave energy to create heat within the skin or subcutaneous locations to create a therapeutic effect. Microwave energy has been used in various medical specialties for heating tissue for decades. In the dermatologic field, it is important that heating is confined to a very precise location, which the miraDry technology platform is designed to do. Due to its proprietary handpiece designs, when used with appropriate energy parameters, the miraDry System can heat dermatologic tissue in a precise and controlled manner.
 
Our miraDry System utilizes microwave energy to deliver heat to the location of the skin where most underarm sweat glands reside – at or just below the skin-fat interface. We designed a proprietary handpiece that automatically focuses the energy at the skin-fat interface, regardless of skin thickness. When the physician or medical professional places the handpiece to a specific area of the underarm as instructed by the graphic user interface, the energy is delivered automatically to the target tissue. The heat generated in the tissue exceeds the threshold for cellular necrosis, thereby ablating the sweat glands where the energy is focused.  Surface cooling prevents the heat from damaging the superficial tissue above the skin-fat interface. In the underarm, many of the hair follicles are in the same relative location as the sweat glands. Therefore, the heating will also cause destruction and elimination of the hair follicles in those areas.
 Our miraDry treatment has been clinically demonstrated to reduce sweat and hair from the underarm without causing injury to critical surrounding structures. The surface cooling protects the epidermis and the majority of the dermis from damaging heat. The deeper underlying structures are protected by two mechanisms. First, our anesthesia protocol calls for creating a distance barrier between the underlying structures and the surface of the skin where the handpiece is positioned. A significant volume of anesthesia fluid is administered between the skin (and target tissue) and the underlying structures, which causes a separation of the target tissue from the underlying structure. As the handpiece is positioned just outside the skin, the underlying structures are further away from the handpiece, keeping them safe from damaging heat. Second, we employ a vacuum suction system in the handpiece where the skin is pulled up into a vacuum chamber within the handpiece. Typically, the underlying structures either remain stationary or move slightly with the vacuum action, thereby creating further distance between the handpiece and the underlying structures.
 Our Clinical Data
 Breast Products
 In 2012, our breast implants were approved by the FDA based on data we collected from our long‑term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants and provide Plastic Surgeons and their patients the security and confidence to choose our products. 
 Our 10-year breast implant clinical trial, which has been completed, is the largest prospective, long‑term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and included the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the long-term clinical trial were subject to serial MRI screening as part of the clinical protocol. The clinical data we collected over a ten‑year follow‑up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. An additional large prospective Post Approval Study, or PAS, is being conducted on our breast implants. The PAS is a newly enrolled U.S. cohort study designed to evaluate long-term clinical performance under general conditions in 
 15


the postmarket environment (i.e., “real-world” study). The study involves 5,197 Sientra patients and 301 control patients followed annually for 10 years. We received a Warning Letter from FDA, dated March 19, 2019, relating to the Company’s failure to meet the FDA-approved minimum retention rate for this PAS. We responded to this Warning Letter and are in continued dialogue with FDA to fully address our study’s participant retention, including patient questionnaire completion and additional follow-up office visits.
 In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States, which involved annual postoperative follow-up for five years. We have also commissioned a number of bench trials run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors.
 We and our two U.S. competitors were required to run independent ten‑year clinical studies to obtain PMA approval from the FDA. Our clinical study was not designed to facilitate head‑to‑head comparisons.  However, our clinical data and our competitors’ clinical data are publicly available to both surgeons and patients who are able to use such data to compare and contrast competing implants.
 Our tissue expanders have a favorable clinical profile compared to our competitors. In a retrospective clinical study of 112 patients, involving 173 devices with 43.7% of the devices used being the Allox2 tissue expander, the authors reported successfully treating all seromas occurring with the Allox2 tissue expander using the integrated drain port.  The authors also reported successfully salvaging the Allox2 tissue expander in a patient presenting with an infection through diagnostic sampling of fluid obtained via the integrated drain port, and subsequent antibiotic treatment via the integrated drain port. In another clinical review of 31 reconstruction patients treated with the Allox2 tissue expander, the authors reported that the Allox2 was successful in salvaging the Allox2 tissue expander in 2 out of 3 patients presenting with postoperative infections, with the authors reporting on the use of the integrated drain port to allow minimally invasive diagnostic fluid sampling followed by targeted antibiotic therapy. In a further clinical review of 99 breast reconstructions with Allox2 tissue expanders (n=59) and a conventional competitive tissue expander (n=40), the authors reported lower overall complication rates with Allox2 tissue expanders (23.5% vs. 41.7%), and successful salvage of 60% of cases presenting with postoperative infections with the Allox2 tissue expander compared to zero salvaged cases with the competitive tissue expander.
 miraDry
 
Our DRI-UP clinical trial, conducted as an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption study, involved 120 subjects. The results of the study indicated that subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis receiving treatment for the reduction of axillary sweat using the miraDry System had a success rate of 89% as compared to the control group success rate of 54%, with no serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects reported.
 
A second study on the long-term effect of the miraDry System showed all patients who participated in this study reported being no longer bothered by their hyperhidrosis at 24 months, with no serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse side effects.
 
A third, single center study designed to quantify the amount of odor reduction in the axillae after treatment(s) with the miraDry System treated 36 subjects with a miraDry treatment with follow-up visits at 1-month, 3-month and 6-month intervals after treatment.  The study data did not show a statistically significant majority of treated subjects having at least a two-point lower malodor score (scale of 0 to 10), but did show a statistically significant average malodor score difference between the treated and untreated axilla using both quantitative odor judges’ scores as well as patients’ subjective self-reported odor severity score (scale of 1 to 10).

miraDry
 
Our miraDry customer service policies have been designed to meet the needs of both physicians and distributors, including:
  
• | In the event of a technical issue with a miraDry System in North America, one of our customer service personnel will call the physician and determine whether the technical issue may be resolved over the telephone or whether the issue requires an intervention. If the issue cannot be resolved by telephone, our customer service personnel will request our third-party logistics provider to visit the physician and provide on-site technical support. If the service provider determines that a replacement system is required, our logistics provider will deliver the replacement miraDry System or module into the physician’s office, set it up and ensure that the miraDry System is working properly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In most markets outside of North America, our miraDry System is serviced and supported through our independent distributors and certified third-party service providers. We require our distributors to maintain adequate inventory of miraDry Systems and components to facilitate quick response time to service events and to maximize customer “up time.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We provide a standard one year warranty on our miraDry Systems in the U.S. In addition to these product warranties, we have offered extended service agreements to our customers to provide protection of their system and handpiece against breakage. However, we do not obtain a material portion of our revenue from our service contracts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Educational and Marketing Initiatives
Breast Products
 We have implemented educational and marketing initiatives with a focus on both Plastic Surgeons and their patients considering breast augmentation or reconstruction.
 Plastic Surgeons.  In order to educate Plastic Surgeons about our product lines, we provide a variety of education programs for Plastic Surgeons under the banner of the Sientra Education Forum. To date:

• | We host symposia with one or more key‑note speakers who speak on topics ranging from our corporate identity and customer service offerings to surgical tips and suggestions from thought‑leading Plastic Surgeons.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We sponsor educational surgical preceptorships where a small group of Plastic Surgeons are able to observe a live surgery conducted by one of our trained preceptors and train with that preceptor.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We provide an educational series in Practice Management for Plastic Surgeons in the form of ENHANCE Webinars and Consulting, to provide them with insights and expertise on how to market and run their practices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patients.  We have been engaging directly with consumers who are considering breast augmentation or reconstruction. We initially focused our consumer educational and marketing activities on websites where consumers come to research their breast augmentation or reconstruction options, including:

• | Our own consumer website, branded with our “See Yourself in Sientra” campaign, that provides resources for consumers considering breast augmentation or reconstruction, including a Surgeon locator, product descriptions, patient planning guides and educational brochures and information regarding our warranty and C3 programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our social media profiles, educating those interested in breast augmentation, breast reconstruction and scar treatment through Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 We sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 67 employees including 8 sales managers. Additionally, we leverage distributor relationships to sell our breast implants in Japan and miraDry products in several international markets supported by 6 sales representatives. 
 18



We require our international distributors to provide ongoing training and support of their physician customers and invest in the marketing support of practices to expand the market and demand for the miraDry System for physicians and patients. Our distribution agreements generally provide the exclusive right to distribute our products within a designated territory.
 
In addition, our marketing team leads our efforts in brand development, trade show attendance, educational forums, product messaging, website development and advertising, among others.
 Research and Development
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were approximately $10.3 million, $13.5 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The addition of miraDry added $1.6 million, $4.4 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our Breast Products segment research and development is focused on enhancing and improving our breast products and tissue expanders, increasing our breast implant portfolio, product development related activities and expanding into synergistic markets. 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 Breast Products
 We hold FDA Medical Device Establishment Registrations for both our location in Santa Barbara and our manufacturing facility in Franklin, Wisconsin.  All of our medical device products are listed under our Device Listing where it indicates we are the specification developer and manufacturer of our products, and except for our inflatable breast implant sizers, we are the owner of our products’ FDA approvals and clearances. This means that we are primarily responsible for the design, manufacturing and quality assurance of our products. While we manufacture our breast implants and their corresponding silicone gel breast implant sizers in our Franklin, Wisconsin facility, we do not manufacture our tissue expanders ourselves. Instead, we rely on our third-party manufacturer to manufacture and package our tissue expanders to our specifications. When we receive our tissue expanders from our third-party manufacturer, we inspect a representative sample of packaging and labeling prior to shipping them to our customers. We typically maintain strategic levels of inventory at our storage facilities located in Santa Barbara, California and our manufacturing plant in Franklin, Wisconsin.
 We, along with our third-party manufacturer are subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, reporting requirements and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, audits by the FDA. Under the QSR and cGMP requirements, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, must follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. The FDA has inspected both the Company and our suppliers. The Company has never been the subject of any manufacturing related 483 Observations or Warning Letters, or any other FDA assertions that we are in violation of the FDCA, as it pertains to our Breast Products.
 We have obtained the following international Quality System and Regulatory certifications for breast implants and tissue expanders: ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Regulatory Purposes, and the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP), representing conformance to 21 CFR 820, 21 CFR 803, 21 CFR 806, 21 CFR 807 (Subparts A through D) and Canadian Medical Devices Regulations – Part 1 - SOR-98/282, positioning us to register our breast implants and tissue expanders in Canada and other international markets. The Company is regularly audited by an accredited Registrar to assess the Company’s continued compliance with ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP Quality System and Regulatory requirements. In August 2020, the Company received approval from Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PDMA) to market the Company’s silicone gel breast implants.
 19


In March 2017, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Vesta for the manufacture and supply of our breast implants and submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta. In January 2018, the FDA granted approval of the site-change PMA supplement for Vesta to manufacture our silicone gel breast implants and approved three (3) process enhancement filings, the last of which was approved in April 2018. On November 7, 2019, we acquired the Vesta manufacturing operations, providing us with a fully operational Class 3 breast implant manufacturing operation.
 
miraDry
 We occupy an approximately 29,000 square foot facility located in Santa Clara, California dedicated to the manufacture, distribution, and servicing of miraDry Systems and accessories.
 All final assembly, calibration and testing of our miraDry Systems are performed at our Santa Clara facility. The consumable bioTip is manufactured by a contract manufacturer, Healthcare Technology International Limited (HTI), at their facility in Dongguan, China. Consumables undergo final configuration and are tested and packaged at our Santa Clara facility.
 A critical component of our miraDry System is the custom microwave power amplifier contained in the miraDry console. The amplifier is manufactured by a single source manufacturer, Broadband Wireless, LLC, in Reno, Nevada (a subsidiary of United States Technologies, Inc.), or Broadband. We fully own the design and manufacturing process for this amplifier.
 Manufacturing facilities that produce finished medical devices intended for distribution in the United States and internationally are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our products. The FDA inspected our facility in August 2016 and at the conclusion of such routine audit, a Form 483 was issued with two observations. The FDA acknowledged receipt of periodic status reports documenting the completion of corrections and corrective actions taken by us to address each of the two observations. No further actions are required at this time. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality management system certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications for the miraDry System: ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Regulatory Purposes, in support of our CE marking and other international markets. Our notified body, NSAI, most recently audited our facility in a two-part audit due to COVID-19 control measures that occurred in December 2020 and January 2021. This audit resulted in renewal of our ISO 13485-2016 and Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certifications.
 HTI, our disposables manufacturer, complies with the FDA’s QSR and is registered in good standing with the FDA. Additionally, we have procedures in place designed to ensure that all other purchased products and materials conform to specified requirements, including evaluation of suppliers, and where required, qualification of the components supplied.
 Competition 
 Breast Products
 The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We primarily compete with two companies that manufacture and sell breast implants in the United States: Johnson & Johnson through its wholly owned subsidiary, Mentor Worldwide, LLC, or Mentor, and Allergan plc, or Allergan.
 20


Both of our U.S. competitors are either publicly‑traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly‑traded companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. These companies have greater financial resources for sales, marketing and product development, broader established relationships with healthcare providers and third‑party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For example, Allergan sells temporary gel sizers for silicone gel implants and we sell only temporary saline filled sizers. In addition, our competitors may offer pricing programs with discounts across their non‑breast aesthetic product portfolios.
 We also face potential future competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing medical device companies that may be pursuing new implant technologies, new material technologies and new methods of enhancing and reconstructing the breast.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include:
  
• | breadth of portfolio;
--+----------------------


• | technological characteristics of products;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | clinical evidence;
--+-------------------


• | product price;
--+---------------


• | customer service; and
--+----------------------


• | support by key opinion leaders.
--+--------------------------------

 miraDry
 The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic, and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for the miraDry treatment could be limited by the products and technologies offered now or in the future by our competitors as well as the limited capital expenditure budgets of our physician customers. We designed the miraDry treatment to address the concerns of individuals who seek a durable solution to their axillary sweat. Therefore, we compete both directly and indirectly with those companies marketing botulinum toxin and other medical device companies. To a lesser extent, we indirectly compete with antiperspirants. We expect aesthetic medical device companies to pursue technological advances in the treatment of sweat, hair and odor removal that will continue to alter the competitive environment.
 
In the United States, our major competitor in the treatment of sweat is Allergan, which manufactures Botox; Botox is approved for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Cynosure, a division of Hologic, also has received FDA clearance to market PrecisionTX for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Dermira, Inc. received FDA approval for Qbrexza, a topical prescription treatment indicated for primary axillary hyperhidrosis. These competitors may have more resources than us and may prevent our miraDry System from gaining widespread market acceptance.

Due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are approved or cleared for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we face more competition in these markets than in the United States.
 Government Regulation
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, and other regulatory bodies in other countries. 
 21


Regulation by the FDA.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern, among other things:
  
• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | pre‑clinical and clinical testing;
--+-----------------------------------


• | establishment registration and product listing;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | product labeling and storage;
--+------------------------------


• | pre‑market clearance or approval;
--+----------------------------------


• | post‑market studies;
--+---------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | product sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------


• | record-keeping and device tracking;
--+------------------------------------


• | complaint handling;
--+--------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | post‑market surveillance and adverse event reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require a pre‑market notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, a de novo application seeking authorization to market the device, or approval from the FDA of an original or supplemental PMA application. These processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Unless specifically exempted from certain requirements, all three classes of devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre‑market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR, which cover manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Devices deemed to pose low to moderate risk are placed in Class I or II, which, absent an exemption, requires the applicant to obtain a 510(k) clearance. Some Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, specific FDA guidance documents for the device, or particularized labeling requirements, in addition to the general controls and postmarketing requirements that would otherwise apply. Some low risk devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. A PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life‑sustaining, life‑supporting or certain implantable devices, including all breast implants, or devices that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution in the United States before May 28, 1976 for which a regulation requiring a PMA application has not been issued by the FDA. In addition there are some “unclassified” devices in FDA’s regulatory framework, which are  preamendment devices for which a classification regulation has not been promulgated by the agency. Until the unclassified device type has been formally classified and a regulation established, marketing of new devices within this type requires submission of a 510(k) premarket notification. If a 
 22


device of a type that FDA has not previously classified does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no legally marketed predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III.  Under the de novo  process an applicant may seek “down-classification” to Class I or II for a new product type that would otherwise automatically be placed into Class III, but is lower risk. If the FDA agrees with the down-classification, the de novo applicant will then receive authorization to market the device, and a classification regulation will be established for the device type. The device can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions by the manufacturer or a competitor.
 Our tissue expanders and our body contouring, facial and nasal implants received FDA clearance at various dates prior to approval of our breast implants in March 2012. Additionally, the miraDry System is currently regulated as a Class II device that requires 510(k) clearance. Our BIOCORNEUM product contains silicone for scar management, which is a Class I exempt device, and contains sunscreen which FDA regulates as an over-the-counter drug.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a preamendment device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, and provides some guidance on decision making, but the FDA can review any such decision at any time and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, de novo marketing authorization, or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite marketing applications. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 Silicone gel breast implants are treated as Class III devices and a full PMA is required. A PMA for our breast implants was approved by the FDA in March 2012. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive information regarding the product, including pre‑clinical, clinical, and other product data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the intended manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process.
 The FDA may approve a PMA application with post‑approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long‑term follow‑up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device 
 23


covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 Clinical Trials.  A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and may be required for a 510(k) premarket notification. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support product clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non‑significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the Sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects, unless the product is deemed a non‑significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the responsible institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. During a study, we are required to comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them. We are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare information privacy. The investigators must also obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record-keeping requirements. The FDA’s grant of permission to proceed with clinical testing does not constitute a binding commitment that the FDA will consider the study design adequate to support clearance or approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical study will meet chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval.
 Other Regulatory Requirements.  Even though our devices have been approved and commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply after a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre‑market pathway. These include, but are not limited to:

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | various state-level requirements for licensure of medical device manufacturing and/or distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and advertising laws and regulations, and related government guidance and policy as applied by regulators, that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses or in a manner otherwise inconsistent with FDA-required labeling, often referred to as “off‑label,” promotion, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion (in addition, the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of the advertising of medical devices other than “restricted” devices);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24


The FDA may impose additional post-market requirements. For example, the FDA requires us to conduct post‑market surveillance studies and to maintain a system for tracking our breast implants through the chain of distribution to the patient level. 
 The FDA obtains information to inform its oversight of regulatory requirements, and potential regulatory and enforcement action, by a variety of methods including conducting periodic, unannounced inspections, market surveillance, and other inquiries and communications with regulated companies. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
 Failure by us or our manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include, but may not be limited to, any of the following sanctions or consequences:
  
• | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


• | delays in or refusal to grant requests for 510(k) clearance or pre‑market approval of new products or modified products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product recall, detention or seizure;
--+--------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions and consent decrees; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 We and our contract manufacturers and some suppliers of components or device accessories also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with cGMP requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic, unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
 Healthcare Regulation
 As a device manufacturer, even though we do not control referrals or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, as well as other healthcare laws and regulations. Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, marketing, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities may  be subject to regulation under additional healthcare laws by numerous regulatory 
 25


and enforcement authorities in the United States, in addition to the FDA. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, false claims, physician payments sunshine, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
 Additionally, our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Non‑compliance with the laws described below may generally result in the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any actions for non‑compliance of such laws can be costly, time‑consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:
 Federal Anti‑Kickback Statute (“AKS”).  The AKS prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, recommendation, order or furnishing, or the arranging for the purchase, recommendation, order or furnishing, of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as improper payments, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at other than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. The potential safe harbors available for example, relative to the AKS, are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result.
 The penalties for violating the federal AKS include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal AKS is violated.  In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA.
 We have entered into consulting, speaker and other financial arrangements with physicians, including some who prescribe or recommend our products to patients. We engage such physicians as consultants, advisors and to educate other physicians. While we endeavor to ensure that our financial arrangements with actual and potential referral sources comply with applicable federal and state laws, the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws could lead to potential enforcement action. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management's attention from the business. The compliance and enforcement landscape, and related risk, is further informed by government precedent, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts. For example, on November 16, 2020 the OIG published a Special Fraud Alert addressing manufacturer speaker programs signaling that such programs will be subject to an even higher degree of government scrutiny for potential AKS compliance concerns. Our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. Noncompliance with the federal AKS could result in the penalties set forth above.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act (“FCA”).  The FCA prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Manufacturers can be held liable 
 26


under the FCA if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded liability for claims under the Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that Anti-Kickback Statute violations are now “per se” violations under the FCA. Penalties for FCA violations include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal FCA is a civil statute, FCA violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
 In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, known as “qui tam”, or whistleblower, lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. There continue to be hundreds of qui tam actions each year, causing a number of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 Federal Criminal False Claims Laws.  The federal criminal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully making, or causing to be made, a false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining the right to any benefit or payment under a federal health care program. A violation of these laws may constitute a felony or misdemeanor and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law.  The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, augmented two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from governmental programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, mandate, among other things, that certain types of entities and individuals adopt uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA’s standards and requirements directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. We are not a covered entity or a business associate under HIPAA, however, it is possible that in the future, we could, in certain limited circumstances, enter into a business associate relationship with one of our covered entities customers. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, HITECH mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the Department of Health and Human Services, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media.
 27


Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.  
 In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted legislation – the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and enforced. The California Attorney General has issued clarifying regulations and initiated enforcement activity. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Act.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, imposes, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an additional aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures,” for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. We are required to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by March 31 of each calendar year. Beginning January 1, 2021, payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners will also need to be tracked in order to meet reporting requirements going into effect in 2022.
 Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope than federal requirements and guidelines on these topics. The exact applicability and scope of requirements vary from state-to-state and may be subject to regulators’ interpretation, and the landscape may continue to evolve. Certain states, such as California, Nevada, and Connecticut, also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs consistent with industry codes (e.g., for device companies, the AdvaMed Code), among their other requirements. Other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose compliance program-related requirements and restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of certain gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities, and in the case of Connecticut transparency requirements apply to nurse practitioners and other advanced practiced registered nurses. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.
 Additional State Healthcare Laws.  Many states have also adopted some form of each of the aforementioned laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 28


Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable laws.
 United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits United States corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
 International Regulation. International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. We may evaluate international expansion opportunities in the future for Breast Products. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 The regulatory framework governing medical devices is largely harmonized within the European Union (EU), which includes most of the major countries in Europe.  The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. To be placed on the EU market, devices must undergo a conformity assessment and bear the CE mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable rules. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third party assessment, which may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product, is always required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union, except in case of Class I medical devices (those entailing the lowest level of risk). Additional local requirements may apply on a country by country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country by country basis in order for us to market our Breast Products. Switzerland has adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. The United Kingdom (UK) is effectively no longer part of the European Union as of January 1, 2021 due to “Brexit,” and there have been and will be changes in the applicable regulatory framework for medical devices in this jurisdiction.
 Coverage and Reimbursement.  Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products will be covered by third‑party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Breast augmentation and miraDry procedures are generally performed on a cash‑pay basis and are not covered by third‑party payors. In contrast, breast reconstruction procedures may be covered by third‑party payors provided that certain coverage criteria are satisfied, but such third‑party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical device and drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and results.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product or procedure may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product or procedure. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or procedure. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability.
 29


Health Reform.  The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of medical products, including limiting coverage and reimbursement, increasing government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA.
 On December 15, 2019, a federal district court in Texas struck down the ACA in its entirety, finding that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional. On December 14, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas struck down the ACA, deeming it unconstitutional given that Congress repealed the individual mandate in 2017; on July 9, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard arguments on appeal in this matter (formerly Texas v. Azar, now California v. Texas).  On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional given that the TCJA eliminated the tax penalty associated with the individual mandate. In concluding that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the question remains whether, or how much of, the rest of the ACA is severable from that constitutional defect. The Fifth Circuit further remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to further analyze whether the other provisions of the ACA are severable as they currently exist under the law. It is unclear how the eventual decision from this appeal, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and Following appeal of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in California v. Texas on November 2, 2020. 
 It is unclear how the eventual decisions from the Supreme Court and the various other courts across the country to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. It is also unclear how regulations and sub-regulatory policy, which fluctuate continually, may affect interpretation and implementation of the ACA and its practical effects on our business, particularly entering an election year.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our product lines. We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, confidential information, copyrights, patent rights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property. 
 Our Breast Products trademark portfolio consists of 34 worldwide registered trademarks and 25 pending trademark applications. Our miraDry trademark portfolio consists of 96 worldwide registered trademarks. 
 Our Breast Products patent portfolio consists of 1 granted U.S. Patent and 7 pending U.S. patent applications, as well as several in-licensed patent rights. Our miraDry patent portfolio is comprised of 21 granted or allowed U.S. patents, 101 granted or allowed foreign counterpart patents, 3 pending or published U.S. patent applications, and 11 pending or published foreign counterpart patent applications. 
 In addition, to protect our trade secrets, confidential information and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. 
 There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further details on these risks, see Item 1A — “Risk Factors.” 
 30


Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 255 full‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees. Our success is in large part based on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. The members of our management team and our board of directors come from diverse backgrounds, and we seek to attract and recruit diverse, talented, experienced and motivated employees. We monitor our progress with human capital metrics such as turnover, time to fill open roles and rate of internally developed talent. We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities, and other organizations. Our market position, reputation and culture support our ability to recruit and retain talented employees across our departments.
Seasonality
 We expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures and purchase of miraDry procedures. We believe that aesthetic procedures are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to patients planning their procedures leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season.
