Overview
Quotient Technology Inc. is an industry leading promotions and media technology company that delivers targeted digital promotions and media for advertisers and retailers to reach consumers and drive action. Using our platforms and suite of omnichannel solutions, advertisers can plan, target, deliver and measure performance marketing to impact sales. Our vision is to build the world's leading performance marketing platform that programmatically delivers a variety of targeted digital marketing solutions that advertisers and retailers can purchase to drive measurable improvements in sales and customer loyalty. 
Our customers consist primarily of consumer-packaged goods ("CPG") companies and their brand marketers (together referred to as "advertisers") who want to drive sales and positive brand engagement with shoppers. Our digital marketing platform is designed to produce returns on marketing investment for advertisers by utilizing consumer behavior, intent data and point of sale ("POS") data to deliver the right marketing message and call-to-action to the right consumer at the right time, through multiple touchpoints while consumers are engaged online, out of home and in-store. We partner with retailers, who primarily sell products through physical stores and eCommerce properties, as well as non-retailer publisher websites and other properties. We are primarily focused on the US-based grocery retail market and the advertisers who sell products through that channel, and we are expanding our platform to verticals outside of the grocery retail space.
By partnering with Quotient, retailers can monetize their proprietary sales data and offer effective marketing opportunities for their brand partners to engage consumers across multiple touchpoints, including through their owned and operated properties as well as offsite media ad inventory, with the aim of achieving higher sales through their physical stores and eCommerce sites.
Over the last five years, we have grown our platform capabilities and our network of marketing channels to reach shoppers through a combination of in-house innovation, partnerships, and acquisitions. Our network includes the digital properties of our retail partners, non-retail publisher partners and CPG customers, social media platforms, digital out-of-home ("DOOH") properties, and our consumer brand, Shopmium. This network provides Quotient with proprietary and licensed data, including retailers' POS shopper data, first-party consumer behavior and purchase intent data, and location intelligence. With such data powering our platforms, customers and partners use Quotient to leverage consumer insights, target and engage consumers via digital channels, and integrate marketing and merchandising programs to drive measurable sales results and consumer engagement.
Our network is made up of several different constituencies:
•Our advertiser customers consist of approximately 800 CPGs, representing over 2,100 brands, including some of the leading food, beverage, personal care and household product manufacturers;
•Our retail partners represent multiple classes of trade and verticals such as grocery retailers, drug, automotive, mass merchant, dollar, club, and convenience merchandise channels, where most CPGs' products are sold;
•Our publisher partners who invest in online consumer engagement and who help us to increase our network's reach to more US shoppers; and
•Millions of consumers who visit our owned websites, mobile properties and social channels, as well as those of our CPGs, retailer partners and other network partners.
Through these relationships, we believe we have created a network effect, which engages consumers and provides us a competitive advantage over both offline and online competitors. As our network expands and consumer audience increases, we generate more consumer data and insights, which further improves our ability to deliver targeted and personalized promotions and media, and also strengthens our measurement and data insight solutions. We believe this will make our platforms more valuable to advertisers and retailers for their digital marketing campaigns. We expect that the increasing breadth of promotion and media content delivered through Quotient platforms from leading brands will enable us to attract and retain more retailers and consumers. 
Advertisers and retailers use our technology platforms to help achieve their digital marketing objectives in four distinct ways:
•Plan, buy and execute integrated promotions and media campaigns to reach the right shoppers;
•Target advertising, promotions and messaging to shoppers to maximize impact;
•Sell advertising space and activate the shopper data that retailers collect through loyalty programs and digital transactions; and
•Measure the impact of advertisements, promotions or messages that have been planned, sold or placed with "closed loop" measurement, defined as the use of consumer data to help understand and evaluate how certain digital campaigns impact our advertiser customers' and retailer partners' sales.
We deliver targeted and/or personalized digital promotions and media to shoppers through our network using shopper data from our retail partners as well as proprietary data from our audience segments. Our solutions help our customers and partners optimize the performance of their digital marketing campaigns as they continue to shift more of their marketing spend from traditional to digital channels. Our platforms measure performance by attribution of digital campaigns to retail purchases in near real time, demonstrating return on spend for our customers and partners.
Our promotions products include digital rebates, load-to-card loyalty offers, and digital print and paperless coupons. Our media solutions include display, social, DOOH, Retailer.com display and sponsored search, shoppable event pages, and audience segments. A growing number of campaigns that our customers purchase are integrated campaigns, which combine a mix of digital promotions and/or media solutions within a single campaign. Revenue we earn from these programs is generally determined through a duration-based (also known as time-based) pricing model, or on a cost-per-click, cost-per-impression or cost-per-acquisition basis.
We generally pay a distribution fee, or revenue share, to retailers and publishers for activations or redemptions of a digital promotion, for media campaigns, and for use of data targeting and/or measurement. We also pay a fee to third-party publishers for traffic acquisition, which consists of delivering campaigns on certain networks or properties. In cases where we control the digital promotion and media advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, these distribution, revenue share and third-party service fees are included in our cost of revenues. In cases where we do not control the digital promotion and media advertising inventory, we record revenues on a net basis, and the distribution, revenue-share and third-party service fees are deducted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues. 
During 2022, we generated revenues of $288.8 million, representing 45% decline over 2021, and a net loss of $76.5 million in 2022 as compared to a net loss of $45.6 million in 2021. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues during each respective period. 
Our Industry
In our view, our near-term growth will be driven by how well we take advantage of, or how we are impacted by, several major market trends in our industry:
Growth of Retail Media – Retail media presents an opportunity for retailers to generate high-margin ad revenue and monetize their first-party shopper data. The retail media industry is going through a significant transformation, with the frequent introduction of new ad networks, and with many retailers with established retail media strategies bringing their formerly outsourced businesses in-house. While this trend of in-housing has driven a change in our relationships with several retailer partners, presenting challenges for us in recent quarters, the increasingly fragmented landscape presents an opportunity for us to adapt our strategy and take advantage of what we believe has been a gap in the market for a central, transparent platform that aggregates individual retail media networks and simplifies campaign ad planning, buying, execution and measurement for CPGs across multiple retailers. We believe we are well-positioned to help retailers monetize their properties while reducing complexity for CPGs as we continue to see retail media grow.
While retail media is traditionally considered as advertising through retailer-owned media inventory and other digital media to drive sales, Quotient’s vision is that retail media becomes a more comprehensive performance marketing approach that leverages both media and promotions, with promotions being an effective marketing tool for incentivizing action.
Inflationary Environment and Supply Chain Constraints – We continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and input cost pressures affecting our customers and retailer partners as a result of the macro inflationary environment. As a result, many CPG brands have been cautious with allocating promotions and media budgets to prevent overselling. This uncertainty has adversely affected the volume of offers on our network in recent quarters. However, we believe the inflationary environment may eventually become a favorable tailwind for our promotions business as consumers seek out savings at an increasing level, and as CPGs look to combat threats from challenger and private label brands to acquire market share through offering consumers value through lower price points.
Continuing Migration of Marketing Budgets from Offline to Digital – Marketing methods that traditionally have been executed offline are continuing to move to online digital marketing. Historically, the vast majority of CPG's budgets have been spent in offline channels, such as the Free Standing Insert ("FSI") found in newspapers, direct mail, printed circulars, in-store aisle tags, end caps and television. These traditional offline channels are becoming less effective as consumers spend more time online, particularly through mobile devices, and a feature of this trend is the rising importance of using data to drive personalized and targeted content to consumers. To reach consumers at the right time and place, CPGs are increasingly shifting media and promotion dollars that have been historically spent in offline channels to digital channels. The vast majority of US grocery purchases are still made in-person in physical grocery retail stores. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the shift to eCommerce for grocery and other retail transactions. This has led retailers and brands to adopt an omnichannel approach to consumer engagement and buying behaviors. As a result, advertisers are moving advertising budgets to online channels in order to influence more shoppers throughout their path to purchase.
As the shift to digital promotions and media continues to grow, so does the importance placed on the use of data to target audiences and measure campaign performance. As a greater portion of grocery sales have shifted from offline to online, retailers are focused on implementing omnichannel strategies and technology-related solutions to meet consumer demands, and to compete effectively and to drive sales. This omnichannel approach, which leverages combined data from offline and online sales, is resulting in an increased number of digital touchpoints for retailers and their CPGs to target shoppers with relevant promotions and digital marketing. As retailers add more omnichannel capabilities, brands increasingly are able to shift more marketing dollars to digital. 
Business Model Changes
In response to the market trends discussed above, during 2022 we accelerated the evolution of our business model, begun during 2021, to better align our offerings to the demand in the marketplace. Historically, we have taken a managed service approach to digital marketing by supporting our advertiser clients with services throughout the campaign’s planning, execution and measurement phases. Currently, we see an increasing percentage of CPGs, national advertising agencies and other advertisers looking for transparency in the pricing and execution features of a campaign, and also for more self-service capabilities whereby they have more control over the campaign. Over the past few years, we have developed self-service capabilities for several of our products, through which our customers determine campaign objectives, targeting strategy and ad placements. 
We believe moving more business to self-service and away from managed services will enable us to grow more profitably by utilizing the power of our cloud-based platform technology and reducing the manual effort and overhead expenses associated with managed-service campaign execution. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced our retail business model with respect to non-duration based retailer specific (or shopper) promotion and media campaigns. Instead of being a marketing distribution partner, retailers use our proprietary platforms to set pricing and determine how such non-duration based shopper promotions and media campaigns are executed, and pay us for the use of our technology and services. This business model change was designed to provide several benefits to retailer customers including improved pricing transparency and control over the shopper marketing campaign’s prospects for success. Also, in this model, under generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize revenue net of third-party costs for such non-duration based shopper programs. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information.
Our duration-based promotions solution and pricing model also responds to trends in our industry. This solution provides advertisers access to our proprietary platforms for a specific period of time (the campaign period) in exchange for a fixed fee. The fixed campaign period allows retailers and advertisers to coordinate merchandising calendars with the specific time periods during which the promotion is run. Duration-based pricing also more directly aligns with the traditional way in which promotions have been priced and executed using traditional physical coupons distributed through the FSI historically included in the daily or Sunday newspaper. 
Promotions that are still run under our historical cost-per click or cost-per-acquisition model could result in a digital coupon or rebate that is available online for only the first few days of a campaign, if shopper activations are higher than expected. Under our duration-based pricing model, a promotional offer will be available for use during the entire planned start and end dates, which generally are between seven and twenty-eight days.
We believe this duration-based pricing and delivery model is beneficial to our retailer partners and advertisers as it aligns with their traditional methods of budgeting for marketing spend and executing on merchandising plans. We launched this pricing model in 2021 and continued to migrate advertiser clients to duration-based pricing throughout 2022. 
Our Platforms and Solutions
We offer technology and solutions that power integrated digital promotions and media campaigns for brands and retailers. Our platforms enable our customers to plan, buy and execute measurable campaigns that target key shopper audiences to drive profitable sales, build loyalty and increase brand awareness and affinity. In our view, the scale of our network, our rich first and second party data, and our programmatic technology—which offer omnichannel execution, brand safety, and efficiency and transparency of ad buying—provide competitive differentiators and a strong foundation for driving profitable and sustainable growth.
To fully leverage the power of our network and to drive focused execution, we have aligned our organization around four key product families, each representing a distinct growth opportunity. The four key product areas are promotions, direct-to-consumer ("DTC"), Retail Ad Network, and DOOH.
Promotions
Our promotions business consists of a broad network of consumer touchpoints across our retailer and publisher properties as well as our DTC app through which we deliver savings to consumers. We continue to scale our network through building on existing partnerships, and securing new partnerships, which we believe represents growth potential as we offer consumers convenient ways to find value wherever they spend time and however they wish to save.
Our promotions platform offers consumers the ability to save through cash-back rebates, digital paperless promotions and digital print promotions, available across our distribution network. With digital paperless and rebates, shoppers add promotions directly to retailer loyalty accounts for automatic digital redemption, or use a mobile device to take a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for cash-back redemption. With digital print, shoppers select promotions and print them from their desktop or mobile device to redeem in-store.
Through this platform, brands and retailers can reach shoppers on the web and on mobile devices by offering digital promotions through our extensive network which includes:
•brand and retailer websites and mobile applications;
•thousands of third-party publisher websites and mobile applications; and
•the DTC Shopmium mobile application.
Promotions can be personalized and/or targeted to shoppers through a combination of data points including historical shopper purchase and intent data, promotion activations and redemptions, shopper interests, online click and search behavior, demographics, and location data. These techniques are designed to enable us to optimize the delivery of promotions across the network and drive campaign performance.
Our promotions platform is used by retailers in the grocery, drug, automotive, mass merchant, dollar, club and convenience merchandise channels to integrate into their POS systems or loyalty programs. This solution is 
designed to function as a component of the retailer's digital marketing platform, to create a direct, digital relationship with shoppers, and to engage them through an omnichannel experience. Through our promotions platform, we use consumer data and insights to distribute personalized and targeted promotions and media, primarily funded by our advertiser customers, to help drive consumer loyalty and increase sales. Additional solutions on this platform that aim to increase visibility of promotions include personalized e-mails, digital grocery lists, branded event pages, and digital circulars.
Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)
Our direct-to-consumer properties play an important role in our network as an additional way for us to drive action from consumers. We provide CPGs and other parties access to our properties, namely the Shopmium app, to deliver cash back rebates to consumers and market advertisers' brands media and product placements.
In 2022, we launched Shopmium, our formerly solely EU-focused app, in the U.S. market. Shopmium is our premium DTC brand that provides a rich set of features and capabilities to our partner network and drives consumer engagement and savings. Shopmium is replacing Coupons.com as our DTC product in the U.S.
During 2022, we entered an agreement with CupoNation GmbH to sell the domain Coupons.com. Prior to 2022, Coupons.com was our flagship consumer brand with both mobile app and website properties that delivered savings to consumers. The transfer of the Coupons.com domain to CupoNation GmbH is planned to conclude in 2023.
Retail Ad Network
Our Retail Ad Network aims to address the previously discussed challenges facing brands and retailers due to the increasing fragmentation of the retail media ecosystem. The Retail Ad Network solution is designed to aggregate individual in-housed retail media networks to enable the planning, buying, execution and measurement of scaled yet targeted media campaigns, through one centralized platform. The platform-based solution aims to provide brands with a way to support multiple national and regional retailers with advertising without having to resource and navigate the individual networks of each retailer. 
We believe that as more retailers join the Retail Ad Network, the scale amassed by multiple retailers within the network will attract commensurate ad investment from brands, thus giving retailers of all sizes and classes of trade the opportunity to access a larger share of ad dollars. 
The Retail Ad Network is in its early stages, with several brands and retailers participating in our initial launch in late 2022. In 2023, we plan to continue to develop and scale the Retail Ad Network through adding new retailers and new channels.
Digital-out-of-Home (DOOH)
Our digital-out-of-home (DOOH) offering features proprietary location-based technology that allows marketing agencies and advertisers to target specific consumer segments, reach shoppers in and out of stores through digital screens located outside of the home—in places such as retail establishments and transportation hubs—and measure the direct impact on sales. Quotient's self-service platform is designed to address the unique challenges of the DOOH market. 
We provide proprietary data and analytics capabilities as part of our offerings across all product families through our measurement platform, Quotient Analytics. This provides campaign analytics and measured sales results to brands and retailers, attributing digital promotions and/or media campaigns to in-store and online purchases. Through Quotient Analytics, we combine purchase data from select retailers across our network with online engagement and purchase-intent data from Quotient’s consumer properties and its publishing partners. Our campaign measurement tools are also designed to provide brands and retailers with flexibility to optimize their campaigns to drive greater efficiency with marketing dollars. This capability and analysis is provided to customers who utilize our promotions and/or media platforms. Our campaign measurement tools provide the basis for our calculations to CPGs regarding their Return-on-Ad-Spend and Return-on-Promotion-Spend. As our platforms, network impact and audience numbers expand, we believe that the value of our data and analytics increases. 
Growth Strategy
    We believe that we have made substantial progress in shifting our business model from a managed services company and outsourced agency for retailers to a higher-margin, platform-based solution for our network partners, which in our view sets us up for growth in the rapidly evolving programmatic marketplace. Broadly speaking, there are two thematic pillars of our growth strategy: (i) expanding our promotions network, and (ii) investing in strategic growth initiatives built around key areas of our existing platform. 
Expanding our Promotions Network.    The first part of our strategy is to expand our promotions business, which we believe will drive organic growth. We intend to do this through driving net new category expansion and new content, through further penetration within our existing CPG customer accounts, which represent some of the largest CPG manufacturers in the U.S., and through working with more small and mid-tier sized brands. We also plan to continue to grow the reach and engagement of our network through securing new and growing existing network partners, which includes both retailer partners and publisher partners.
Additionally, we plan to continue to invest in product innovation designed to increase engagement from consumers, simplify promotions planning and execution for brands, and provide better alignment of brand campaigns with retailer merchant strategies and calendars. This, we believe, will evolve the role of promotions in the marketing strategies of brands and retailers.
Investing in strategic growth initiatives.    The second part of our growth strategy is to invest in strategic growth initiatives built around a number of assets within our existing platform, where we believe we have differentiators and see the potential for future market growth. These assets include the Shopmium app, our DOOH platform, and our Retail Ad Network solution.
Starting with Shopmium, we believe that this DTC product is an important extension of our promotions business as it provides incremental reach for our network and allows Quotient to establish a direct relationship with shoppers and their first-party shopper data. 
Our next strategic growth initiative is DOOH where, according the 2022 "US Digital Out-of-Home Ad Spending" report by eMarketer, the market is expected to grow at 12% through 2026. We see an opportunity to scale our DOOH business through the continued penetration of brands and marketing agencies. In addition, we believe there exists an opportunity to work with retailers as a DOOH technology partner, enabling the retailer to "white label" and offer our platform as part of their retail media businesses. We believe this is an interesting proposition to retailers, as our DOOH location-based demand side platform enables access to DOOH ad inventory at a point of high intent nearby the store for both retailers and their brand partners looking to expand their consumer reach.
We believe our Retail Ad Network, another of our strategic growth initiatives, presents a unique solution to combine media campaigns with promotions and deliver a call-to-action to drive sales, while centralizing and simplifying campaign ad planning and execution across multiple retailers. We have seen positive reception both from brands facing challenges presented by the fragmented landscape of ad networks, and from retailers looking to compete with the scale of the largest networks. In 2023 we plan to scale the network further through adding further retailer partners and channels to the network. 
We believe that through executing on one or more of these strategic growth strategies, we will be able to grow content, consumer engagement and, ultimately, revenue in 2023. 
Fraud Prevention and Distribution Controls
Our platforms include a proprietary digital distribution management system designed to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for linking coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique identifier (ID) that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique identifier ("ID") also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platforms allow us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons. We also have a proprietary rebate distribution solution with built-in authentication capabilities through phone and payment verification. Additionally, we have transactional level controls for rebates to enforce stacking rules and prevent receipt alteration and/or manipulation. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. We believe that our sales, integration, digital promotions and media campaign management and measurement capabilities, as well as our customer success and support capabilities, are difficult to replicate and are a key reason for the growth of our business. Our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands and marketing agencies we work with within existing and new CPG customers, including a focus on smaller CPGs and new categories. The team is also focused on expanding relationships within CPGs to new buyers such as shopper marketing and digital media teams, where we believe there is a large opportunity for growth. Additionally, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our partner networks through growing existing partnerships and adding new partnerships with retailers and publishers.
In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers with the aim of ensuring that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified time frames. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.
We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new revenue pipelines from both CPGs and retailers. We often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team runs targeted digital marketing programs, develops data-led collateral and customer case studies, sponsors and conducts research, and delivers engaging content through social media channels. 
Technology and Infrastructure
Since inception and primarily during 2022, we have made significant investments and have been focused on the development of new features and functionality of our technology. We plan to continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary platforms aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on solutions that provide measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and data scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include:
•Scalable infrastructure.    We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software in seeking to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platforms. We use a combination of public and private cloud computing platforms. Our private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across data centers in co-location facilities situated in California and Virginia.
•Redundancy.    Our critical production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to another data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site are designed to provide fast recovery whenever recovery is requested. Each single data center has been designed to handle an activity level in excess of our entire system needs, the goal of which is to enable us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact.
•Reporting.    Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide campaign insights.
•AdTech.    Our media delivery is largely powered by proprietary ad servers, creative and social platforms, workflow automation tools, and data management tools. We develop and use these platforms with a range of differentiated features that are specialized for the CPG and retail industries.
•Security.    Our security policy adheres to established policies that are designed to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it.
Competition
We compete against a variety of companies with respect to different aspects of our business.
Promotions:
•Direct-to-Consumer apps such as iBotta, Inc. and Fetch Rewards, which offer cash back rebate and rewards solutions;
•Other providers of digital promotions such as Valassis Communications, Inc., Catalina Marketing Corporation’s Cellfire; Inmar/You Technology; and Neptune Retail Solutions; 
•Offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in FSIs or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., Neptune Retail Solutions and Catalina Marketing Corporation;
Media:
•Retailers who develop and manage, with or without a third-party vendor, retail media or data products in-house, such as the Albertsons Media Collective, or The Kroger Company ("Kroger") with its wholly owned subsidiary of 84.51°; and
•Companies offering digital advertising technology, inventory, data, and services solutions and channels for advertisers and retailers including: Meta Platforms, Inc. (doing business as Facebook), Alphabet, Inc. ("Alphabet"), Pinterest, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), Adobe Inc., The Trade Desk, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Criteo S.A., Microsoft Corporation, Publicis Groupe's CitrusAd and others.
In certain instances, we have entered into, and in the future we may enter into, strategic alliances or partnerships with companies that are competitors in other areas of our business. We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following:
•scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting advertisers and retailers to consumers in a digital manner;
•scale and reach of a company's retailer and publisher network; 
•scale and reach of a company's targetable audience data;
•ability to attract consumers, retailers and CPGs to a company's platform and solutions;
•breadth, quality and relevance of a company's solutions and ability to innovate;
•platform security, usability, scalability, reliability and availability;
•integration with retailer applications, POS systems, and consumer channels;
•access to and quality of consumer data, including transaction data;
•ability to measure, and measurement that demonstrates the effectiveness of campaigns; 
•quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of digital marketing campaigns;
•integration of products and solutions;
•ability to rapidly deploy products and services for customers;
•ability to deliver high quality and increasing numbers of digital promotions that are widely available and easy to use in consumers’ preferred form;
•brand recognition and reputation; and 
•ability to recruit, retain, and train employees.
While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger, more-established and greater-resourced companies that seek to enter our market, or from smaller companies that launch new products, solutions and services that could gain market acceptance.
Human Capital Resources
Our plan for long-term business success is driven by technological innovation, superior customer service, and operational excellence. We operate under a single purpose: transforming shopping to make life better for consumers, brands, retailers and our employees. Attracting, developing and retaining top talent are critical to our long-term business goals and to fulfilling our Company purpose. We know that investing in our people is just as important as investing in our products.
After nearly two years of working remotely, we reopened our offices in early 2022 and began operating in a hybrid environment. To enhance employee productivity and drive collaboration, we encouraged employees back to the office and recommenced company travel for in-person interaction. In the U.S., a vaccination policy was in effect for most of the year as an added precaution for employee health and safety as concerns about COVID-19 persisted.
As office utilization changed in a post-COVID environment, the Company re-evaluated its real estate footprint, opting to exit offices in San Francisco and Nashville, and deciding not to proceed with a new office in Santa Clara. Flexible alternatives to traditional (leased) office space are being considered as part of our ongoing real estate strategy.
As our business model continued to evolve, it was necessary to take actions to right size the Company to be more in line with a leading promotions and media technology company. In the second half of 2022, we took actions to reduce our workforce. Employees impacted were provided a transition period and a comprehensive severance package. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 880 full-time employees, consisting of 466 employees in the United States and 414 employees internationally. Voluntary workforce turnover was 32% in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our global workforce was 48% female, and nearly 41% of our employees holding a "manager or above" title were women. As of such date, women represented 40% of our senior leadership team. 
We strive to create an environment that welcomes and supports diversity and promotes equity and inclusion across all levels of the Company. In 2022, we continued our ongoing partnership with an external learning platform focused on diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI awareness) and education, reaching nearly 900 employees globally. We believe that this platform has built greater awareness, maximized employee connections, and elevated decision-making in the workplace.
We believe that investing in our employees' development is pivotal to ensuring sustainable performance success as a high-growth global technology company. We are committed to providing training and development that supports employees in their current roles and beyond. Through our current Learning Management System, employees can choose learning that appeals to them with over 16,000 content and expert-led courses. In addition, we created content and required compliance training, all of which can be easily accessed on the platform. Employees completed over 2,000 hours of learning in 2022.
Our talent and performance process aligns performance to reward and provides actionable feedback to employees. Twice a year, leaders commit to a comprehensive organization and talent review, covering key elements such as organization structure, employee performance and potential, succession planning and employee development. 
We have a long-standing culture of helping local communities and neighbors through our philanthropic program. "Quotient for Change" is committed to providing communities with tangible outcomes through our three key pillars: Economic Stability, Technological Equity and Environmental Sustainability. We also maintain our matching gift program, which offers full-time employees a monetary match on their charitable donations. We donated over $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, supporting nearly 400 charities globally, and logged over 1,500 volunteer hours.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and equivalent rights in other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we hold or have exclusive rights to 52 active issued patents in the United States and 36 active patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2024 and 2040.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or in other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective, or may require significant expenditures and other resources to enforce. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could harm our business and our operating results, or our ability to compete.
Companies in Internet-related and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to in the past, and we expect that we may face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
