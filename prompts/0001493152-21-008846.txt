Quanta Basics
 
Quanta is a cutting-edge technology platform whose patented, proprietary technology harnesses advances in quantum biology to increase the potency of active ingredients. Currently, Quanta supports product formulations in pain management, anti-inflammation, skincare, agriculture, nutritional supplements, and plant-based consumables. Ultimately, Quanta’s mission is to deliver better, more effective ingredients to elevate product efficacy, reduce waste and facilitate healthier, more sustainable consumption.
 
The established resonance theory behind Quanta’s polarization process has many potential applications. From potentiating bio-ingredients to produce more-effective carbon-trapping plants to transformative anti-aging solutions Quanta’s technology has the opportunity to upend how commercial products are made and the benefits from them. Already we see multi-trillion-dollar global industries benefiting from Quanta’s technology.
 
Our proof of concept, Quanta’s market-leading CBD pain-relief rub (“Muscle Rub”), is only the first in a series of paradigm shift products to emerge from our labs. At the heart of its well-documented effectiveness is our proprietary “polarization” process, which uses electromagnetic force to markedly enhance bioactivity at the molecular level—a polarized active ingredient is more soluble and creates stronger bonds with the body’s receptors. This allows us to enhance ingredients so they work faster and more powerfully without the use of chemical by-products or cellular penetration. Quanta believes this natural solution has nearly limitless applications in the world of plant-based consumer products.
 
Quanta is involved in ambitious projects that we believe will reshape the next wave of climate science, sustainability, nutrition, and more. Having harnessed the technology of the future, Quanta is dedicated to bringing tomorrow’s health and wellness solutions to the billions in need today.
