ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

GENERAL
Terex is a global manufacturer of lifting and material processing products and services that deliver lifecycle solutions to maximize customer return on investment. The Company delivers lifecycle solutions to a broad range of industries, including the construction, infrastructure, manufacturing, shipping, transportation, refining, energy, utility, quarrying and mining industries. We report in three business segments: (i) Aerial Work Platforms (“AWP”); (ii) Cranes; and (iii) Materials Processing (“MP”).
Our Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986 as Terex U.S.A., Inc. We have changed significantly since that time, and much of this change has been historically accomplished through acquisitions and managing our portfolio of companies by divestiture of non-core businesses and products. We also continue to focus on becoming an industry leading operating company.
Our business is international in scope, with our products manufactured in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and sold worldwide.

OTHER
We may assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through Terex Financial Services (“TFS”). TFS uses its equipment financing experience to provide financing solutions to our customers who purchase our equipment. TFS provides financing support primarily: (i) in the United States and on a limited basis in China, originating, underwriting, documenting, funding and servicing financing transactions directly with end-user customers, distributors and rental companies; and (ii) by facilitating loans and leases between our customers and third party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are fixed and floating rate loans. However, TFS also provides sales-type leases, operating leases and rentals. TFS, in the normal course of business, also sells loans and leases to financial institutions with which it has established relationships.
The on-book financing activities of TFS have primarily been limited to the United States and China. Additionally, in those countries in which TFS engages in on-book financing, TFS continually evaluates the level to which it utilizes third party funding versus direct customer financing to meet its business objectives.
5

TFS continually monitors used equipment values of Terex equipment in the secondary market sales channels for all of our equipment categories. This provides a basis for TFS to project future values of equipment for the underwriting of leases or loans. These re-marketing channels are also used if equipment is returned at end of lease, or is repossessed in case of a customer default. TFS uses the resale channel which maximizes proceeds and/or mitigates risk for Terex and our funding partners.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Material Handling and Port Solutions (“MHPS”)
On January 4, 2017, the Company completed the disposition of its MHPS business (the “Disposition”) to Konecranes Plc, a Finnish public company limited by shares (“Konecranes”) pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the “SAPA”). In connection with the Disposition, we received 19.6 million newly issued Class B shares of Konecranes and approximately $832 million in cash after adjustments for estimated cash, debt and net working capital at closing and the divestiture of Konecranes’ Stahl Crane Systems business (“Stahl”), which was undertaken by Konecranes in connection with the Disposition. The final transaction consideration is subject to post-closing adjustments for the actual cash, debt and net working capital at closing, the 2016 performance of the MHPS business and Konecranes business, and the closing of the sale of Stahl. The sale of the Company’s MHPS business to Konecranes represents a significant strategic shift in the Company’s business away from universal, process, mobile harbor and ship-to-shore cranes that will have a major effect on the Company’s future operating results, primarily because the MHPS business represented the entirety of one of the Company’s five previous reportable operating segments and comprised two of the Company’s six previous reporting units, representing a significant portion of the Company’s revenues and assets, and is therefore accounted for as a discontinued operation. MHPS products include universal cranes, process cranes and components, such as rope hoists, chain hoists, light crane systems, travel units and electric motors, primarily for industrial applications, and mobile harbor cranes, ship-to-shore gantry cranes, rubber tired and rail mounted gantry cranes, straddle carriers, sprinter carriers, reach stackers, container handlers, general cargo lift trucks, automated stacking cranes, automated guided vehicles and software solutions for logistics terminals. On February 15, 2017, Terex sold approximately 7.5 million Konecranes shares for net proceeds of approximately $268 million. Following the sale of shares, Terex owns approximately 15.5% of the outstanding shares of Konecranes and has two director representatives on the Konecranes Board.
See Note A – “Sale of MHPS Business” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the sale of the MHPS business.
Truck Business
On May 30, 2014, the Company sold its truck business, which was consolidated in its former Construction segment, to Volvo Construction Equipment for approximately $160 million. The truck business manufactured and sold off-highway rigid and articulated haul trucks. Included in the transaction was the manufacturing facility in Motherwell, Scotland. As a result, the reporting of the truck business has been included in discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented.
See Note E – “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our discontinued operations.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Terex is a specialized manufacturer of capital equipment and related services. Our goal is to design, manufacture and market equipment and services that provide superior life-cycle return on invested capital to our customers (“Customer ROIC”). Customer ROIC is a primary focus of our organization and is central to our ability to generate returns for investors. 
6

We operate our business based on our value system, “The Terex Way.” The Terex Way values shape the culture of our Company and reflect our collective commitment to what it means to be a part of Terex. The Terex Way is based on six key values:

• | Integrity: Integrity reflects honesty, ethics, transparency and accountability. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our business dealings and we never sacrifice our integrity for profit.


• | Respect: Respect incorporates concern for safety, health, teamwork, diversity, inclusion and performance. We treat all our team members, customers and suppliers with respect and dignity.


• | Improvement: Improvement encompasses quality, problem-solving systems, a continuous improvement culture and collaboration. We continuously search for new and better ways of doing things, focusing on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste.


• | Servant Leadership: Servant leadership requires service to others, humility, authenticity and leading by example. We work to serve the needs of our customers, investors and team members.


• | Courage: Courage entails willingness to take risks, responsibility, action and empowerment. We have the courage to make a difference even when it is difficult.


• | Citizenship: Citizenship means social responsibility and environmental stewardship. We comply with all laws, respect all people’s values and cultures, and are good global, national and local citizens.

During 2016, Terex began implementing a strategic transformation strategy that has three principal elements:

1. | Focus the portfolio on businesses best positioned to generate returns above the cost of capital through the cycle.


2. | Simplify company structure, systems and footprint to improve efficiency and enhance global competitiveness.


3. | Execute to Win, driving process discipline, execution rigor, and accountability in core processes.

The “Focus” element of this strategy is to concentrate our business portfolio in product categories where we are among the top three competitors and a market leader. Where we are not among the market leaders our strategy has been to either divest those product lines or pursue a business strategy which we believe will enable us to become a market leader. Being among the leaders in a category is important as it implies a product offering that customers respect and an ability to generate returns that exceed our cost of capital. Work related to this strategic theme involves ongoing review of all businesses in the portfolio from the perspectives of market attractiveness and competitive position.
In pursuit of the focus element of our business strategy, our product portfolio has undergone significant change in recent years. We took several actions to focus the business portfolio. In particular, we strategically divested our former MHPS segment and we have also divested many of the businesses that comprised our former Construction segment.
Following the Disposition and sales of our former Construction segment product lines, Terex is a smaller company whose revenue is more concentrated in terms of both geographic and end market exposures. Our 2016 revenues, excluding divested businesses, were 51% North America, 27% Western Europe, and 22% other geographies. End-use mix is weighted towards construction and maintenance end-uses which represented more than 80% of 2016 revenue. Given anticipated economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe over the next several years, we believe that this mix of products offers meaningful near term opportunity for our Company. We do not currently anticipate major portfolio actions over the near term that would significantly alter our current business mix.
The “Simplify” element of the Terex strategy is centered on complexity reduction and cost management. Historically, Terex has grown through acquisitions and our businesses were generally operated autonomously. This resulted in a complex legal entity structure, multiple financial systems, and high organizational complexity. As part of our transformational strategy, we are addressing these issues and are implementing strategic initiatives to simplify our structure, footprint and processes. We are working to flatten and streamline the organization. We have undertaken a financial transformation that will simplify the way that we measure and manage the Company day-to-day. We are also simplifying the Company’s manufacturing footprint by reducing the number of production facilities, sharing facilities across businesses, and driving aggressive productivity improvement within the facilities that we operate. While the actions required to achieve these improvements are difficult, the benefits to both customers and shareholders are significant. 
7

The third major theme of the Terex strategy is “Execute to Win” (“ETW”), which is a focus on three key management processes: Talent development, strategy development and deployment, and operational excellence. ETW represents a major change in the philosophy of our Company in terms of where and how work is done. Our goal is to become operationally excellent, balancing desire for business autonomy with the need for overall efficiency and relying on process excellence as a critical enabler of both business and company performance. We have identified three specific near-term transformational priorities in our implementation of Execute to Win. 

1. | Lifecycle Solutions are comprehensive solutions that include our equipment and other offerings such as financing, spare parts, technical and repair services, operator training, and technology solutions that drive Customer ROIC.


2. | Commercial Excellence is about driving process discipline and execution in our commercial operations, such as sales, pricing, marketing, and sales support.


3. | Strategic Sourcing will involve implementing a standard, Terex-wide strategic sourcing process that will help us leverage our spending, thereby achieving lower costs from suppliers.

Each of these activities is being managed as a company-wide priority, with leadership from the center and support from within Terex businesses. Implementation involves a wide-ranging set of actions that are intended to deliver step-change performance improvement. These actions appropriately balance the unique needs of specific businesses with overall potential for efficiency and for leverage on investments. We are expecting major contributions in these three areas over the next one to three years as well as improved processes that will become foundational drivers for differentiating Terex in the years ahead. 
Capital allocation is the final element of our overall strategy. We view capital allocation priorities (in order) as follows:

1. | Maintain an optimal capital structure (~2.5 x average net debt to EBITDA over the cycle)


2. | Organic growth investments (product & service development, maintenance capex, geographic expansion)


3. | Restructuring investments (general & administrative cost reduction, footprint rationalization)


4. | Efficient return of capital to shareholders (dividends and share repurchases)

PRODUCTS
AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS
AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS. Aerial work platform equipment safely positions workers and materials easily and quickly to elevated work areas to enhance productivity. These products have developed as alternatives to scaffolding and ladders. We offer a variety of aerial lifts that are categorized into six product families: portable material lifts; portable aerial work platforms; trailer-mounted articulating booms; self-propelled articulating and self-propelled telescopic booms; and scissor lifts.

• | Portable material lifts are used primarily indoors in the construction, industrial and theatrical markets.


• | Portable aerial work platforms are used primarily indoors in a variety of markets to perform overhead maintenance.


• | Trailer-mounted articulating booms are used both indoors and outdoors. They provide versatile reach, and have the ability to be towed between job sites.


• | Self-propelled articulating booms are primarily used in construction and industrial applications, both indoors and outdoors. They feature lifting versatility with up, out and over position capabilities to access difficult to reach overhead areas.


• | Self-propelled telescopic booms are used outdoors in commercial and industrial construction, as well as highway and bridge maintenance projects.


• | Scissor lifts are used in indoor and outdoor applications in a variety of construction, industrial and commercial settings.

TELEHANDLERS. Telehandlers move and place materials on residential and commercial construction sites and are used in the energy and infrastructure industries.
LIGHT TOWERS. Trailer-mounted light towers are used primarily to light work areas for construction, entertainment, emergency assistance and security during nighttime or low light applications.
8

CRANES
We offer a wide variety of cranes, including mobile telescopic cranes, lattice boom crawler cranes, tower cranes, and utility equipment.
MOBILE TELESCOPIC CRANES. Mobile telescopic cranes are used primarily for industrial applications, in commercial and public works construction, and in maintenance applications to lift equipment or material. We offer a complete line of mobile telescopic cranes, including rough terrain cranes, truck cranes, truck-mounted cranes (boom trucks), all terrain cranes and pick and carry cranes.

• | Rough terrain cranes move materials and equipment on rugged or uneven terrain and are often located on a single construction or work site for long periods. Rough terrain cranes cannot be driven on highways (other than in Italy) and accordingly must be transported by truck to the work site.


• | Truck cranes have two cabs and can travel rapidly from job site to job site at highway speeds. Truck cranes are often used for multiple local jobs, primarily in urban or suburban areas.


• | Truck-mounted cranes (boom trucks). We manufacture telescopic boom cranes and articulated hydraulic cranes for mounting on a commercial truck chassis. Truck-mounted cranes are used primarily in the construction and maintenance industries to lift equipment or materials to various heights. Boom trucks are generally lighter and have less lifting capacity than truck cranes, and are used for many of the same applications when lower lifting capacities are sufficient. An advantage of a boom truck is that the equipment or material to be lifted by the crane can be transported by the truck, which can travel at highway speeds. Applications include delivery of building materials and the installation of commercial air conditioners and other roof-mounted equipment, and the erection of transmission towers and substation equipment in the electrical grids. 


• | All-terrain cranes are a cross between rough terrain and truck cranes, and are designed to travel across both rough terrain and highways.


• | Pick and carry cranes are designed for a wide variety of applications, including use at mine sites, large fabrication yards, building and construction sites and in machinery maintenance and installation. They combine high road speed with all-terrain capability.

LATTICE BOOM CRAWLER CRANES. Lattice boom crawler and lattice boom pedestal cranes are designed to lift material on rough terrain. The boom is made of tubular steel sections, which, together with the base unit, are transported to and erected at a construction site. Applications include infrastructure building, wind turbine erection, construction of nuclear power and petrochemical plants and heavy lifting within oil refineries and the construction industry.
TOWER CRANES. Tower cranes are often used in urban areas where space is constrained and in long-term or very high building sites. Tower cranes lift construction material and place the material at the point of use. We produce the following types of tower cranes:

• | Self-erecting tower cranes unfold from sections and can be trailer mounted; certain larger models have a telescopic tower and folding jib. These cranes can be assembled on site in a few hours. Applications include residential and small commercial construction.


• | Hammerhead tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. The tower extends above the jib to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to three days depending on height, and can increase in height with the project.


• | Flat top tower cranes have a tower and a horizontal jib assembled from sections. There is no A-frame above the jib, which is self-supporting and consists of reinforced jib sections. These cranes are assembled on-site in one to two days, and can increase in height with the project.


• | Luffing jib tower cranes have a tower and an angled jib assembled from sections. There is one A-frame above the jib to which suspension cables supporting the jib are attached. Unlike other tower cranes, there is no trolley to control linear movement of the load, which is accomplished by changing the jib angle. These cranes are assembled on-site in two to three days, and can increase in height with the project.

UTILITY EQUIPMENT. Our utility products include digger derricks, auger drills, insulated and non-insulated aerial devices and cable placers. These products are used by electric utilities, tree care companies, telecommunications and cable companies, and the related construction industries, as well as by government organizations.

• | Digger derricks are insulated products used to dig holes, hoist and set utility poles, as well as lift transformers and other materials at job sites near energized power lines. Auger drills are used to dig holes for utility poles or construction foundations requiring larger diameter holes in difficult soil conditions.


• | Insulated aerial devices are used to elevate workers and material to work areas at the top of utility poles near energized transmission and distribution lines and for trimming trees near energized electrical lines, as well as for miscellaneous purposes such as sign maintenance. Non-insulated aerials are used in applications where energized electrical lines are not a hazard.


• | Cable placers are used to install fiber optic, copper and strand telephone and cable lines.

SERVICES. We offer a range of services for aerial work platform and utility equipment consisting of inspections, preventative maintenance, general repairs, reconditioning, refurbishment, modernization and spare parts, as well as consultancy and training services. Our services are provided on our own products and on third-party products and related equipment.
MATERIALS PROCESSING
Materials processing equipment is used in processing aggregate materials for building applications and is also used in the quarrying, mining, demolition, recycling, landscaping and biomass production industries. Our materials processing equipment includes crushers, screens and feeders, washing systems as well as wood and biomass chippers.
We manufacture a range of jaw, impactor (both horizontal and vertical shaft) and cone crushers, as well as base crushers for integration within mobile, modular and static plants.

• | Jaw crushers are used for crushing larger rock, primarily at the quarry face or on recycling duties. Applications include hard rock, sand and gravel and recycled materials. Cone crushers are used in secondary and tertiary applications to reduce a number of materials, including quarry rock and riverbed gravel.


• | Horizontal shaft impactors are primary and secondary crushers. They are typically applied to reduce soft to medium hard materials, as well as recycled materials. Vertical shaft impactors are secondary and tertiary crushers that reduce material utilizing various rotor configurations and are highly adaptable to any application.

Our screening and feeder equipment includes:

• | Heavy duty inclined and horizontal screens and feeders, which are used in low to high tonnage applications and are available as either stationary or heavy-duty mobile equipment. Screens are used in all phases of plant design from handling quarried material to fine screening. Dry screening is used to process materials such as sand, gravel, quarry rock, coal, ore, construction and demolition waste, soil, compost and wood chips.


• | Feeders are used to unload materials from hoppers and bulk material storage at controlled rates. They are available for applications ranging from primary feed hoppers to fine material bin unloading. Our range includes apron feeders, grizzly feeders and pan feeders.

Washing system products include mobile and static wash plants incorporating separation, washing, scrubbing, dewatering and stockpiling. We manufacture mobile and stationary rinsing screens, scrubbing systems, sand screw dewaterers, bucket-wheel dewaterers, hydrocyclone plants for efficient silt extraction and a range of stockpiling conveyors. Washing systems operate in the aggregates, recycling, mining and industrial sands segments.
Wood processing biomass and recycling equipment includes grinders, chippers, compost turners, shredders, and de-barker systems. This equipment is used in, among other things, the pulp and paper, wood energy, green waste/construction and demolition recycling industries.

BACKLOG
Our backlog for continuing operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

 | December 31, 
 | 2016 | | 2015
 | (in millions)
AWP | $ | 506.1 | | | $ | 569.7 
Cranes | 323.4 | | | 407.4 | 
MP | 215.6 | | | 148.5 | 
Corporate and other | 27.4 | | | 51.6 | 
Total | $ | 1,072.5 | | | $ | 1,177.2

We define backlog as firm orders that are expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts orders are generally filled on an as-ordered basis.
Our management views backlog as one of many indicators of the performance of our business. Because many variables can cause changes in backlog, and these changes may or may not be of any significance, we consequently view backlog as an important, but not necessarily determinative, indicator of future results. High backlog can indicate a high level of future sales; however, when backlogs are high, this may also reflect a high level of production delays, which may result in future order cancellations from disappointed customers. Low backlog may indicate less future sales; however, they may also reflect a rapid ability to fill orders that is appreciated by our customers.
11

Our overall backlog amounts at December 31, 2016 decreased $104.7 million from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower orders in AWP and Cranes and disposition of certain construction equipment product lines. The translation effect of foreign exchange rates negatively impacted backlog year-over-year by approximately 2%.
AWP segment backlog at December 31, 2016 decreased approximately 11% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2015. This decrease from the prior year was primarily due to lower fleet orders from large North American rental customers.
The backlog at our Cranes segment decreased approximately 21% from December 31, 2015. This decrease from the prior year was driven by the impact of low oil prices in North America and Middle East and caution in Europe tied to reduced wind power subsidies in Germany.  Foreign exchange negatively impacted 2016 backlog by approximately 1% when compared to 2015.
Our MP segment backlog at December 31, 2016 increased approximately 45% from December 31, 2015. The increase in backlog over the prior year was primarily due to strong demand for concrete products in the U.S. and timing of orders for crushing and screening products. Foreign exchange negatively impacted 2016 backlog by approximately 7% when compared to 2015. 
Corporate and other backlog at December 31, 2016 decreased approximately 47% from December 31, 2015, primarily due to disposition of our midi/mini excavators, wheeled excavators, compact wheel loaders, and components product lines in 2016. 
DISTRIBUTION
We distribute our products through a global network of dealers, rental companies, major accounts and direct sales to customers.
AERIAL WORK PLATFORMS
Our aerial work platform, telehandler and light tower products are distributed principally through a global network of rental companies, independent distributors and, to a lesser extent, strategic accounts. We employ sales representatives who service these channel partners from offices located throughout the world.
CRANES
We market our crane products globally, optimizing assorted channel marketing systems, including a distribution network and a direct sales force. We have direct sales, primarily to specialized crane rental companies, in certain crane markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, France, Scandinavia and China to offer comprehensive service and support to customers. Distribution via a distributor network is often utilized in other geographic areas, including the United States and Canada where we also sell directly to key accounts.
We sell utility equipment to the utility and municipal markets through a direct sales effort in certain territories and through independent distributors in North America. Outside of North America, independent distributors sell our utility equipment directly to customers.
MATERIALS PROCESSING
We distribute our products through a global network of independent distributors, rental companies, major accounts and direct sales to customers.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
We maintain engineering staff primarily at our manufacturing locations to conduct research, development and engineering for site-specific products. We have also established competency centers that support entire segments from single locations in certain fields such as control systems. Our businesses also assess global trends to understand future needs of our customers and help us decide which technologies to implement in future development projects. In addition, our engineering center in India supports our engineering teams worldwide through new product design, existing product design improvement and development of products for local markets. Continually monitoring our materials, manufacturing and engineering costs is essential to identify possible savings, then leverage those savings to improve our competitiveness and our customers’ return on investment. Our research, development and engineering expenses are primarily incurred to develop (i) additional applications and extensions of our existing product lines to meet customer needs and take advantage of growth opportunities, and (ii) customer responsive enhancements and continuous cost improvements of existing products.
12

Our engineering focus mirrors the business priorities of delivering customer responsive solutions, growing in developing markets, complying with evolving regulatory standards in our global markets and applying our lean manufacturing principles by standardizing products, rationalizing components and strategically aligning with select global suppliers. Our engineering teams in China and India represent our commitment to engineering products for developing markets. They take equipment technology from the developed markets and translate it to appropriate technology for developing markets using the experience and cultural understanding of engineering teams native to those markets.
Product change driven by regulations requiring Tier 4 emissions compliance in most of our diesel engine powered machinery has been an important part of our engineering priorities over the last several years and will continue to play a role in product development programs through 2017, although such role will be increasingly diminished as we move forward. We have increased our emphasis on creating new models and meeting the demands of our customers. We have also focused on producing more cost-effective product solutions across various segments.
Costs incurred to develop new products and improve existing products remained relatively flat in 2016 as compared to 2015, but decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to completion of much of our Tier 4 conversion work, fewer project bids and the positive effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We will continue our commitment to appropriate levels of research, development and engineering spending in order to meet our customer needs, uphold competitive functionality of our products and maintain regulatory compliance in all the markets that we serve.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11,300 employees (excluding approximately 6,800 MHPS employees); including approximately 4,900 employees in the U.S. Approximately one percent of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. Outside of the U.S., we enter into employment contracts and collective agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. We generally consider our relations with our employees to be good.
PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
We use proprietary materials such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade names in our operations and take actions to protect these rights.
We use several significant trademarks and trade names, most notably the Terex®, Genie®, Demag® and Powerscreen® trademarks. The other trademarks and trade names that we use include registered trademarks of Terex Corporation or its subsidiaries. Demag® is a registered trademark of Demag IP Holdings GmbH, which is a joint venture owned 50% by Terex and 50% by Konecranes.
We have many patents that we use in connection with our operations, and most of our products contain some proprietary technology. Many of these patents and related proprietary technology are important to the production of particular products; however, overall, our patents, taken together, are not material to our business or our overall financial results.
Currently, we are engaged in various legal proceedings with respect to intellectual property rights. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our business or operating performance. For more detail, see “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
As part of The Terex Way, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our team members, and strive to provide quality products that are safe to use and operate in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner.
We generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations would also impose liability for costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances, should any of such events occur. We are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment, machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards. Each of our manufacturing facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every five years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations. We are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. For example, we continue to reduce lost time injuries in the workplace and work toward a world-class level of safety practices in our industry.
We are dedicated to product safety when designing and manufacturing our equipment. Our equipment is designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their markets. We continually incorporate safety improvements in our products. We maintain an internal product safety team that is dedicated to improving safety and investigating and resolving any product safety issues that arise.
The use and operation of our equipment in an environmentally conscious manner is a priority for us. We are aware of global discussions regarding climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. We are increasing our production of products that have lower greenhouse gas emissions in response to both regulatory initiatives and anticipated market demand trends. For example, starting in 2010, one of our most significant design priorities was to include Tier 4 emission compliant diesel engines in our machinery. This continued to be a priority in 2016 and will continue to play a role in our product development programs through 2017 (although such role will be diminished going forward) as we move through the engine-horsepower dependent phase-in of Tier 4 regulations across our diesel-engine equipped products. We manufacture a utility truck that uses plug-in electric hybrid technology to save fuel, reduce emissions and reduce noise in residential areas.

Increasing laws and regulations dealing with the environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding safety and the environment has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures. We currently do not expect these expenditures to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND EXPORT SALES
Information regarding foreign and domestic operations, export sales and segment information is included in Note C – “Business Segment Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
SEASONAL FACTORS
Terex is a globally diverse company, supporting multiple end uses. Seasonality is a factor in some businesses, where annual purchasing patterns are impacted by the seasonality of downstream project spending. Specifically, our businesses can experience stronger demand during the second quarter, as customers in the northern hemisphere make investments in time for the annual construction season (April to October).
Non-seasonal macro factors are also important, however, and can surpass seasonal influences in importance in some years. Entering 2017, for example, we would expect the overall economic environment to have greater influence on our sales than historical seasonal trends. Industry-specific factors, like the AWP replacement cycle, will also be an important, non-seasonal driver of customer demand.
WORKING CAPITAL
Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding to purchase production and replacement parts inventories, capital expenditures to repair, replace and upgrade existing facilities, as well as funding to finance receivables from customers and dealers. We have debt service requirements, including semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding notes and quarterly interest payments on our bank credit facility. We believe cash generated from operations, together with availability under our bank credit facility and cash on hand, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business. We will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities, including reducing costs and working capital, reviewing alternatives for under-utilized assets, and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth opportunities.
