ITEM 1. Business
General
Apyx Medical Corporation (“Company”, “Apyx Medical”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1982, under the laws of the State of Delaware and has its principal executive office at 5115 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, FL 33760.
We are an advanced energy technology company with a passion for elevating people’s lives through innovative products in the cosmetic and surgical markets. Known for our innovative Helium Plasma Technology, Apyx is solely focused on bringing transformative solutions to the physicians and patients we serve. Our Helium Plasma Technology is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, fascial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. The J-Plasma® system allows surgeons to operate with a high level of precision, and virtually eliminating unintended tissue trauma. We also leverage our deep expertise and decades of experience in unique waveforms through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers. 
On August 30, 2018, we closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with Specialty Surgical Instrumentation Inc., a Tennessee Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Symmetry Surgical Inc. (“Symmetry”), pursuant to which we divested and sold our electrosurgical "Core" business segment and related intellectual property, including the Bovie® brand and trademarks, to Symmetry for gross proceeds of $97 million in cash. The divestiture and sale of our Core business segment to Symmetry has allowed us to further focus on our strategic objective of commercializing our Helium Plasma Technology, including the expansion of our Renuvion® brand in the cosmetic surgery market.
Our objective is to achieve profitable, sustainable growth by increasing our market share in the Advanced Energy category, including the commercialization of products that have the potential to be transformational with respect to the results they produce for surgeons and patients. In order to achieve this objective, we plan to leverage our long history in the industry, along with the reputation for quality and reliability that our brand enjoys within the medical community.
While our revenues were affected by the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the latter half of 2020 we saw strong utilization of our Renuvion® handpieces from existing customers in the U.S., along with shipments to several new customers in our international markets, which helped to offset sluggish global demand for capital equipment. Throughout the year, we continued our efforts to support our customers during this challenging time. 
While we were also pleased to see overall improvements in our Advanced Energy business trends during the third and fourth quarters, demand for handpieces remains uneven across, and within, the primary markets that we serve, and global demand trends for generator adoption remain in the early stages of recovery. Although the timing of a return to a more normalized environment remains uncertain, we remain cautiously optimistic with respect to the continued recovery of the cosmetic and plastic surgery market. 
Subject to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to see trends leading to year-over-year growth in our U.S. Advanced Energy business in the fourth quarter 2020, and year-over-year growth in our international Advanced Energy business in early 2021. We remain well-capitalized and well-positioned to weather the continued impacts of COVID-19, while investing in our primary initiatives to drive strong, long-term growth in the global cosmetic and plastic surgery market as the recovery continues.

APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

this growth is driven by social and cultural factors such as the influence of social media, peer pressure for appearance and beauty, and increasing disposable income.
We believe that Apyx Medical has sustainable, competitive advantages in the cosmetic market for several reasons: our long history of developing unique energy devices to meet the needs of physicians, our unique Helium Plasma Technology, and our outstanding product quality supported by strong engineering and research and development capabilities. We believe that our equipment and devices have, and will continue to improve, the lives of doctors and their patients. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on our intellectual property that we have developed or acquired over the years including patents, trade secrets, technical innovations and various licensing agreements to provide our future growth and build our competitive position. We have been issued 39 patents in the United States and 27 foreign patents. We have 13 pending patent applications in the United States and 36 pending foreign applications. We have 8 U.S. registered trademarks and 1 pending U.S. trademark application. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, we believe it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We are committed to producing the most technically advanced and highest quality products of their kind available on the market. We manufacture the majority of our products on our premises in Clearwater, Florida and at our facility located in Sofia, Bulgaria, both of which are certified under the ISO international quality standards and are subject to continuing regulation and routine inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulations relating to our quality system, medical device complaint reporting, and adherence to FDA restrictions on promotion and advertising.

Our Two Business Segments 
We currently have two reportable segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. The Corporate and Other category includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to any reportable segment. Net assets are shared, therefore, not allocated to the reportable segments.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our OEM segment contributed 19.8% of our consolidated total revenue and our Advanced Energy segment contributed 80.2% of our consolidated total revenue.
Advanced Energy Segment
Overview
Our product portfolio consists of our Helium Plasma Technology that is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. The J-Plasma® system allows surgeons to operate with a high level of precision, virtually eliminating unintended tissue trauma. This technology has U.S. FDA clearance, CE mark, and clearance for sale in multiple other countries and is generally indicated for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit ("ESU"), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. The proprietary radiofrequency ("RF") energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. This technology has been the subject of thirty eight peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, abstracts, and posters. It also continues to be the subject of numerous presentations at traditional and cosmetic surgery conferences around the world.
This technology initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December 2014, which enables us to sell the product in the European Union. In 2014, we created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to sell this technology. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for our Helium Plasma Technology with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, developing product line extensions and expanding the specialties in which this technology can become the “standard of care“ for certain procedures.
During 2020, we continued our full-scale commercialization efforts for Renuvion®. As of December 31, 2020 we had a direct sales force of 31 field-based selling professionals and utilized 2 independent sales agencies. We also had 5 sales managers. This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion® into physicians' practices.
From 2015 through 2020, we launched numerous new extensions to our Helium Plasma product lines in an effort to target new surgical procedures, users, and markets. Most notably, in early 2020 we launched our Renuvion® APR handpieces which were designed with improved ergonomics and usability for our Renuvion® customers. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives, we have significantly increased the number of physicians using our Helium Plasma Technology by expanding usage to include the cosmetic surgery market in the U.S., and the cosmetic surgery market as well as the surgical oncology market outside the U.S..
In order to assist us in leveraging our Helium Plasma Technology's precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, in 2019 we added 4 additional doctors to our Medical Advisory Board, which currently consists of 5 members representing the plastic surgery, facial plastic surgery, and cosmetic procedure specialties.
Our commercial strategy in the U.S. is primarily focused on advancing the usage of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market. In our international markets, we focus on both the cosmetic surgery, and on our J-Plasma® technology for the surgical oncology market. We continue to develop a clinical and regulatory strategy, and corresponding marketing campaigns, to support our market focus. 
We continue to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our Renuvion® technology for the long-term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders, and this may adversely affect our short-term profitability and cash flows, particularly over the next 12 to 18 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that our Helium Plasma Technology will continue to be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized.
Customers
In the U.S., we primarily sell our Renuvion® products through our direct sales force to physicians, cosmetic surgery offices and surgical centers. Outside of the U.S., all of our products are sold primarily through our distributor network.
Products
Our Advanced Energy Products consist of our Helium Plasma Technology lines (Renuvion® and J-Plasma®). These product lines consist of a multifunction generator, a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency ("RF") energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy. 
Helium Plasma Generator
In early 2020, we launched the newest versions of our Helium Plasma generator – The Renuvion System 3 and J-Plasma System 3 generators. These are high frequency electrosurgical generators that can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. These new generators were built for use with our Renuvion APR handpieces and feature enhanced capabilities such as a joule counter, capable of displaying energy delivered to the patient, and new Auto-Bipolar functionality, which expands surgical capabilities of the system. These new product releases continue to expand the procedure base for our Helium Plasma Technology by providing surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations and perform specific procedures.
Disposable Portfolio
We offer a variety of different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices has been shown to provide increased precision and control and cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The two primary specialties that are targeted are the cosmetic surgery and surgical oncology markets. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that surgical applications are just one area of opportunity for this technology. During 2020, we launched our new generation APR hand pieces, designed specifically for percutaneous use, with improved ergonomics and safety features. 
Competition
Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are RF based competitors, argon plasma competitors, and CO2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2020.
OEM Segment 
Overview
We leverage our expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing generators and related accessories for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy-based designs. In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Symmetry Surgical, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for a ten-year term, whereby we will manufacture certain products and sell to them at agreed upon prices. Revenue, costs and expenses resulting from this agreement are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of income or loss from operations of our OEM reporting segment.
