ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of the Business
Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (“Franklin Electric” or the “Company”) is an Indiana corporation founded in 1944 and incorporated in 1946. Named after America’s pioneer electrical engineer, Benjamin Franklin, Franklin Electric manufactured the first water-lubricated submersible motor for water systems, and the first submersible motor for fueling systems. With 2020 revenue of about $1.2 billion, the Company designs, manufactures and distributes water and fuel pumping systems, composed primarily of submersible motors, pumps, electronic controls and related parts and equipment.
The Company’s water pumping systems move fresh and wastewater for the residential, agricultural, and other industrial end markets. The Company also sells various groundwater equipment products to well installation contractors, including water pumping systems, through its distribution branches located in the U.S. With a growing global footprint, the Company has also evolved into a top supplier of submersible fueling systems at gas stations, making pumps, pipes, electronic controls, and monitoring devices.
The Company’s products are sold worldwide by its employee sales force and independent manufacturing representatives. The Company offers normal and customary trade terms to its customers, no significant part of which is of an extended nature. Special inventory requirements are not necessary, and customer merchandise return rights do not extend beyond normal warranty provisions.
Franklin Electric’s Key Factors for Success
While maintaining a culture of safety and lean principles, Franklin Electric promises to deliver quality, availability, service, innovation, and cost in every encounter the Company has with stakeholders, including direct or indirect customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers. These key factors for success are a roadmap for the Company's growth as a global provider of water and fuel systems, through geographic expansion and product line extensions, leveraging its global platform and competency in system design, all while consistently offering the best value to its customer.
Markets and Applications
The Company’s business consists of three reportable segments based on the principal end market served: Water Systems, Fueling Systems, and Distribution segments. The Company includes unallocated corporate expenses in an “Intersegment Eliminations/Other” segment that, together with the Water Systems, Fueling Systems, and Distribution segments, represent the Company. Segment and geographic information appears in Note 15 - Segment and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements.
The market for the Company’s products is highly competitive and includes diversified accounts by size and type. The Company’s Water Systems and Fueling Systems products and related equipment are sold to specialty distributors and some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), as well as industrial and petroleum equipment distributors and major oil and utility companies. The Company’s Distribution segment sells products primarily to water well contractors. 
Water Systems Segment
Water Systems is a global leader in the production and marketing of water pumping systems and is a technical leader in submersible motors, pumps, drives, electronic controls, and monitoring devices. The Water Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells motors, pumps, drives, electronic controls, monitoring devices, and related parts and equipment primarily for use in groundwater, water transfer and wastewater. 
Water Systems motors, pumps and controls are used principally for pumping clean water and wastewater in a variety of residential, agricultural, municipal and industrial applications. Water Systems also manufactures electronic drives and controls for the motors which control functionality and provide protection from various hazards, such as electrical surges, over-heating and dry wells or dry tanks. In the last two years, the Company acquired First Sales, LLC and Waterite, Inc., expanding its portfolio to include water treatment systems.
Water Systems products are sold in highly competitive markets. Water Systems contributes about 60 percent of the Company’s total revenue. Significant portions of segment revenue come from selling groundwater and surface pumps, motors, and controls for residential and commercial buildings, as well as agricultural sales which are more seasonal and subject to commodity price changes. The Water Systems segment generates approximately 35 to 40 percent of its revenue in developing markets, which often lack municipal water systems. As those countries install water systems, the Company views those markets as an 
opportunity. The Company has had 6 to 9 percent compounded annual sales growth in developing regions in recent years. Water Systems competes in each of its targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and services, performance, availability, and price. The Company’s principal competitors in the specialty water products industry are Grundfos Management A/S, Pentair, Inc., and Xylem, Inc.
2020 Water Systems research and development expenditures were primarily related to the following activities:
•Electronic variable frequency drives and controls for Pump and HVAC applications, including SubDrive Connect Plus, SubDrive Utility 3 Phase, and Cerus X-Drive including HES (High Efficiency Systems) motor support
•Greywater pumping equipment, including the new High Temperature Condensate Pump Series and expanded FPS Non-Clog products up to 20 horsepower
•Submersible and surface pumps for residential, commercial, municipal, and agricultural applications including the development of a standard global 4” pump family and the integration our new recently acquired lineshaft turbine product offerings
•Submersible motor technology and motor protection, including expanded scope of the MagForce™ HES (High Efficiency Systems) from 1-335 horsepower
•Water Treatment products focused on a new commercial valve and IOT enabled sensing systems
Fueling Systems Segment
Fueling Systems is a global leader in the production and marketing of fuel pumping systems, fuel containment systems, and monitoring and control systems. The Fueling Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells pumps, pipe, sumps, fittings, vapor recovery components, electronic controls, monitoring devices and related parts and equipment primarily for use in fueling system applications.
Fueling Systems offers a complete array of components between the tank and the dispenser, including submersible pumps, station hardware, piping, sumps, vapor recovery and electronic controls. The Fueling Systems segment growth has been sustained by a commitment to protecting human health and the environment while delivering the lowest total cost of ownership. Fueling Systems takes steps to ensure its products are installed and maintained properly through robust global certification tools for their third-party contractors. The segment serves other energy markets such as power reliability systems and includes intelligent electronic devices that are designed for online monitoring for the power utility, hydroelectric, and telecommunication and data center infrastructure.
Fueling Systems products are sold in highly competitive markets. Rising vehicle use is leading to more investment in fueling stations which, in turn, leads to increased demand for the Company’s Fueling Systems products. The Company believes there is growth opportunity in developing markets. Fueling Systems competes in each of its targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and services, performance, availability, and value. The Company’s principal competitors in the petroleum equipment industry are Vontier Corporation, formerly a part of Fortive Corporation, and Dover Corporation.
