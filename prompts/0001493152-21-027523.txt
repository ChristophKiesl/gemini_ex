Along with the establishment of PHILUX Global Funds, since March 2018 the Company has worked closely with the Authority of Chu Lai Open Economic Zone and the Provincial Government of Quang Nam, Vietnam to develop the Asia Diamond Exchange.

CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP
 
In August 2021, PHI Group signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia-based CYFS Group, headed by Mr. Choky Fernando Simanjuntak, to sponsor and co-found CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP to implement a new disruptive carbon mitigation initiative through environmentally sustainable projects starting in Indonesia, Vietnam, other ASEAN countries, and worldwide. On September 21, 2021 CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP was incorporated as a Wyoming corporation to manage this program. PHI Group will contribute a major portion of the development budget and will hold 50.1% shares of CO2-1-0 (CARBON).
 
According to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), together with the Paris agreement and Kyoto protocol in 2016, where Indonesia has actively participated and agreed to maintain the earth temperature not to exceed by 1,5 degrees Celsius by 2030. The greenhouse gases (GHG), mainly CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs, are the root cause of global climate change, each of which can be calculated as CER (CO2 Emission Reduction) equivalent. The target for Indonesia is 834 million tonnes of CER by 2030.
 
Currently, CER is being tediously registered, validated, and certified centrally under UNFCCC methodology by a few independent institutions, mostly in the US and Europe, where the CER later can be traded (as carbon credits) voluntarily. For the past 5 years, the market for carbon credits is nearly zero, and due to complexity of the processes, many companies/ projects have less appetite to be engaged into the carbon credit opportunity. Many environmentally sustainable projects (renewable energy/ waste/ agriculture/forestry/ etc.) have failed to get financial support especially at the initial/ development stage, due to the above reasons, causing less economic value of the project or delays.
 
Though the carbon market is still on hibernate stage, CER value is estimated to rise to US$ 100/ ton CER by 2030, while crypto currency is just starting and has attracted many millennials and gen-Z who are more aware to green environment and sustainability (recent survey result, Indonesian college students, 12-13 July 2021). It is believed that from year 2022 onward the world will witness the boom of renewable energy projects/ sustainability initiatives that are related to Carbon Credits, with an enormous market size of 23 Giga tones of CO2 emission to be reduced in 2030. The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International Finance (IIF) with knowledge support from McKinsey, estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Overall, the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion in 2030.
 
CO2-1-0 (CARBON) aims to provide a solution in disruptive decentralized new carbon market system using blockchain technology which will be empowering environmentally sustainable projects (renewable energy/ waste/ agriculture/ forestry/ etc.) starting in Indonesia, Vietnam, other ASEAN countries and worldwide. It has a clear and systematic product development roadmap, and the ultimate milestones of the products estimated to be launched in the near future. The solution, methodology, and improved TACCC (transparent, accurate, consistent, complete, and comparable) business process originally introduced by CO2-1-0 (CARBON) will bring full impact to better environment and life of millions.
