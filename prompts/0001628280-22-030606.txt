Company Overview
The Company is a professional services company that architects and builds enterprise value in consumer facing brands to generate scalable performance driven revenue growth. The Company delivers three solutions pillars that: CREATE brands and experiences and CONNECT consumers through emerging technology products and ecosystems to deliver PERFORMANCE based measurable business outcomes. 
Business Solutions Pillars
The Company now provides the three brand and customer acquisition solutions through one unified organization that has three core “Business Solutions Pillars”: 
•Brand Building and Activation
•Marketing Innovations and Enterprise Technology
•Performance and Customer Acquisition
The Company’s Business Solutions are designed to be executed as standalone or integrated activations with an unified go-to-market approach.
The Company generates revenue principally from two material revenue streams: Managed Services and Performance Solutions. 
The Company’s Managed Services are typically orientated around the management of a customer’s marketing, data, and/or creative program. The Company’s deliverables relate to the planning, designing, and activating of a solution program or set of work products. The Company executes this revenue stream by leveraging internal and external creative, technical or media-based resources, third party advertising technology ("AdTech") solutions, proprietary business intelligence systems, data delivery systems, and other key services required under the terms of a scope of work with a client. 
The Company’s Performance Solutions are typically orientated around the delivery of a predetermined event or outcome to a client. Typically, the revenue associated with the event (as agreed upon in a scope of work) is based on a click, lead, call, appointment, qualified event, case, sale, or other defined business metric. The Company engages in a myriad of consumer engagement tactics, digital and offline ecosystems, and customer acquisition methods to generate a consumer’s interest in a particular service or product. 
Enterprise Organization
The Company is structured as a matrixed organization with four operational and business quadrants: 
•Enterprise Planning and Operations
•Knowledge and Technical Services
•Client Acquisition and Thought Leadership
•Business Consulting Solutions 
This matrix structure is capable of delivering a financially efficient organization that democratizes technical and planning resources.
Scale
We excel at generating highly scalable customer acquisition and retention programs in high value products and services across several strategic sectors. The Company generates resilient enterprise brand value and revenues for its clients, having orchestrated thousands of mass scale campaigns and sales programs for some of the leading companies in the United States. 
Sector Expertise
The Company provides its turnkey solutions in the following sectors: 
•Consumer Products and Services
•Entertainment and Media 
•Sports and Betting
•Financial and Professional Services
•Education
•eSports and Gaming
The Company’s Business Solutions are architected to service other sectors that have a B2C focus with a need for high lifetime value customers.
Headquarters
The Company is headquartered in New York, New York with satellite offices in Los Angeles, California and Westchester County, New York. 
Converge Acquisition
In March 2022, the Company acquired Converge Direct, LLC and its affiliates for a purchase price of $125.0 million. Converge was founded in 2006 and became a leading customer acquisition and business measurement partner for large brands in the entertainment, financial and professional services, education, leisure, and home services verticals. The Converge Acquisition enables the Company to provide performance-based customer generation capabilities powered by Converge’s business intelligence know-how, data, and technology capabilities. 
The Converge Acquisition has proven to be the catalyst for the Company’s transformation into an integrated consulting and solutions business which is now built upon Converge’s proven growth, operational model, and tenured team members. The Converge Acquisition has created a platform, powered by a new executive and management team (and recomposed Board of Directors), to establish an intelligently connected solutions organization that can build upon Converge’s revenues of $294.0 million and Income from Operations of $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (pursuant to Converge’s audited financial statement). 
Converge’s resilient growth since 2017 (and during COVID-19) was based on demand for its performance-based customer acquisition and business intelligence programs across its digital and offline mediums, first party data, and digital brand products. Most notably, Converge’s revenue growth in the home services and professional services sectors during COVID-19 continues to power the Company’s growth potential and scalability which can be easily translated across various new business sectors. 
Converge grew to an eighty (80) person operation, at the time of the Acquisition, with offices in New York City, NY, Westchester County, NY, and San Diego, CA. Converge’s co-founder, Tom Marianacci, is now the Head of Acquisitions and Performance, former Member Mike Carrano holds the position of Executive Director of Acquisition and Performance, and Sadiq (Sid) Toama is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Board Director. 
Company Strategy
Business Strategy 
Our business strategy is to build upon Converge’s success and revenues by continuing its unwavering focus on performance driven business outcomes and delivering hyper measurable outcomes that is underwritten by our enterprise technology and analytics expertise. The Company is now able to complement the core capabilities of the Converge Acquisition to deliver the other key attributes of a successful customer engagement business.
Our business purpose, as an organization, and our value to shareholders is to continue to build and grow the business to: 
•Deliver measurable enterprise value to our clients through deployment of innovative and future proof Brand Strategy, Enterprise Technology and Performance Marketing; 
•Architect, deploy and manage measurement ecosystems for our clients to measure our impact and the impacts of other headwinds and tailwinds in their business;
•Deliver high intent and high lifetime customers;
•Generate sustainable and cost-effective customers whilst mitigating market volatility acting as our clients’ customer acquisition insurance partner;
•Offer flexible and risk mitigating business models that are innovative and reward us for our investment in our clients’ businesses;
•Activate a disciplined focus on Sector expertise to help clients intelligently scale their businesses and be able to focus on what they do best;
•Introduce best technical and strategic practices across our Sectors for our clients and for ourselves as thought leaders and activation engineers;
•Develop full, vertically integrated brands that create rich first party data that can be monetized through intelligent lead and data distribution to the most valuable buyers;
•Build and deploy licensable brands and digital products for clients who wish to manage their own lead formula on a self-serve basis;
•Expand our core solutions into complementary sub-verticals; and
•Focus on engagements and cross-brand partnerships that produce outcomes: if our clients win, we win. 
Our integrated Performance Solutions enable us to put our own skills and expertise in play and to be compensated when our clients win. Our solutions become incremental to current client activity and soon become part of a core growth strategy that clients find difficult to replace. We do this across all facets of our business solutions and our Knowledge Services capabilities. 
The new organizational mantra is “to do for ourselves what we do for our clients”; ultimately, we believe there is no better way to build a robust internal value system than to replicate the way in which we help our clients for our own continued growth. 
Knowing Our Clients
Our focus is always on knowing (and continuing to better understand) our clients and what keeps them up at night. Our dedication to a disciplined order, method, and routine when it comes to discovery allows us to get the most crucial insights into our clients’ businesses. We also know that our clients consist of an array of functions which allows us to deploy our mix of multi-functional experts to complement external stakeholders. 
We focus on practical and scalable technology and data activations to leverage decision sciences to transform our business and those of our clients. Our clients' businesses are in constant flux which increases the need for perpetual discovery. We closely partner with our clients to analyze multi-touch data across their business data mesh to report, diagnose, prescribe, and activate optimization strategies to maximize investments in creative, media, and customer offerings to drive sales growth. 
Agnostic Approach
Our technology and marketing channel agnostic philosophy allows us to deploy diversified solutions for our clients that consider macro- and microeconomic and technical headwinds and opportunities to generate strong return on investment and protect downside risk. 
We can build custom programs and measurement strategies to help clients whether they are in growth or risk management stages in their lifecycle by offering performance solutions. We do this to help minimize their exposure to media, client CRM 
inconsistencies, and other customer acquisition unknowns such as call centers, supply chain, and business model hazards. We are not a lead generation marketplace as we continue to act as consultants to our clients in providing thought leadership and solutions capabilities to solve our clients’ custom challenges.
Human Capital Resources
As a company that is made up of technical functions and talent, our processes and our people are our standout superpowers. We are committed to a culture of shared success, investing in our people to provide them with opportunities across our organization and help them achieve their personal objectives. No different to our business value to our clients, we continuously seek to bring our analytics focus to measure, diagnose, and prescribe the best paths forward for our people. Our matrixed organization, where our people report to their function and to the project, enables our teams to get a broad reach into multiple functions and insights across the Company to increase the lifetime value for both parties. This approach enables the Company to provide long-standing and stable services powered by people who really do know their clients through shared processes. 
The Company has attracted, and continues to attract, talented and diverse team members during the recent transformation of the business. The Company’s focus has been to introduce talent from all sectors (finance, sports, banking, and technology sectors) to build upon its creative, media, and analytics talent pool. Due in part to these efforts, the Company's workforce has grown from 96 employees in July 2021 to approximately 208 employees as of June 30, 2022. As of September 12, 2022, the Company employs 134 individuals across the globe.
The Company continues to work with its newly structured Board of Directors to architect attractive compensation strategies for its new look organization. 
Revenue Generation
We generate revenue by merging our brand architectural teams, our technology powered consumer engagement capabilities, and media reach to deliver our clients' commercial objectives such as customer acquisition, consumer engagement, or profit driven outcomes. We do this using insights from internal and external data markers that we manage through Helix, our Business Intelligence platform. Helix allows us, our partners, and clients to make diagnostic and prescriptive business decisions efficiently and measure business and operational impacts to continually optimize our performance. 
In doing so, we are able to provide different revenue generating programs. We are typically compensated on a negotiated “per lead,” “per call,” or other “per business action” basis that ultimately is architected by us with due regard for supply and demand factors and subject to there being a viable and scalable engagement opportunity for all parties concerned. Our higher margin business engagements are powered by executing customer acquisition and engagement programs across a range of channels and mediums whereby we take on the cost of paying digital search companies, third-party media sources, affiliate marketing platforms, content aggregators, data providers, and other strategic partners to generate consumer engagement both on digital devices and in the physical home or property.
We can unify our creative, technology, and performance acquisition capabilities to power all our different revenue streams. As a long-standing customer acquisition partner for large advertisers, we can leverage our media and technology economies of scale to power our more lucrative revenue streams. The symbiosis of our revenue streams combine to create the best of both worlds for us to continue to grow in the media, creative, and technology verticals. Ultimately, this is our competitive advantage and as we continue to build on the long-standing partnerships, we are best suited to take advantage of our unified Create, Connect, and Perform strategy. 
The Company generates revenue by providing consulting and solutions for its clients that include: 
•Design, build and execution of brand building;
•Activation of brand strategy and amplification across multiple consumer engagement channels and mediums;
•Extending brand engagement into emerging technologies and ecosystems (Web3, metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality);
•Generation of incremental client revenue and awareness through brand licensing, partnerships, and audience extensions;
•Implementation of enterprise technology to measure the impact of the Company’s Business Solutions Pillars; 
•Architecting and delivering analytics solutions to help brands through descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics;

•Generating consumer opt-in to receive product and services offers from brands;
•Monetization of first party data and consumer traffic;
•Building and executing omnichannel and multi-medium customer acquisition and retention programs on a performance basis;
•Monetization of consumer leads generated through our own brands and digital ecosystems; and
•Implementation of customer acquisition and retention technologies and operational enhancements for clients. 
Consumer Acquisition and Engagement
Having acquired Converge, our now integrated strategy supports our agile competitive standing in the marketplace. Our media buying power, proprietary technologies, consumer data aggregation, and business intelligence solutions create further opportunities to scale the Company's revenue in the sectors we serve. We are able to deploy our turnkey solutions to further grow revenue due to the following attributes: 
•Our deep data capabilities and operational business experience in our client sectors;
•Our years of media and customer acquisition know-how across multiple channels; and
•Our ability and agility at orchestrating hundreds of simultaneous programs, campaigns, and engagement tactics allow us to optimize our test and learn strategy to take advantage of lucrative opportunities.
Because of our deep expertise in online and offline mediums, we can effectively trade the market for consumer traffic and data source, partners of whom generate high-intent and unbranded media. 
Our consumer engagement programs garner consumer data points and traffic in several ways: 
•Email campaigns; 
•SMS campaigns;
•Internal Brand and Client Brand in organic or search engine optimization (“SEO”) websites;
•Targeted search engine marketing (“SEM”);
•Pay-per-click (“PPC”) campaigns;
•Pay-per-call (“PPCL”) campaigns;
•Social and web3 community ecosystems;
•Prospect, internal, and third-party email programs;
•Call center operations; and
•Online and offline media partnerships.
Our reach continues to be an attractive commercial and risk mitigation proposition for our clients. We add value due to our diverse and flexible multi-channel capabilities that help our programs to minimize market fluctuations and take advantage of optimization opportunities. Clients pay us for the actual opt-in actions by visitors or customers that result from our marketing activities on their behalf, versus traditional impression-based advertising and marketing models in which an advertiser pays for a broad audience’s exposure to an advertisement.
We continue to build on our long-standing client partnerships in the cost or impression marketing models in which our clients are responsible for the costs of media impressions to a wide scale audience across online and offline mediums. The Company is strategically positioned to marshal clients from traditional account-based media engagements and into outcome-based performance solutions and vice versa dependent on market conditions and business needs for all parties. 
Transparency
Due to our agnostic approach to AdTech, marketing technology ("MarTech"), and customer acquisition ecosystems, we can provide clients transparency into the decisions and recommendations that we make. We have prioritized the “why we do things” above “how we do things” to ensure that clients and partners are not limited in the spectrum of solutions that we offer due to exclusivity of services and financial arrangements with our partners and ecosystems. 
The Company executes its customer acquisition solutions across multiple scalable channels and mediums such as email, SMS, display, video, audio streaming, digital Out of Home, Search Engine Marketing, Social, Affiliate, Direct Mail, Linear TV, Linear Radio, and Print Inserts. The Company’s enterprise technology expertise spans all major AdTech and MarTech ecosystems, including Google (Elite Marketing Partner), Bing, The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, Facebook, TikTok, and other 
leading digital service providers. The Company’s technology footprint spans NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce, AWS, and Adobe. 
Industry Overview, Market Opportunities and Competitive Landscape
Industry Overview
The Company's consulting and solutions services are designed to fulfill three key client outcomes: (1) build enterprise value in brands, (2) generate resilient, scalable, and performance-driven revenue growth, and (3) retain customers and maximize their value. The Company powers these outcomes through a myriad of services that span:
(i)    Brand Building and Activation; 
(ii)    Marketing Innovation and Enterprise Technology; and
(iii)    Performance and Customer Acquisition.
The Company’s channel agnostic capabilities in the engagement and acquisition of consumers by offering a dual solutions stream, enables it to expand its total addressable market. The Company operates in diverse sectors that are complementary across consumer audiences. The sectors are curated to mitigate the macro- and microeconomic but also to leverage the relative scale of those sectors and market geographies. 
Market Opportunities
The restructuring of the Company and its new focus positions the business into a strong standing to take advantage of the following market opportunities: 
•The need for our clients to shift from a traditional marketing focus;
•A desire for clients to measure the impact of their tangible and intangible sales and marketing investments;
•A need for enhanced operational capabilities for clients maximizes their customer acquisition systems and strategies;
•Rethinking the role of our client’s marketing functions;
•A desire to deploy enterprise technology across our clients’ businesses;
•Providing incremental customer sales activity and expertise to clients without disturbing their operations;
•The need for a unified business intelligence ecosystem that enables all stakeholders to make decisions based on prescriptive and predictive analytics; and
•Support investments in brands by private equity to rapidly deliver sales growth and leverage scalable business models such as franchise or dealer-based businesses. 
While the digital consumer engagement space is ever expanding, the Company’s ability to activate its customer acquisition programs across both digital and offline mediums, at scale, continues to be a market opportunity for the Company. Clients are continually looking to explore greenfield opportunities to find new customers, utilize rich first party data to target consumers who extend their audience cohorts, and to have a trading partner who can leverage marketing opportunities where costs fluctuate.
The increasing complexities and challenges in the labor market focus our clients on their core product or service development and activation; this shift provides opportunities for the Company to grow our Create, Connect, and Perform capabilities. 
The Company’s opportunity to pivot its core competency to customer retention and reengagement results creates a scalable market opportunity for us to expand our impact to our clients. The Company expects retention and reengagement solutions to be an incremental revenue opportunity as clients work to maximize their customer acquisition investments. 
Competitive Landscape
The Company Business Solutions Pillars, Revenue Segmentation, and solutions mix are most comparable with AdTech and MarTech businesses such as EverQuote, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVER), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE: SLQT), LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE), QuinStreet, Inc. (NASDAQ: QNST), Digital Media Solutions, Inc (NASDAQ: DMS), and Fluent, Inc (NASDAQ: FLNT) but with lesser risk exposure to a single industry and Business Solutions Pillars than some of these comparable businesses. 
Who We Compete With
Our primary competitors are traditional advertising and creative agencies and digital customer acquisition marketing and media entities. Our competition with our peers is orientated around the value we get for our marketing investment (or our clients’), cost of marketing, cost of technology, addressable media, targeting data costs, scalable media, and consumer engagement and consumer acquisition provenance and compliance. Our competitors can also be our clients who wish to utilize our know how, consumer data, or customer leads for their own monetization. Similarly, our competitors may also be a source of consumer traffic to our customer acquisition programs. 
Technology 
The Company has, as a result of the Converge Acquisition, acquired and continues to design and develop its technology capabilities and products. We build and provide technology, data, and analytics as part of our overall solutions offerings for current and new clients. 
Our continued focus on technology, including our proprietary business intelligence platform Helix, allows us to deploy surveillance systems across our consumer engagement programs to better manage and optimize decisions to enhance cost efficiencies. 
The Company deploys internally developed data and software systems as well as third party leading enterprise systems for internal and external projects. The Company utilizes customized and integrated technologies for a variety of workstreams including: 
•Consumer engagement management;
•Performance Management;
•Web and mobile ecosystems;
• Media planning and strategy;
•Program optimization; and 
•Data aggregation. 
The Company continues to build upon its long-standing enterprise data know-how to design and deploy technology systems for itself and its clients to leverage optimization levers to make better business decisions more quickly and to measure the impact of the same. 
The Company’s focus continues to make data accessible to key stakeholders and to have a solid descriptive and diagnostic analytics foundation to execute predictive and prescriptive business optimizations across all revenue generating programs. 
Regulatory
Federal, state, and industry-based regulations impact the businesses of our customers and our partners and, in turn, impact our revenues. Increased regulations can cause customers to reduce their expenditures and thus, their advertising budgets, which can potentially lower our revenues. Changes in consumer privacy laws and the impact of those changes in the digital world can have impacts on the Company and its ability to engage with consumers. The Company’s ability to utilize consumer data and transmit consumer preferences to clients and partners are paramount to its success.
Given that we interact with consumers across online and offline mediums, we, along with our partners, clients, and service providers, are subject to many federal and state laws and regulations, including restrictions on the use of unsolicited commercial email, such as the CAN-SPAM Act and state email marketing laws, and restrictions on the use of marketing activities conducted by telephone, including the Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. 
Our business is also subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding user privacy, search engines, Internet tracking technologies, direct marketing, data security, data privacy, pricing, sweepstakes, promotions, intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, export of encryption technology, acceptable content and quality of goods, and taxation, among others.
Further, we also operate in certain sectors that have their own compliance and regulatory frameworks such as insurance and legal. In our financial services client vertical, our websites and marketing services are subject to various federal, state, and 
local laws, including state licensing laws, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair acts and practices, and federal and state advertising laws. The costs of compliance with these regulations and new laws may increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with such laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
Macroeconomic Conditions
During 2020, the U.S. economy increasingly suffered the adverse effects of the COVID-19 economic and health crisis. Macroeconomic factors, such as the level of interest rates, credit availability, and the level of unemployment, including during economic downturns and global pandemics, could all have an adverse impact on our customers’ costs of services and their demand for our services and our revenues. Any difficulties faced by our customers due to hardships in the economy could cause a reduction in their advertising budgets as they seek to manage expenses in general. Conversely, to an extent, we believe that the digital media advertising industry is also counter-cyclical to macroeconomic conditions since some customers increase their advertising and promotion efforts in times where consumers are more difficult to acquire. This enables us to ease the downward impact on our revenues during a downturn in the economy.
We also believe that we are well suited to take advantage of an economic downturn due to (a) our business being focused on measurable business outcomes versus brand awareness, (b) our trading capabilities across multiple channels and tactics to take advantage of easing media costs, and (c) our ability to leverage sectors that promote financial benefits and costs savings to consumers. We saw growth in the Converge business during the COVID-19 pandemic of approximately $238.0 million for year ended December 31, 2020, and $294.0 million for year ended December 31, 2021, due to the Performance revenue stream promoting clients to test our services due to the financial risk mitigation that this solution offers (pay lead or appointment etc). In addition, we have also been able to take advantage of consumers being at home who are engaging with our home services and home improvements client offerings. 
Intellectual Property
The Company has registered trademarks on the following names: Fundamentals, The Power of Fandom, Entertain Change, and several pending marks. To protect its proprietary rights, the Company relies on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with its employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions with our partners, licensees, and other third parties.
