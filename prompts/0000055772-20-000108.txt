Overview
Kimball International was incorporated in Indiana in 1939. Our corporate headquarters is located at 1600 Royal Street, Jasper, Indiana. For over 70 years, Kimball International has created design driven furnishings that have helped our customers shape spaces into places, bringing possibility to life by enabling collaboration, discovery, wellness, and relaxation. We go to market through our family of brands: Kimball, Kimball Health, National, Etc. by National, Kimball Hospitality, and D’style by Kimball Hospitality. Our values and high integrity are demonstrated daily by living our purpose and guiding principles that establish us as an employer of choice. We build success by growing long-term relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.
We have been in the furniture business since 1950. Our end markets include the workplace, health and hospitality markets. Our workplace end market includes sales to the commercial, financial, government and education vertical markets. Through each of our brands, we offer a wide range of possibilities for creating functional environments that convey just the right image for each unique setting, as furniture solutions are tailored to the specific end user’s needs and demands. The workplace is evolving to optimize human interaction, and Kimball and National provide residentially inspired furniture solutions. While our rich heritage of wood craftsmanship remains, our new product portfolio incorporates the use of mixed materials, satisfying the marketplace’s need for multi-functional, open accommodations throughout all industries. Our furniture solutions are used in collaborative and open work spaces, conference and meeting/huddle rooms, training rooms, private offices, learning areas, classrooms, lobby/reception areas, and dining/café areas with a vast mix of wood, metal, laminate, paint, fabric, solid surface, and plastic options. To accommodate new ways of working we have added divider screens that are intended to reduce the spread of pathogens while enhancing existing products and blending new solutions into the workplace. As the need to work from home continues, we are offering new solutions to help redefine the future of work by building a work-from-home portfolio. In addition, we offer products designed specifically for the health market, such as casegoods and seating for patient exam rooms and lounge areas. In response to COVID-19, Kimball and National designed quick response programs that offer a broad furniture portfolio with quick-ship options. These pre-configured solutions offer easy-to-order and quick-to-receive vignettes for a variety of spaces. In 
the hospitality industry, Kimball Hospitality works with leading designers, purchasing agents, and hotel owners to create furniture that extends the unique ambiance of a property into guest rooms and public spaces by providing furniture solutions for hotel properties and mixed use commercial and residential developments. Hospitality products include, but are not limited to, headboards, tables, seating, vanities, casegoods, lighting, and products enhanced with technology features utilizing a broad mix of wood, metal, stone, laminate, finish, glass, and fabric options. 
Recent Business Changes
‘Kimball International Connect’ Strategy
In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company’s full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and position our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. We believe this strategy will result in enhanced shareholder value over the long term. 
Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars:
▪Inspire Our People: Leveraging our legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are working to cultivate a high-performance, caring culture. We unveiled our new purpose to our employees on May 9, 2019 and are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work.
▪Build Our Capabilities: We created center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal and centralized supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting new ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. To achieve our goals, we established a Program Management Office to oversee execution.
▪Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices. 
▪Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including health and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers’ first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share. 
‘Kimball International Connect 2.0’ Strategy
In August 2020, Kimball International announced Connect 2.0, which centers around accelerating our growth. The four pillars of our previously announced strategy remain constant: inspire our people with a purpose driven and high performance culture, build our capabilities by expanding our work on innovation, fuel our future through the dedication to cost savings, and accelerate our growth. Connect 2.0 is designed to accelerate the growth of Kimball International and enable us to effectively manage through the current economic downturn, by driving market share gains as well as yielding additional cost savings. The Company will be reorganized into four market centric business units which are Workplace, Health, Hospitality, and eBusiness that will accelerate our ability to redesign and reimagine the new workplace, build a new work from home portfolio, continue assembling experts in health, and expand our hospitality business into other commercial direct sales environments. The dedicated eBusiness unit will take a leadership role in establishing all e-commerce across our brands and end markets. Each of these four business units will be supported by the agility and efficiency of Global Operations and the streamlined center-led structure that we implemented in year one of our strategy and the transformation restructuring plan described below. 
Transformation Restructuring Plan
In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan has established a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. The transformation restructuring plan includes the following: 
•We reviewed our overall manufacturing facility footprint to reduce excess capacity and gain efficiencies by centralizing manufacturing operations. We ceased operations at a leased seating manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia, consolidated a David Edward production facility in Red Lion, Pennsylvania into our Baltimore, Maryland facility.
•The creation of center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions resulted in the standardization of processes and the elimination of duplication. In addition, we centralized our supply chain 
efforts to maximize supplier value and plan to drive more efficient practices and operations within our logistics function.
•Kimball brand selling resources were reallocated to higher-growth markets. We also ceased use of four leased furniture showrooms across our brands during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and recognized impairment of the lease and associated leasehold improvements. Additional impairment was recognized in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to degradation of sublease expectations resulting from the current economic environment. 
These efforts, which are substantially complete except for subleasing of exited showrooms, generated pre-tax savings of approximately $10.5 million in fiscal year 2020. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we recognized $8.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of pre-tax restructuring expense. 
Transformation Restructuring Plan Phase 2
In August 2020, we announced the second phase of our transformation restructuring plan that will align our business units to a new market-centric orientation and is expected to yield additional cost savings that will enable us to effectively manage through the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan builds on the initial strategy and the transformation restructuring plan announced in June 2019. The following is a summary of the activities we will be undertaking pursuant to phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan:
•As part of the previously announced plan to consolidate manufacturing of all brands into one world-class global operations group, we are streamlining our manufacturing facilities by leveraging production capabilities across all facilities, establishing centers of excellence, and setting up processes to facilitate flexing of product between facilities in response to volume fluctuations. We are also reviewing our overall facility footprint to identify opportunities to reduce capacity and gain efficiencies.
•As discussed above as part of our Connect 2.0 strategy, the Company will be reorganized into four market centric business units which are Workplace, Health, Hospitality and eBusiness. 
•We will streamline our workforce to align with the new organizational structure and respond to lower volumes created by the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a more efficient organization to deliver on our Connect 2.0 strategy. 
Phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan will begin immediately, and we expect a substantial majority of the underlying activities of these aforementioned actions to be completed within two years.
We currently estimate we will incur total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $17.0 million to $18.0 million related to the initiatives under phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan. 
Acquisition of David Edward Furniture, Inc. (“David Edward”)
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified limited liabilities of David Edward headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. David Edward is a premier designer and manufacturer of contract furniture, sold in the health, corporate, education, and premium hospitality markets. David Edward products are generally specified by architects and sold primarily in the North American market. The David Edward collection by Kimball consists of classic and contemporary designs, focused primarily in the seating, tables, and ancillary furniture categories. In conjunction with the asset acquisition, we leased two existing David Edward production facilities in Baltimore, Maryland and Red Lion, Pennsylvania. The cash paid for the acquisition totaled $4.3 million. We consolidated the David Edward production facility in Red Lion, Pennsylvania into our Baltimore, Maryland facility near the end of our fiscal year 2020 as part of our transformation restructuring plan. Our focus is on investing in new equipment and a redesigned layout in Baltimore that will allow us to substantially increase capacity, improve efficiency, reduce lead times, and deliver on the high design, high quality products. See Note 3 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition. 
Acquisition of D’style, Inc.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we acquired certain assets of D’style, Inc. (“D’style”), headquartered in Chula Vista, California. The acquisition expanded our hospitality offerings beyond guest rooms to public spaces and provided new mixed material manufacturing capabilities. As part of this acquisition, we also acquired all of the capital stock of Diseños de Estilo S.A. de C.V. headquartered in Tijuana, Mexico, another member of the D’style group which manufactures exclusively for D’style, strengthening our North American manufacturing footprint and serving as a distribution channel to the Mexico and Latin America hospitality markets. The cash paid for the acquisition totaled $18.2 million. 
Outsourcing of Shipping Function
During fiscal year 2018, we outsourced the remainder of our outbound shipping that was previously transported by our Company-owned shipping fleet to a dedicated freight provider and sold our fleet of over-the-road tractors and trailers. The outsourcing to a dedicated freight provider partially mitigated increased transportation costs during fiscal year 2018 from non-dedicated freight carriers. The dedicated freight provider operates transportation equipment with our Company branding. We continue to operate Company-owned tractors and trailers to move products between our production facilities and distribution warehouses.
Seasonality
The impact of seasonality on our revenue includes lower sales to educational institutions during our second and third fiscal quarters, lower sales of hospitality furniture during times of high hotel occupancy such as the summer months, and lower sales in our third fiscal quarter due to the buying season of the government.
Locations
As of June 30, 2020, our products were primarily produced at ten Company-owned or leased manufacturing facilities: six located in Indiana, two in Kentucky, one in Maryland, and one in Mexico. We also engage with third-party manufacturers within the U.S. as well as internationally to produce select finished goods and accessories for our brands. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, near the end of our fiscal year 2020, we exited our leased manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia, and are evaluating our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities. 
As of June 30, 2020, nine furniture showrooms were maintained in six cities in the United States. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, we ceased use of four of our furniture showrooms during our first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Office space is leased in Dongguan, Guangdong, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to facilitate sourcing of select finished goods and components from the Asia Pacific Region. We lease office and manufacturing space in Baltimore, Maryland, Chula Vista, California and Tijuana, Mexico. We exited the Red Lion, Pennsylvania leased facility near the end of our fiscal year 2020 as that facility was consolidated into our Baltimore, Maryland facility.
Financial information by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020 is included in Note 18 - Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Marketing Channels
Our furniture is marketed to end users by both independent and employee sales representatives, office furniture dealers, wholesalers, brokers, designers, purchasing companies, catalog houses, and eCommerce services. Customers can access our products globally through a variety of distribution channels. 
We currently categorize our sales by the following end markets: 
Workplace - Our workplace end market includes sales to the commercial, financial, government and education vertical markets. We are a full-facility provider offering products for a variety of commercial applications including: office, collaborative and open plan, lobby-lounge, conferencing and meeting/huddle, training, dining/café, learning, lobby and reception, and other public spaces. Banking and financial offices require affordable, functional, and stylish environments. Our versatile and customizable furnishings offer sophisticated styles for reception areas, employee work spaces, executive offices, and boardrooms. We also supply office furniture, including desks, tables, seating, bookcases and filing and storage units for federal, state, and local government offices, as well as other government-related entities. We hold two Federal Supply Service contracts with the General Services Administration (“GSA”) that are subject to government subcontract reporting requirements. We partner with multiple general purchasing organizations that assist public agencies such as state and local governments with furniture purchases. Our education products are sold to K-12, higher education, vocational training and other learning institutions, and the products are focused on both enhancing learning and creating social environments. We offer flexible, collaborative, and technology-driven furnishings designed to make students and faculty more productive and comfortable. We equip hallways, lounges, and other gathering spaces with versatile furniture that extends learning outside the classroom with areas designed for individual, one-on-one, and larger group use. 
Health - Our health products are focused on meeting healthcare professional needs and preferences in flexible, adaptable, and collaborative spaces while putting the patient at the center of care. Our furnishings enable exam rooms to be a flexible space that can be used for consultation, telehealth and specific treatments or examinations. The products offered for areas surrounding the treatment areas are designed to be welcoming and relaxing to support the families of the patients. Our health products are offered to value-conscious healthcare customers, including hospitals, clinics, physician office buildings, long-term care facilities, and assisted living facilities throughout the country. 
Hospitality - We offer a complete package of products for guest rooms and public spaces plus service support to the hospitality industry. We partner with the most recognized hotel brands to meet their specific requirements for properties throughout the world by working with a worldwide manufacturing base to offer the best solution to fulfill the project.

Major Competitive Factors
Our products are sold in the contract furniture and hospitality furniture industries. These industries have similar major competitive factors, which include price in relation to quality and appearance, product design, the utility of the product, including adaptability and cleanability, supplier lead time, reliability of on-time delivery, sustainability, and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We offer payment terms similar to industry standards and in unique circumstances may grant alternate payment terms. 
Certain industries are more price sensitive than others, but all expect on-time, damage-free delivery. In addition to the many options available on our standard furniture products, custom furniture is produced to customer specifications and shipping timelines on a project basis. Our Kimball brand Quickship for Care program offers shipping in 5 days or less for health and wellness solutions such as mobile storage, space division products, and seating and tables for exam areas with cleanable finish options. Our National brand has a quick response program that offers a broad furniture portfolio that ships in 48 hours or delivers in 10 days or less.
 Competitors
There are numerous furniture manufacturers competing within the marketplace, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. 
Our competition includes furniture manufacturers such as Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Knoll, Inc., HNI Corporation, and a large number of smaller privately-owned furniture manufacturers, both domestic and foreign-based. 
 Working Capital
We do not believe that we, or the contract furniture or hospitality furniture industries in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our furniture business. We do receive advance payments from customers on select furniture projects, primarily in the hospitality industry.  
 Raw Material Availability
Certain components used in the production of furniture are manufactured internally and are generally readily available, as are other raw materials used in the production of wood and non-wood furniture. Certain fabricated seating components, wood frame assemblies as well as finished furniture products, electrical components, stone, fabrics, and fabricated metal components, which are generally readily available, are sourced on a global scale in an effort to provide quality products at the lowest total cost. In fiscal year 2019, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on furniture products, parts, and components. The U.S. government continues to evaluate the ongoing need for, and the amount of, tariffs, and if further or increased tariffs are assessed, the cost and availability of both domestic and foreign sourced product and components could be further impacted. The COVID-19 global pandemic has also affected both domestic and global supply chains. Disruptions have eased but if COVID-19 impacts worsen, cost and availability of raw materials could be impacted. 
 Order Backlog
The aggregate sales price of products pursuant to open orders, which may be canceled by the customer, was as follows: 

(Amounts in Millions) | June 30,2020 | | June 30,2019
Order Backlog | $ | 151.1 | | $ | 161.7

The open orders as of June 30, 2020 are expected to be filled within fiscal year 2021, with $90 million expected to be filled during our first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The decline in the order backlog at June 30, 2020 was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Open orders may not be indicative of future sales trends. 
 Intellectual Property
In connection with our business operations, we hold both trademarks and patents in various countries and continuously have additional pending trademarks and patents. The intellectual property which we believe to be the most significant to the 
Company includes: Kimball, National, D’style, David Edward, Etc.(pending), Fringe, Waveworks, Xsite, Narrate, Pairings, Respitality, and Allan Copley Designs, which are all registered trademarks, and the unregistered trademarks Priority and Whittaker. Our patents expire at various times depending on the patent’s date of issuance. 
 Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in matters of protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. Reinforcing our commitment to the environment, five of our showrooms and one non-manufacturing location were designed under the guidelines of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Commercial Interiors program. One manufacturing facility was designed using the LEED Operations and Maintenance program guidelines. Our National brand headquarters is Fitwel certified, which is a building certification that supports healthier workplace environments to improve occupant health and productivity. Our Kimball brand headquarters received the WELL Health-Safety Rating that focuses on operational policies, maintenance protocols, emergency plans and shareholder engagement strategies to help organizations prepare their spaces for re-entry in a post COVID-19 environment. 
We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment, will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the next two fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures during those years. 
Our manufacturing operations require the use of natural gas and electricity. Federal and state regulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production due to such regulations. In our wood furniture manufacturing plants, a portion of energy requirements are satisfied internally by the use of our own scrap wood produced during the manufacturing of product. 
 Employees

 | June 30,2020 | June 30,2019
United States | 2,663 | | 2,982
Foreign Countries | 145 | | 145 
Total Employees | 2,808 | | 3,127

Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 41 employees are represented by worker’s unions that operate to promote the interests of workers. We believe that our employee relations are good.
