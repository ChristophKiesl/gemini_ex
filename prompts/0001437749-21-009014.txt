General 
 
MCX Technologies Corporation (formerly McorpCX, Inc) (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is currently focused on delivering digital transformation solutions to customer-centric organizations through integrated marketing, data science, analytics, commerce, and machine learning. We were previously engaged in the more narrowly focused business of delivering consulting and professional services that were designed to help corporations improve their customer listening and customer management capabilities, often referred to as customer experience (“CX”) management solutions.
 
We were incorporated in the State of California on December 14, 2001 as a CX management solutions company dedicated to helping organizations improve customer experiences, increase customer loyalty, reduce cost and increase revenue. The Company operated as The Innes Group, Inc., d/b/a MCorp Consulting until filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation renaming the Company Touchpoint Metrics, Inc., effective October 18, 2011. On June 11, 2015, our shareholders passed a resolution to change the name of the Company to McorpCX, Inc., and on June 29, 2020, in connection with the sale of McorpCX, LLC, as described below, our shareholders passed a resolution to change the name of the Company to MCX Technologies Corporation.
 
The Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, McorpCX, LLC (“McorpCX LLC”) as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware on December 14, 2017. On August 16, 2018, the Company entered into a contribution agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary McorpCX LLC, pursuant to which the Company transferred to McorpCX LLC all of the Company’s assets and liabilities related to the Company’s customer experience consulting business, excluding the underlying technology and databases related thereto which remained with the Company.
 
Effective August 3, 2020, the Company sold all of its membership interests in McorpCX, LLC to mfifty, LLC, a California limited liability company controlled by Michael Hinshaw, the President of McorpCX LLC (the “Purchaser”). Since the Company’s professional and related consulting services business, which constituted substantially all of the Company’s operations at the time of the sale of McorpCX LLC, was conducted through McorpCX LLC, the sale of McorpCX LLC represented a strategic shift that we believe will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.
 
As consideration for the sale of McorpCX LLC, the Company received a total of $352,000 in cash consisting of $100,000 received upon the signing of the purchase agreement and $252,000 received at the closing of the transaction along with a $756,000 promissory note. The promissory note has an initial annual interest rate of 0.99% (to be recalculated at the end of each twelve-month period subsequent to the date of the note based on the annual Applicable Federal Rate for mid-term loans on the first business day following each such twelve month period) accruing daily on the outstanding balance of the note, and monthly principal payments are payable to the Company over a term of four or more years. Monthly principal payments to the Company are initially $7,292 per month for the first twelve months following the date of the note, and then during each subsequent twelve-month period are based on the annual revenues of McorpCX, LLC.  The note is secured by the Purchaser's ownership interest in McorpCX LLC.
 
On November 12, 2020, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, The Collective Experience, LLC (the “Collective Experience”) as a Delaware limited liability company. The Company is currently providing all of its customer relations management consulting services, which is the Company’s sole revenue generating operations, through the Collective Experience.
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported in Wuhan, China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the government responses to the outbreak presents uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company and its performance and financial results.
 
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic is continually evolving. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company's customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Products and Services
 
Excluding revenues derived from our consulting services provided through the operations of McorpCX, LLC, our primary revenue source in 2020 came from consulting and professional services provided through the Collective Experience, including strategy consulting, digital marketing, data science and process optimization.

Together, our services and products are expected to be designed to help organizations improve customer experiences, increase customer loyalty, reduce costs and increase revenue. We expect to serve a wide variety of industries and customer sizes.
Professional Services 
 
We provide professional and related consulting services through the Collective Experience including brand strategy, pricing science, data science, digital marketing, customer experience management consulting, implementation and go-to-market execution in support of these strategies.

Our Strategy

The Company’s management is now in the process of recreating the Company to enable it to focus on providing technology solutions for the Always-On Economy. MCX is exploring investment opportunities into three areas: digital transformation-, cryptocurrency, and decentralized finance (“DeFi”). In developing our portfolio offering, we are in the process of exploring various strategic alternatives, such as proprietary software or technology development, pursuit of mergers/acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, “white-labeling” arrangements, software licensing arrangements, and investment in additional infrastructure for our Company. Each of these possible strategies will be thoroughly vetted by our board of directors to assess the expected level of enterprise value creation for each strategy compared to the various risks associated with each possible scenario. In addition, we may require financing to pursue these strategies that are beyond our current financial resources. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to pursue any strategy identified by our board of directors.
Digital Transformation.  We are now focused on developing business transformation platforms that we expect will offer digital transformation solutions for organizations.  These services are intended to allow organizations gain more refined insights into their customers’ needs which will then be the catalyst for the development and facilitation of their product and services offerings.  Our digital transformation platform is in the process of being developed and is expected to focus on integrated marketing, data science and analytics, utilizing methods that include but are not limited to machine learning technologies.
 
Crypto-Currency. We are actively analyzing the development, and/or acquisition, of crypto-currency enabling technologies. A cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions. Potential uses for our clients could be seeking alternative forms of payment when transacting sales of its products and services.
 
Decentralized Finance. We are exploring technologies that will allow companies to transact business utilizing cyber-currencies. Decentralized finance is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum. These DeFi technologies can provide clients to exchange cyber-currencies, participate in lending and facilitate participation in predictive markets.
Competition

Given the emergence of digital transformation technologies as a priority for many organizations and service providers numerous technology companies are seeking ways to support these efforts.  Additionally, cyber-currency and DeFi have become more readily recognized as method of completing transactions and as such, more competitors are seeking to enter this marketplace. These technologies are subject to rapidly changing technological developments, shifting organizational priorities and requirements, frequent introductions of new products and services, and increased marketing and sales activities of other industry participants.
 
Many competitors exist in the overlapping areas of on-demand and traditional digital marketing, data analytics, digital transformation, cyber-currency and decentralized finance software services and consulting. Many of our current and potential competitors have a significantly larger market presence, greater name recognition, access to more potential customers and substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, management, support, and other resources than we have. As a result, many of our competitors are able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities and technologies, and may devote greater resources to the marketing, promotion and sale of their products than we can.

We believe it is highly likely that existing and new competitors will rapidly acquire significant market share, which would negatively impact our ability to effectively market, compete and sell our products and services we are currently developing into the markets in which such competitors operate.
 
Dependence on Major Customers
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had two active customers, and there are no assurances that we will be able to expand our customer base.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, such as assignment, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the technology and intellectual property used in our business.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we do not own any trademarks or service marks, patents or other intellectual property assets.
 
Insurance 
 
We maintain general liability, commercial auto, and professional liability/E&O insurance policies and director and officer insurance.

Employees 
 
At the end of 2020 we had no full-time employees and three independent contractors. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and none of our independent contractors are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreements.. We intend to hire more employees and independent contractors on an as-needed basis.
Offices 
 
We have one business addresses. Our headquarters is located at 2529 Detroit Ave, Cleveland, OH 44113.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws
 
Given the nature of the Company’s business operations, local, state and federal environmental laws do not impose any material costs or have any material effect on the Company.
Government Regulation 
 
We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses.
