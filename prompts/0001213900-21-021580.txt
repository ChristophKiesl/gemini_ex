Overview
 
At SunHydrogen, our goal is to replace fossil fuels with clean renewable hydrogen.
 
Our patented low-cost technology is intended to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, including seawater and wastewater. Unlike non-renewable hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel produces pure water as the only product. By optimizing the science of photoelectrolysis at the nano-level, our low-cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to split water molecules into renewable hydrogen. Using our low-cost method to produce renewable hydrogen, we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
 
Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant chemical element, constituting roughly 75% of the universe’s chemical elemental mass (Palmer, D. (13 September 1997). “Hydrogen in the Universe.” NASA). In its purest form, hydrogen is a non-toxic colorless and odorless gas. However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and hydrogen gas is most often produced using fossil fuels. Industrial production of hydrogen is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas and is usually employed near its production site, with the two largest applications being crude oil processing (hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. We are developing what we believe is a cleaner and greener way to produce hydrogen.
 
Hydrogen as a fuel, like electricity, is an energy carrier rather than an energy source. We believe that if hydrogen was easily accessible for the world to depend on it, the challenging global issues associated with the widespread usages of fossil fuels, such as global climate change and air pollution would be erased.
 
Over 99% of hydrogen produced today is produced using a fossil fuel, methane (natural gas) in a method called steam methane reforming (SMR). Although commercially optimized over decades, the SMR process is capital intensive and will remain so due to the fundamental nature of the process which includes: (1) three separate reactors with different catalysts operating at different temperatures, (2) large amounts of heat transfer needed for the endothermic reforming and exothermic water gas shift, and (3) the need to remove all carbon oxides using capital and energy intensive methods. (source: Nikolaidis, P.; Poullikkas, A., A comparative overview of hydrogen production processes. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 2017, 67, 597-611.)
 
Besides being capital intensive, the SMR method releases harmful levels of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air further contributing to our global climate crisis.
 
We believe renewable hydrogen is the fuel of the future. The main challenge has been the high cost of hydrogen production and transportation. We believe a low-cost distributed production technology, such as the SunHydrogen technology, is the way to enable a world of clean and renewable energy.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe we are still in the early stages of the hydrogen market, and yet, this market continues to grow exponentially. One of the reasons for this growth is the adoption of hydrogen fuel technologies within an increased number of major industries and spanning many applications.
 
Furthermore, recent government mandates for renewable energy have created a real and sustainable market opportunity for renewable hydrogen. Most states in the United States have legislative mandates to use between 10-45% of renewable energy by 2050, some states have mandates for 100% by 2050. These include California (100% by 2045), Colorado (100% by 2050), Hawaii (100% by 2045), Virginia (100% by 2050), Washington (100% by 2045), Washington DC (100% by 2032) and Puerto Rico (100% by 2050). (https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx)
 
While solar and wind electricity have been the dominate form of renewable energy, the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. Therefore, we believe a direct solar-to-hydrogen technology which immediately stores solar energy as hydrogen can turn solar energy into a primary and reliable source of energy just like coal and natural gas – but cleaner and greener.
 
Existing Market Growth 
 
According to a Global Market Insights study released in June 2019, the global hydrogen generation market size is predicted to be valued at $180 billion by 2024. Strict regulatory norms to reduce sulfur content with measures to reduce the carbon footprint is expected to drive the global hydrogen generation market size. U.S. federal and state governments have adopted various programs including the Tier 3 program to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline, motor oil, and diesel and which aims to lower the gasoline sulfur content up to 10 ppm in 2017.

Growing demand for petroleum products from developing countries is anticipated to also drive the hydrogen generation market size in the coming years. Hydrogen is used in various refining processes including hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization to crack bigger molecules into lighter ones and more usable products.
 
Strong investment for the expansion and upgrade of refineries to fulfill emission and sulfur content regulation is expected to stimulate the growth of the hydrogen generation market. Increasing heavy crude oil consumption demand will complement the industry landscape. Positive outlook towards the chemical industry including ammonia and methanol will also positively influence growth.
 
We believe increasing demand for clean fuel energy will be affected by:
 

● | Stringent government regulation towards Desulphurization of Petroleum Products
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deteriorating crude oil quality
--+--------------------------------


● | Transportation & Storage Issues
--+--------------------------------

 
It is within these industries that we believe our renewable hydrogen producing technology possesses significant early market opportunity, especially as innovation and infrastructure continue to develop.
 
Utility Scale Hydrogen Electricity
 
According to a March 2013 report from NREL, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, Hydrogen can be blended into the existing natural gas pipeline networks, thus bypassing the high cost of dedicated hydrogen pipelines in order to use hydrogen at a large scale. If implemented with relatively low concentrations, less than 5%–15% hydrogen by volume, this strategy of storing and delivering renewable hydrogen to markets appears to be viable without significantly increasing risks associated with utilization of the gas blend in end-use devices (such as household appliances), overall public safety, or the durability and integrity of the existing natural gas pipeline network. (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/51995.pdf).
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles
 
One of the most recognized applications for hydrogen fuel technologies falls within the auto manufacturing and vehicles industries. The three leading manufacturers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are in order, Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda – three internationally recognized companies. Industry reports cite the need for increased infrastructure, such as fueling stations, for the industry to garner even greater market acceptance. However, the same report indicates there will be 22.2 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles sold or leased by 2032, driving revenues upwards of $1.1 trillion.

Our Technology

Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight and Water
 
Hydrogen (H2) is the third most abundant element on earth and the cleanest fuel in the universe, (Dresselhaus, Mildred et al. (May 15, 2003). “Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Economy”). Unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O). Unfortunately, nearly no pure hydrogen exists naturally on earth and therefore must be extracted from hydrogen containing molecules like water. Historically, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy, and one that we aim to address.
 
For over a century, water electrolysis, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen due to the passage of electric current, has been a well-established technology to produce hydrogen. The produced hydrogen combusts into water that can be recycled back into nature indefinitely. However, in practice, current commercial water electrolysis technologies require considerable energy from coal-powered electricity and also require ultra-pure water to prevent fouling of the system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of hydrogen.
 
The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle
 
As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day by way of photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we cannot simply grow trees to make hydrogen.
 
If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, we believe then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision.

Water Splitting
 
In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds. So in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.
 
While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:
 

● | Energy Inefficiency — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low cost and energy efficient particle technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for Clean Water — Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology
 
Water electrolysis in its simplest form is the transfer of “input electrons” in the following chemical reactions:
 

● | Cathode (reduction): 2H2O + 2e- ® H2 + 2OH-
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Anode (oxidation): 4OH- ® O2 + 2H2O + 4 e- 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
From these equations, one can deduce that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.
 
SunHydrogen Panel™
 
Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural temperature conditions of photosynthesis, they can be housed in very low-cost reactors. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology we are developing a modular system that will enable the onsite daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation.
 
We refer to our product as the SunHydrogen Panel which is comprised of the following components:
 

1. | The Panel Housing - Novel (patent pending) device design is the first of its type to safely separate oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Our design can be scaled up and manufactured for commercial use.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The NanoParticle or Solar Cell - Our patented Our patented Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures (PAH) consists of billions of tiny solar cells in 1cm2 that are electrodeposited into a protective structure to provide the charge that splits the water molecules. In the process of optimizing our nanoparticles to be efficient and only use earth abundant materials (an ongoing process), we experimented with commercially available triple junction silicon solar cells to perform tests with our generator housing and other components. Through this experimentation, our discovery leads us to believe that we can bring a system to market utilizing these readily available cells while our nanoparticles are still being optimized. These solar cells also absorb the sunlight and produce the necessary charge for splitting the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

3. | Oxygen Evolution Catalyst - This proprietary catalyst developed at the University of Iowa is applied on the solar cell or nanoparticle and efficiently oxidize water molecule to generate oxygen gas. The oxygen evolution catalyst must be robust to withstand the long operating hours of the hydrogen generation device to ensure long lifetime. It is designed to be efficient and stable in alkaline environments.

4. | Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst - Necessary for collecting electrons to reduce protons for generating hydrogen gas, we have successfully developed a process to integrate an ultra-low loading of platinum hydrogen catalyst on foam electrodes at ten times lower loading with over 67 times higher activities.

A transparent conducive coating to protect our nanoparticles and solar cells from photo corrosion and efficiently transfer charges to catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. A polymer combination that protects the triple junction solar cells from any corrosive water environments for long lifetime of the hydrogen generation device.

6. | A concentrator equal to two suns - This inexpensive Fresnel lens concentrator to increase sunlight to equal two suns reduces our necessary footprint for a 1000 KG per day system by 40%.

Our business and commercialization plan calls for two generations of our panels or generators. The first generation being manufactured for demonstration utilizes readily available commercial solar cells, coated with a stabilizing polymer and catalysts, and inserted into our proprietary panels to efficiently and safely split water into hydrogen and oxygen to produce very pure and green hydrogen that can be piped off the panel, pressurized, and stored for use in a fuel cell to power anything electric.
 
The second generation of our panels will feature a nanoparticle-based technology where billions of autonomous solar cells are electrodeposited onto porous alumina sheets and manufactured in a roll to roll process and inserted into our proprietary panels. For this generation, we have received multiple patents and we estimate that it will produce hydrogen for less than $4 per kilogram before pressurization.
 
Our team at the University of Iowa led by our CTO Dr. Joun Lee, has reached a milestone of well over 1000 consecutive hours of continuous hydrogen production utilizing completely immersed solar cells with no external biases achieving simulated production equal to one year. We believe this to be a record for completely immersed cells. Now ready to take our technology out of the lab, we are working with several vendors to commercialize and manufacturer our first generation of renewable hydrogen panels that use sunlight and water to generate hydrogen.
 
We anticipate that the SunHydrogen Panel will be a self-contained renewable hydrogen production system that requires only sunlight and any source of water. As a result, it can be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, for local use. We believe this model of hydrogen production addresses one of the biggest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale which is the transportation of hydrogen.
 
Each stage of the SunHydrogen Panel can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small-scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house, or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community.
 
SunHydrogen Panel Manufacturing
 
We are currently working towards producing 100 demonstration SunHydrogen Panels, that will be used to display our Gen 1 technology in a number of venues throughout the United States and internationally. We anticipate that these demonstration panels will broaden national and global awareness of our new, green hydrogen generating technology. With the resulting increased interest, potential customers of our technology will be able to observe the panels’ operation first hand, and determine potential uses in their business operations.
Intellectual Property
 
On November 14, 2011, we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures, methods for their manufacture, and methods and systems for producing desired products.” On March 14, 2017, the part of the patent covering the structural design of Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures (PAH) was granted as the United States Patent No. 9,593,053B1. On April 3, 2018, the part of the patent covering the method for manufacturing PAH was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053B2. The patent protects the Company’s proprietary design and manufacturing method of a self-contained solar-to-hydrogen device made up of millions of solar-powered water-splitting nanoparticles, per square centimeter. These nanoparticles are coated with a separate patent-pending protective coating that prevents corrosion during extended periods of hydrogen production. The aim of these nanoparticles is high conversion efficiency and low cost.
 
An important aspect of the patented technology is the integrated structures of high-density arrays of nano-sized solar cells as part of hydrogen production nanoparticles. The technology enables manufacturing of ultra-thin sheets for solar-to-hydrogen production, requiring substantially less material as compared to conventional solar cells used in rooftop power applications. 

In March of 2015, we jointly filed a full utility patent application with UCSB for the “Multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cell with enhanced photovoltages.” The patent covers our semiconductor designs to enhance the photovoltages of the nano-sized solar cells in the PAH structures. The semiconductor designs stacking multiple junctions inside the PAH structures would be an efficient and economic solution for the photovoltaic and the photoelectrochemical industries. This patent was granted in Australia in April of 2018, China and Europe in March of 2019, and in the U.S. in October of 2018.
 
On December 21, 2016, we filed jointly with the University of Iowa a patent for “Integrated Membrane Solar Fuel Production Assembly” to protect the intellectual property for our generator housing system that safely separates oxygen and hydrogen in the water-splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gases. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. In September of 2017, we filed the utility patent for this important invention and prosecution is ongoing.

Strategic Partners
 
Effective September 1, 2020, we entered into a research agreement with the University of Iowa. As consideration under the research agreement, the University of Iowa will receive a maximum of $299,966 from the Company. The research agreement may be terminated by either party upon 60 days prior written notice or by either party upon notice of a material breach or default which is not cured within 90 days of receipt of written notice of such breach. This term of the research agreement runs through August 31, 2021 but may be extended upon mutual agreement of the parties.
Competition
 
Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. The current industry is heavily dominated by large players such as Air Products and Chemicals Inc. and Air Liquide.
 
Green or Renewable hydrogen can be produced through electrolyzers if they are powered by solar or wind. There has been an emergence of these companies in the past few years. ITM Power in England and Proton Onsite in Norway are two of the largest companies in this industry. If not powered by solar panels or wind power, they require external electricity most likely created by coal, gas, or oil. We believe that our process when fully developed will offer a competitive advantage as it is completely green and renewable and utilizes no external power other than the sun.
