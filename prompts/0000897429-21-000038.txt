ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Chico’s FAS, Inc.1 is a Florida-based fashion company founded in 1983 on Sanibel Island, Florida. The Company reinvented the fashion retail experience by creating fashion communities anchored by service, which put the customer at the center of everything we do. As one of the leading fashion retailers in North America, Chico’s FAS is a company of three unique brands operating under the Chico's®, White House Black Market® (“WHBM”) and Soma® brand names - each thriving in their own white space, founded by women, led by women, providing solutions that millions of women say give them confidence and joy. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 1,302 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico and the United States (“U.S.”) Virgin Islands, and sold merchandise through 68 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. We sometimes refer to our Chico's and WHBM brands collectively as our “Apparel Group” and refer to our Soma and TellTaleTM brands collectively as “Soma.” Our distinct lifestyle brands typically serve the needs of fashion-savvy women 35 years and older. We earn revenue and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic retail stores, our various Company-operated e-commerce websites, our call center (which takes orders for all of our brands), through unaffiliated franchise partners and through third-party channels. 
We utilize an integrated, omnichannel approach to managing our business. We want our customers to experience our brands holistically and to view the various retail channels we operate as a single, integrated experience rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. This approach allows our customers to browse, purchase, return or exchange our merchandise through whatever sales channel and at whatever time is most convenient. As a result, we track total sales and comparable sales on a combined basis.
We offer high quality and unique merchandise, supported by outstanding personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with household incomes in the moderate to high income level.
Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the fiscal years ended January 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2020”, “2020” or “current period”), February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019”, “2019” or “prior period”), February 2, 2019 (“fiscal 2018” or “2018”), February 3, 2018 (“fiscal 2017” or “2017”) and January 28, 2017 (“fiscal 2016” or “2016”). Each of these periods had 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2017, which consisted of 53 weeks. 
Recent Developments
    The Company experienced varying degrees of business disruptions during fiscal 2020 as a result of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic” or the “pandemic”) which had a material adverse impact on our business operations and operating results and operating cash flows during fiscal 2020. 
Throughout the fiscal year, the Company was able to navigate a changing retail landscape by leveraging its omnichannel capabilities. Chico’s FAS rapidly accelerated its transformation to a digital-first company, fast-tracking numerous innovation and technology investments which drove higher consumer engagement and a year-over-year digital revenue increase of 17.5%. Like many other retailers, the Company temporarily closed its stores for several weeks in spring 2020. Even though the stores have been reopened, most are continuing to operate under reduced hours, staffing, capacity and inventory levels and enhanced safety protocols, all of which are continuing to adversely affect traffic and sales. 
_______________________
As used in this report, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” and “Chico's FAS” refer to Chico’s FAS, Inc., a Florida corporation, and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The Company took aggressive actions to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our business by significantly reducing elements of selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses to better align operating costs with expected sales. We partnered with landlords during fiscal 2020 to obtain rent reductions and abatements of $65 million. We also suspended our quarterly dividend commencing April 2020, reduced our planned capital expenditures primarily to address only maintenance and business essential requirements, better aligned inventory receipts with expected market demand and partnered with suppliers and vendors to extend payment terms. 
Due to the uncertainty over the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of the pandemic, the material adverse impact of the pandemic may continue into our fiscal year 2021. 
Exit of Canada Frontline Operations
On July 30, 2020, Chico’s FAS Canada, Co., an immaterial subsidiary of the Company, filed for bankruptcy with the Ontario, Canada office of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy. This action resulted in the permanent closure of four Chico’s and six WHBM boutiques in Ontario, Canada. The permanent closure of the Canadian boutiques, which constitute all of the Company’s Canadian boutiques, was part of the Company’s ongoing cost-savings measures taken to mitigate the impact the pandemic and address the operational and financial challenges associated with operating in Canada. In connection with this effort, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we exited our Canada frontline operations and recorded on a net basis a non-material charge, including the realization of a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. 
Our Brands
The Company's brands, described in more detail below, are organized into three operating segments and aggregated into one reportable segment due to the similarities of the economic and operating characteristics of the brands.
Chico’s
Our Chico’s brand began operations in 1983 and primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 45 and older. The style sensibility is chic and artful, and the brand is known for color and unique completer pieces, from signature jackets to jewelry and accessories that finish the look. Chico's apparel, including the Black Label, Zenergy and Travelers collections, emphasizes an effortless, chic style, comfort and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are original and designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. 
The distinctive nature of Chico’s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18) and 4 (size 20-22). Chico’s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 3.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without investing in a large number of sizes within a single style.
Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 
White House Black Market
The WHBM brand began operations in 1985 and was acquired by the Company in September 2003. WHBM is dedicated to being a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 35 and older. WHBM offers a modern collection to support her every lifestyle moment, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics and premium denim, polished casual apparel, relaxed workwear, black and white pieces, and feminine all-occasion dresses. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections. 
WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable.
WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of patterns, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.
Soma
    The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear and loungewear products focusing on women who want solutions that are as comfortable as they are beautiful. The Soma brand's core franchises emphasize innovative styles that focus on fit and uncompromising comfort, including Enbliss and Vanishing Back bras, Vanishing Edge panties and Cool Nights sleepwear. 
    Bras range in size from 32A-46H. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range in size from extra small to extra-extra-large. 
    The Soma team develops product offerings by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma brand.
    The TellTale brand, which was developed in 2019, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie products focusing on sensuality and comfort. TellTale offers flattering fashion and quality intimate apparel, primarily focusing on lounge, every-day and special occasion bras, and their matching panties. Bras range in size from 32A-40DD.
Our Business Strategy
Our overall business strategy is focused on building a collection of distinct high-performing retail brands primarily serving the fashion needs of women 35 and older. 
In June 2020, the Company implemented a leadership transition, effective June 24, 2020, designed to strengthen and provide ongoing stability and continuity of the business, and to further support the Company’s future, including the following:
•Molly Langenstein, former President, Apparel Group, became Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and President of the Company and joined the Board;
•Bonnie R. Brooks transitioned from CEO and President of the Company to Executive Chair of the Board; and
•Director William S. Simon became lead independent director of the Board.    
In fiscal 2020, the Company took actions to rapidly transform into a digital-first company, fast-tracking numerous innovation and digital technology investments. We also enhanced our marketing efforts to drive traffic and new customers to our brands, while retaining newly acquired customers at a meaningfully higher rate than fiscal 2019. 
The primary function of the Company is the production and procurement of beautiful merchandise that delivers the brand promise and brand positioning of each of our brands and resonates with customers. To that end, we are further strengthening our merchandise and design capabilities and enhancing our sourcing and supply chain to deliver product in a timely manner to our customers while also concentrating on improvements to the quality and aesthetic of our merchandise. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders.
We pursue improving the performance of our brands by building our omnichannel capabilities, growing our online presence, managing our store base, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses, considering additional sales channels and markets, and optimizing the merchandise offerings of each of our brands. We continue to invest heavily in our omnichannel capabilities so our customers can fully experience our brands in the manner they choose.
We view our stores and Company-operated e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate, independently operated sales channels. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our primary operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center ("DC") in Winder, Georgia. Our domestic customers can return merchandise to a store or to our DC, regardless of the original purchase location. Using our enhanced “Locate” tool, we ship in-store orders from other locations directly to the customer, expediting delivery times while reducing our shipping costs. In addition, our shared inventory system, Endless Aisle, enables customers to make purchases online and ship from store. In fiscal 2019, we completed the implementation of our Buy On-Line, Pick-up In-Store (BOPIS) capability across all our brands, further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities, and in fiscal 2020, we completed the implementation of STYLECONNECTSM, our proprietary digital styling software that enables us to communicate directly with the majority of our customers, to drive the frontline business to digital fulfillment. 
We seek to acquire new customers and retain existing customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including digital marketing, social media, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, potential new merchandise opportunities, and brand extensions that enhance the current offerings, as well as through our continued emphasis on our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We also will continue to consider potential alternative sales channels for our brands, including international franchise, wholesale, licensing and other opportunities.
We continue to leverage our digital investments converting single-channel customers to be omnichannel customers, as the average omnichannel customer spends nearly 3.5 times more than a single-channel customer. 
In order to maximize the opportunities in each of our brands, we are targeting five key focus areas for 2021: 
1. Continuing our ongoing digital transformation; 
2. Further refining product through fit, quality, fabric and innovation in each of our brands; 
3. Driving increased customer engagement through marketing;
4. Maintaining our operating and cost discipline; and
5. Further enhancing the productivity of our real estate portfolio. 
Our Customer Service Model
We strive to deliver outstanding and personalized customer service to our customers through our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to our continued success. An important aspect to the successful implementation of this model includes specialized training provided to our in-store and online Stylists to help them better meet their customers’ fashion and wardrobe needs. Such needs may include help selecting clothing, intimate apparel or accessories, color and style choices, coordination of complete outfits, or suggestions as to how new pieces can add versatility to our customer’s closets. Our Stylists are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers’ preferences and to assist our customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. Our Stylists utilize tools including our personal closet feature, MY CLOSET, and STYLECONNECT to access customer purchase history and style preferences, offer personalized recommendations for new products, and connect with her via email, text or chat. These tools allow our Stylists to meet customer's needs whenever and wherever she wants to shop. 
We also serve our customers’ needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. The benefits provided are routinely evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at our brands.
•Chico’s. A Chico’s customer can join the “Passport Program” at no cost and receive additional benefits after spending a fixed amount. Features of the program include a 5% discount, exclusive offers, special promotions, free standard shipping, invitations to private sale events and advance notice regarding new arrivals.
•WHBM. With “WHBM Rewards,” a customer can join at no cost for tier-based promotions, a 5% discount after spending a specified amount, free standard shipping, special promotions and invitations to private sales based on annual spend. 
•Soma. A Soma customer can join “Love Soma Rewards” at no cost, which is a tier-based program with features including reward coupons at specified loyalty point levels, exclusive promotions and free standard shipping. 
We expect to roll out an enhanced loyalty program in fall 2021. Our loyalty programs have some of the highest participation rates in retail at over 90%. We also have some of the most loyal and long-tenured customers in retail – our Chico’s customers average well over 12 years with us; WHBM customers average over nine years; and Soma customers average over six years. 
Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores
Our boutiques are located in upscale indoor shopping malls, outdoor shopping areas and standalone street-front locations in the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Boutique locations are determined based on various factors, including, but not limited to: market and demographic characteristics, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is also sold through international franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 
Our outlet stores are primarily located in quality outlet centers. The Chico’s and WHBM brand outlets contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our brand websites and at www.chicosofftherack.com. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate.
As of January 30, 2021, we operated 1,302 retail stores in 46 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold merchandise through 68 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. The following tables set forth information concerning our retail stores during the past five fiscal years:

Further Enhancing the Productivity of our Real Estate Portfolio
In fiscal 2018, the Company announced a retail fleet optimization plan to rebalance the mix between our physical store presence and our digital network. We have continued to refine that strategy, particularly in light of the pandemic. 
Stores continue to be an important part of our omnichannel strategy, and digital sales are higher in markets where we have a retail presence, but we intend to continue rationalizing our real estate portfolio, reflecting our emphasis on digital and our priority for higher profitability standards. We are currently driving store sales with less inventory and increased productivity. We have closed 40 underperforming locations since the beginning of fiscal 2020 and ended the fiscal year with 1,302 boutiques. We will continue to shrink our store base to align with these standards, primarily as leases come due, lease kickouts are available, or buyouts make economic sense. We have strong lease flexibility with nearly 60% of our leases coming up for renewal or kick-outs available over the next three years. The Company anticipates closing 40 to 45 stores in fiscal 2021. However, with the uncertainty of the pandemic, we intend to continuously evaluate the appropriate store base in light of economic conditions and our business strategy and may adjust the openings and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise. 
Information Technology/Data Analytics
We are committed to making ongoing investments in information technology systems to support our strategies within customer, digital, omnichannel and supply chain. Our information systems enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We periodically test new technologies and platforms to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. We are migrating to an industry-leading customer database and customer marketing platform to personalize the customer journey and manage all customer communication in an effort to increase traffic across all channels and increase conversion.
Digital Commerce
    Each of our brands has a digital presence: www.chicos.com, www.chicosofftherack.com, www.whbm.com and www.soma.com. These sites provide customers the ability to shop our stores 24/7, digitally browse our inventory prior to making a trip to our stores, or locate a store near them. Customers can choose to buy online, pick-up in store (BOPIS), curbside, or have it shipped directly to them. Customers can also choose to engage with online content to learn more about the stories of how our products were made or read reviews that other customers have made on the site to help influence their purchase. We also offer many payments options including a buy now, pay later option through Afterpay.
 Our websites play a vital role in both our omnichannel strategy and the overall shopping experience of how we continuously put our customer in the center of everything we do. Many products are exclusively available online including extended sizes, additional style and color choices, premier partner brands and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available for order through our call center and through clienteling applications in our stores. We also utilize ecommerce solutions, such as ShopRunner, and are constantly exploring new digital opportunities to expand our customer base and drive sales. 
 We remain focused on our omnichannel approach through continuous optimization to all brand websites including new features, functionality, search engine optimization and content designed to improve and evolve the customer's experience. 
Marketing and Advertising 
    Our brands use industry-leading transactional data to develop targeted and effective marketing strategies. To optimize our marketing efforts and to attract new customers, we continue to shift our advertising from traditional media, instead placing more emphasis on digital media. We also use predictive modeling and advanced segmentation methodologies to drive customer retention and reactivation. 
    We use the following marketing and media-mix programs to engage current customers and attract prospective customers:
•Loyalty and rewards programs;
•Direct marketing: catalogs, postcards, email and calling campaigns;
•Digital marketing: mobile paid search, product listing ads, display banner advertising and remarketing, affiliate programs;
•Social marketing: organic and paid efforts across social platforms;
•Editorial content;
•Public relations; and
•Charitable giving and outreach programs.
    In 2021, our marketing efforts will focus on retaining existing, reactivating lapsed customers and attracting new customers to our iconic brands' differentiated positioning by leveraging retail science and tools that support segmentation and personalization.
Product Sourcing
    Our product sourcing activities are performed by a centralized shared service team that is focused on maintaining our quality standards and identifying cost-effective opportunities to improve production speed and flexibility. In fiscal 2020, China sources accounted for approximately 38% of our merchandise cost. We take ownership of merchandise either in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the U.S., or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of sale. 
    The pandemic impacted our ongoing efforts to move sourcing away from China as supply chains and travel were disrupted on a global scale.
    The majority of our merchandise is purchased through suppliers with whom we have established strategic collaborations; these key suppliers represented 80% of our purchases in fiscal 2020 with our largest supplier accounting for 13% of the total. 
 Substantial work was done to reduce the supply base starting in fiscal 2017. At the close of fiscal 2020, the supply base count was reduced by 19%. Throughout 2021, our focus will be on developing and perfecting relationships with those key suppliers. As we reach scale, we believe we will have stronger partnerships, greater control over product quality, and the ability to achieve better terms and lower costs. We intend to supplement the remaining volume with a subset of market suppliers to meet any unique needs of the Company's brands.
Merchandise Distribution
The distribution function for our brands is primarily handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country-of-export either by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is primarily shipped by truck or rail. Upon arrival at our DC, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment and direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 
Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from both the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise into the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is subsequently shipped to domestic stores or online customers.
Competition
The women’s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies and online retailers. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from our competitors.
Trademarks and Service Marks
    We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as “Marks”).
    Our Marks include, but are not limited to: CHICO’S, CHICO'S PASSPORT, ZENERGY, SO SLIMMING, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET, WHBM, WHBM REWARDS, SOMA, SOMA INTIMATES, ENTICING, COOL NIGHTS, EMBRACEABLE, ENBLISS, VANISHING, VANISHING BACK, VANISHING EDGE, LOVE SOMA REWARDS, STYLECONNECT, CHICO'S OFF THE RACK, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET OFF THE RACK AND TELLTALE. We have registered or are seeking to register a number of these Marks in the U.S, Canada, Mexico and other foreign countries.
    In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the U.S.
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and various other federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
Additionally, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding our products, including the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. 
We are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. In recent years, these controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source inventory 
Following the World Health Organization’s declaration of the pandemic on March 11, 2020, federal, state and local governments responded by implementing restrictions on travel, “stay at home” directives, “social distancing” guidance, and mandated store closures which collectively had a material adverse impact on the Company’s business operations and operating results and operating cash flows during fiscal 2020. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Federal tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change could materially impact our federal taxes and reduce profitability. We continually monitor federal tax legislative and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our profitability.
Other than as noted above, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and 
compliance requirements upon our company and which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 12,500 people, 32% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. As of the above date, approximately 89% of our employees worked in our boutique and outlet stores.
We believe the vigorous enthusiasm of our approximately 12,500 associates is one of the significant contributors to our success as a family of brands. Each and every day, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our associates and customers. 
Commitment to our Cultural Values
Our five core values shape the culture of our organization and define our Company’s character — they serve as the lens through which we make decisions for our customers, our associates and our company.
•Passion for Fashion – We inhale fashion and exhale style. It’s what we love.
•Continuously Improve and Follow Your Curiosity – Ask questions. Share something. Learn something.
•Customer Centricity – Our Customer is at the center of everything we do, both internal and external.
•Be Inspired and Inspire Others – Seek out diverse ideas and thoughts. Embrace new ways of thinking.
•Be Accountable – We are accountable to metrics. We are recognized for results.
We truly believe that on our journey to thrive as a retail organization – staying focused on these Cultural Values is critical because they help drive our daily decisions and actions.
Diversity and Inclusion 
Beginning in 2021, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) will serve a more active role in our diversity and inclusion efforts, including aligning on corporate goals.
As a company, we value the diverse experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds of our associates and customers. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment that celebrates individuality, influences our culture, and innovates the way we work.
We have three main target areas within diversity and inclusion: Inclusion and Retention, Education and Training, and Customer Focus.
We believe that, to increase retention, associates must have a sense of belonging, not only on their individual teams but within the Company. We focus on campus events and celebrations, networking opportunities, recognition, and associate network groups to enhance our culture and provide a sense of belonging for associates. We also conduct training on unconscious bias, the impact of inclusion, cultural awareness, and racial equity. In addition, we have established a vision for the Company focused on our customers’ confidence and joy.
We recognize the diversity of our associates and communities in which we live, work, and play and believe in fostering an inclusive environment that celebrates our individuality, influences our culture and innovates the way we work. Under the oversight of our Board, our Diversity and Inclusion Council is dedicated to creating an understanding of the power of individuality and inclusion. This is accomplished through events, such as our 21-day Racial Equity Habit Building Challenge, which was a series of events that promoted bonding among team members through sharing of perspectives and impactful personal experiences. We proudly celebrate Black History Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, Pride Month, Veterans Day, Women’s History Month and Asian American Pacific Islander Month.
We believe that inclusion is a growth strategy and provides a competitive advantage. We invite all associates to self-identify their ethnicity, gender and veteran status enabling the Company to build our inclusion roadmap and allow us to accelerate meaningful goals to support diversity and inclusion. 
Talent Acquisition
Our National Store Support Center in Fort Myers, Florida is headquarters to our corporate operations focusing on supporting our 1,302 retail locations. 
With stores throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and franchise locations in Mexico, as well as an online presence for each of our brands, it takes sophisticated technology, resources and infrastructure to ensure our continued 
success. From finance and accounting to technology, human resources and merchandising careers, we offer diverse opportunities for talented professionals. We are an equal opportunity employer.
Learning and Development
We believe that continuous learning is key to associate growth and development. We provide associates access to our online Chico’s FAS University, which includes multiple learning opportunities to grow their skills and careers. These engaging opportunities include instructor-led classes, both virtual and classroom, and self-led content such as articles, eLearnings, and videos. Learning and Development is infused in every part of our associate experience, beginning with onboarding and throughout their career at the Company.
Total Rewards
Our Company’s philosophy is to provide competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our associates. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, short-term incentives, retirement programs, and a long-term incentive plan based on position/role.
The success of the business is connected to the well-being of our associates. In addition to medical coverage, we offer eligible associates dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, employee assistance programs, voluntary short-term and long-term disability and term life insurance. We also have on-site health and fitness centers at our Company headquarters and distribution center locations. Additionally, we offer a 401(k) plan with a Company funded match.
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the pandemic, we implemented significant changes determined to be in the best interest of our associates, as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes offering associates the option of working remotely while at the same time, implementing substantial safety measures for associates continuing on-site work in our stores and offices. We also developed a COVID-19 focused hotline offering advice and direction to successfully guide our associates through the unchartered waters brought by the pandemic. The hotline affords our associates with continual updates to changes in Company polices as well as guidance and support for unique personal situations related to the pandemic. 
Communication and Engagement
We value our associates and recognize the importance of their contributions. We believe that effective communication among all associates is a major factor in our success. We strongly believe that our success depends on associates understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including Company-wide “All Hands Meetings” with the Executive team, frequent email communications and associate pulse surveys. Our corporate intranet provides news and information on associate services such as on-site cafes, childcare facility, fitness center, healthcare clinic, auto repair and detailing services, dry cleaning, personal shipping/mail services, corporate discounts and other amenities and services.
