The WPS segment includes workplace safety and compliance products, which are sold under multiple brand names through catalog and digital channels to a broad range of MRO customers. Approximately half of the WPS business is derived from internally manufactured products and half is from externally sourced products. 
Below is a summary of sales by reportable segments for the fiscal years ended July 31:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
IDS | 71.9 | % | | 71.0 | % | 70.6 | %
WPS | 28.1 | % | | 29.0 | % | 29.4 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

ID Solutions
Within the ID Solutions segment, the primary product categories include:

• | Facility identification and protection, which includes safety signs, pipe markers, labeling systems, spill control products, lockout/tagout devices, and software and services for safety compliance auditing, procedure writing and training.


• | Product identification, which includes materials and printing systems for product identification, brand protection labeling, work in process labeling, and finished product identification.


• | Wire identification, which includes hand-held printers, wire markers, sleeves, and tags.


• | People identification, which includes name tags, badges, lanyards, and access control software.


• | Patient identification, which includes wristbands and labels used in hospitals for tracking and improving the safety of patients.


• | Custom wristbands used in the leisure and entertainment industry such as theme parks, concerts and festivals.

Approximately 65% of ID Solutions products are sold under the Brady brand. In the United States, identification products for the utility industry are marketed under the Electromark brand; spill-control products are marketed under the SPC brand; and security and identification badges and systems are marketed under the Identicard, PromoVision, and Brady People ID brands. Wire identification products are marketed under the Modernotecnica brand in Italy and lockout/tagout products are offered under the Scafftag brand in the U.K.; identification and patient safety products in the healthcare industry are available under the PDC Healthcare brand in the U.S. and Europe; and custom wristbands for the leisure and entertainment industry are available under the PDC brand in the U.S. and the B.I.G. brand in Europe. 
 The ID Solutions segment offers high quality products with rapid response and superior service to provide solutions to customers. The business markets and sells products through multiple channels including distributors, direct sales, catalog marketing, and digital. The ID Solutions sales force partners with end-users and distributors by providing technical application and product expertise.
This segment manufactures differentiated, proprietary products, most of which have been internally developed. These internally developed products include materials, printing systems, and software. IDS competes for business principally on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Competition is highly fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering minimal product variety, to some of the world's largest major adhesive and electrical product companies offering competing products as part of their overall product lines.
 ID Solutions serves customers in many industries, which include industrial manufacturing, electronic manufacturing, healthcare, chemical, oil, gas, automotive, aerospace, defense, mass transit, electrical contractors, leisure and entertainment and telecommunications, among others.
Workplace Safety 
Within the Workplace Safety segment, the primary product categories include:

• | Safety and compliance signs, tags, and labels.


• | Informational and architectural signage.


• | Asset tracking labels.


• | First aid products.


• | Industrial warehouse and office equipment.


• | Labor law compliance posters.

Products within the Workplace Safety segment are sold under a variety of brands including: safety and facility identification products offered under the Seton, Emedco, Signals, Safety Signs, SafetyShop, Signs & Labels and Pervaco brands; first aid supplies under the Accidental Health and Safety, Trafalgar, and Securimed brands; warehouse supplies and industrial furniture under the Runelandhs brand; wire identification products marketed under the Carroll brand; and labor law compliance posters under the Personnel Concepts and Clement brands.
The Workplace Safety segment manufactures a broad range of stock and custom identification products, and also sells a broad range of related resale products. Historically, both the Company and many of our competitors focused their businesses on catalog marketing, often with varying product niches. However, the competitive landscape has changed with the continued evolution of digital channels. Many of our competitors extensively utilize e-commerce to promote the sale of their products. A consequence of this shift is price transparency, as prices on non-proprietary products can be easily compared. Therefore, to compete effectively, we continue to focus on developing dynamic pricing capabilities, enhancing customer experience, and providing compliance expertise as these are critical to convert customers from traditional catalog channels to digital. Workplace Safety primarily sells to businesses and serves many industries, including manufacturers, process industries, government, education, construction, and utilities.
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations include the Asia Die-Cut and European Die-Cut businesses ("Die-Cut"), which were announced as held for sale in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, respectively. In fiscal 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with LTI Flexible Products, Inc. (d/b/a Boyd Corporation) for the sale of Die-Cut. The first phase of the divestiture closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and the second phase of the divestiture closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The operating results of the Die-Cut, businesses were reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended July 31, 2015 for the second phase of the divestiture.
The Die-Cut business consisted of the manufacture and sale of precision converted products such as gaskets, meshes, heat-dissipation materials, antennaes, dampers, filters, and similar products sold primarily to the electronics industry with a concentration in the mobile-handset and hard-disk drive industries.
Research and Development
The Company focuses its research and development ("R&D") efforts on pressure sensitive materials, printing systems and software, and it mainly supports the IDS segment. Material development involves the application of surface chemistry concepts for top coatings and adhesives applied to a variety of base materials. Systems design integrates materials, embedded software and a variety of printing technologies to form a complete solution for customer applications. In addition, the research and development team supports production and marketing efforts by providing application and technical expertise.
The Company owns patents and tradenames relating to certain products in the United States and internationally. Although the Company believes that patents are a significant driver in maintaining its position for certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents continues to evolve and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for up to 20 years according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant, depending upon the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The Company's tradenames are valid ten years from the date of registration, and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis.
The Company spent $39.6 million, $35.8 million, and $36.7 million on its R&D activities during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in R&D spending in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year was due to increased spending on new product development, as well as increased headcount. As of July 31, 2017, 234 employees were engaged in R&D activities for the Company, an increase from 210 as of July 31, 2016.
Operations
The materials used in the products manufactured consist of a variety of plastic and synthetic films, paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments, natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers, and solvents for consumable identification products in addition to electronic components, molded parts and sub-assemblies for printing systems. The Company operates coating facilities that manufacture bulk rolls of label stock for internal and external customers. In addition, the Company purchases finished products for resale.
The Company purchases raw materials, components and finished products from many suppliers. Overall, we are not dependent upon any single supplier for our most critical base materials or components; however, we have chosen in certain situations to sole source, or limit the sources of materials, components, or finished items for design or cost reasons. As a result, disruptions in supply could have an impact on results for a period of time, but we believe any disruptions would simply require qualification of new

suppliers and the disruption would be modest. In certain instances, the qualification process could be more costly or take a longer period of time and in rare circumstances, such as a global shortage of critical materials or components, the financial impact could be material. The Company currently operates 39 manufacturing and distribution facilities globally.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Generally, custom products are made to order while an on-hand quantity of stock product is maintained to provide customers with timely delivery. Normal and customary payment terms range from net 10 to 90 days from date of invoice and varies by geographies. 
The Company has a broad customer base, and no individual customer is 10% or more of total net sales. 
Average delivery time for customer orders varies from same-day delivery to one month, depending on the type of product, customer request, and whether the product is stock or custom-designed and manufactured. The Company's backlog is not material, does not provide significant visibility for future business and is not pertinent to an understanding of the business.
Environment
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws during fiscal 2017 did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
As of July 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 6,300 individuals. Brady has never experienced a material work stoppage due to a labor dispute and considers its relations with employees to be good.
