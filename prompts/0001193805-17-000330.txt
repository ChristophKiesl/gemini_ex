Business of ADMA
 
Overview
 
ADMA Biologics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases.
Our Lead Product Candidate – RI-002
 
We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, or PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to Respiratory Syncytical Virus, or RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product.
 
In the third quarter of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted for review our Biologics License Application, or BLA, for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. We have also continued to work with our third-party contract manufacturer, Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Seller or BPC, and on January 23, 2017 we announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from BPC in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest AG, or Biotest, in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter and other matters at the manufacturing facility.
 
We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA for PIDD, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative regulatory processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses.

Evaluation of PIDD Patients
 
PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014.
 
The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion.
 
RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI, reported. RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of ≤ 1 SBI per patient-year.  
 
On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins.
 
Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients
 
RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients.
 
We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002’s predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial.
 
From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patients following FDA approval, if received, for treatment of PIDD.
 
Commercialization
 
While we are working towards remediating the Warning Letter and other deficiencies and eventually filing the BLA resubmission for RI-002, we expect to continue our commercialization efforts and plan to increase our initiatives by hiring a small, specialty sales force to market Nabi-HB™ (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human) upon closing the BPC acquisition anticipated during the first half of 2017, and Bivigam™ (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human) upon its relaunch and RI-002 once approved by the FDA, to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations.  We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management.  If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to assist with order fulfillment for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals.
Intellectual Property
 
During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled ‘Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,’ which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015, our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002’s antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price.
Plasma Collection Facilities
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002. Our plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia received FDA approval in the third quarter of 2015. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the U.S., and other locations where we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open "spot" market. We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest and its U.S. subsidiary, BPC, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002. At the same time, we granted Biotest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East.
Leadership
 
The founders of ADMA have combined greater than 60 years of experience marketing and distributing blood plasma products and devices. With our executive team, members of the board of directors and our commercial team, we collectively possess over 200 years of deep medical, technical, development and commercial experience in the biologics and pharmaceutical industry.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish a specialty sales force to commercialize RI-002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | explore other possible indications (label expansion) for RI-002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | develop additional plasma-derived products for the treatment and/or prevention of infectious diseases in immune-compromised patient populations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expand our network of ADMA BioCenters facilities, both to maintain control of a portion of our raw material supply and to generate additional revenue through the collection and sale of source plasma to third party customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leader in developing and commercializing specialized, targeted, plasma-derived therapeutics to extend and enhance the lives of individuals who are naturally or medically immune-compromised.
 
The key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal are as follows:
 

· | Obtain FDA approval of RI-002 as a treatment for PIDD. In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review a BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and CMC deficiencies at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. We have also continued to work with our third-party contract manufacturer, BPC, and on January 23, 2017 we announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from BPC in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest, in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding Warning Letter and other deficiencies at the manufacturing facility.

We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA for PIDD, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative regulatory processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved.
 

· | Commercialize RI-002 as a treatment for PIDD. We plan to increase our hiring initiatives of a small, specialty sales force to market RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment and infusion center organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management. We may also use a network of national distributors to fulfill orders for RI-002.

· | Expand RI-002’s FDA-approved uses. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA as a treatment for PIDD, we plan to evaluate the clinical and regulatory paths to grow the RI-002 franchise through expanded FDA-approved uses. We believe that there may be patient populations beyond PIDD that would derive clinical benefit from RI-002 some of which may be eligible for orphan status. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop additional plasma-derived products. Our core competency is in the development and commercialization of plasma-derived therapeutics. We believe there are a number of under addressed medical conditions for which plasma-derived therapeutics may be beneficial. Utilizing our intellectual property patent, which includes our proprietary testing assay and other standardization methods and technologies, we have identified potential new product candidates that we may advance into preclinical activities in the near term. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop and expand ADMA BioCenters. In order to maintain partial control of our raw material supply as well as generate revenues in advance of RI-002’s commercialization, we formed ADMA BioCenters, a subsidiary that operates plasma collection facilities in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia. The Norcross and Marietta facilities hold FDA licenses, along with GHA and MFDS certifications. Under the FDA licenses, ADMA BioCenters may collect normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma. We sell a portion of our normal source plasma to buyers in the open “spot” market. We also plan to use the high-titer RSV plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters in the commercial manufacturing of RI-002. We may initiate other hyperimmune plasma collection programs at the Norcross and Marietta facilities. These programs would be initiated during the normal course of business and are expected to cost approximately $2 million to implement. We may also consider growth through the creation and licensing of additional ADMA BioCenters facilities in various regions of the U.S. Additional ADMA BioCenters may allow us to cost-effectively secure additional high-titer RSV plasma for RI-002, and potentially increase revenues through the collection and sale of normal source plasma and other hyperimmune plasma to third parties.

Summary of Proposed Acquisition of Certain Assets of BPC
 
On January 21, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioManufacturing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”), entered into a definitive Master Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Purchase Agreement”) with Seller, and for certain limited purposes set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Biotest and Biotest US Corporation, a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Biotest (together with Biotest AG, the “Biotest Guarantors”), pursuant to which Buyer has agreed to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities constituting the therapy business of Seller (the “Business”). We refer to the foregoing transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement collectively as the “Proposed Acquisition.” The Business includes (a) a FDA-licensed immune globulin manufacturing and plasma products production facility of two buildings of approximately 126,000 square feet located on approximately 15 acres of land in Boca Raton, Florida, and the associated real property, (b) all exclusive rights to FDA licensed biologics products Nabi-HB®, BIVIGAM® and the investigational product CIVACIR®, (c) in-process inventory with an agreed-upon value of at least $5.0 million, (d) certain other properties and assets used exclusively in the Business, and (e) certain additional assets which relate to both the Business and Biotest’s plasma business, the arrangement with respect to which will be documented in a transition services agreement to be mutually agreed by the parties between the signing of the Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Proposed Acquisition.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, (i) upon the closing, Buyer has agreed to assume certain liabilities of Seller related to the Business, including, without limitation, related to (x) product liabilities, breach of warranty, product complaints, product returns, post-market commitments, recalls, adverse event reporting, product deviation reporting, lookbacks, market withdrawals and field corrections or similar claims for injury to person or property with respect to the Business or any product of the Business to the extent such liabilities relate to products manufactured and sold by Buyer after the closing (other than inventory transferred to us at the closing, which will be allocated 50% to Buyer and 50% to Seller if not traceable to acts or omissions of a particular party); and (y) other regulatory matters, whether related to the pre-closing or post-closing period and including any liabilities related to the products of the Business, the FDA warning letter (the warning letter issued by the FDA to Seller in connection with outstanding issues requiring remediation at the manufacturing facility in Boca Raton, Florida), noncompliance with applicable laws and legal proceedings related to the foregoing, but excluding such liabilities that arise out of any fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation by Seller prior to the closing (the “Assumed Liabilities”); (ii) upon the closing, we have agreed to deliver to Seller an aggregate equity interest in us equal to 50%, less one share, of our issued and outstanding capital stock (calculated as of immediately following the closing and on a post-closing issuance basis) (the “Biotest Equity Interest”), consisting of (x) common stock representing 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock, equal to 4,295,580 common shares and (y) non-voting common stock equal to 8,591,160 shares of our common stock representing the balance of the Biotest Equity Interest which is convertible into our common stock upon the occurrence of certain specified events; (iii) upon the closing, we agreed to issue to Seller warrants, if any, necessary to acquire additional shares of our capital stock equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the number of shares represented by rights, options and warrants issued by us between September 12, 2016 until the closing, over (y) 184,000 shares; and (iv) on January 1, 2019, pursuant to the terms of a separate purchase agreement to be entered into by the parties at the closing, we have agreed to sell, transfer and convey to Seller for no additional consideration, all of our right, title and interest in and to our certain biocenter located in Norcross, Georgia and our certain biocenter located in Marietta, Georgia, which are subject to a repurchase right in favor of us if within five years after January 1, 2019, the Biotest stockholders and its related entities own less than 20% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. As part of the consideration, upon the closing, Seller will also be granted the right to designate one director and one observer to our board of directors, and under certain circumstances, Seller will be granted the right to designate an additional director.

Additionally, on the closing date, Seller has agreed to (i) deliver to us a capital contribution of $12.5 million in respect of the Biotest Equity Interest, which capital contribution will be contributed by Seller to Buyer; and (ii) fund a $15.0 million unsecured subordinated loan to us, which (a) will bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears, (b) has a term of five years and (c) will not be subject to any prepayment penalty or other breakage costs. Such loan will be subordinated to our existing indebtedness as of the signing of the Purchase Agreement and any additional indebtedness approved by our board of directors which is secured only by a mortgage on the owned real property acquired in connection with the transaction. Such loan will rank pari passu with all additional indebtedness approved by our board of directors that is not secured only by a mortgage on such owned real property and if such additional indebtedness is secured, the loan from Seller will be secured on a pari passu basis with such additional indebtedness. At any time after the closing, if we undertake an underwritten equity financing or a Private Investment in Public Equity, or PIPE, offering involving at least one unrelated third party, Biotest and/or Seller have agreed to participate pro rata in accordance with the Biotest Equity Interest up to an aggregate amount equal to $12.5 million.
 
Upon the closing, the parties will also enter into a ten-year plasma supply agreement, pursuant to which (x) Seller will sell to us high titer Hepatitis B plasma at a specified price (indexed by inflation), and (y) we will purchase from Seller all Hepatitis B plasma necessary to produce Nabi-HB® unless we require more than a specified amount, in which case we may use alternative sources for the excess quantity. Additionally, the parties have agreed to a mutual release with respect to any claims relating to or arising from any breach or default under the existing Manufacturing Supply and License Agreement and Master Services Agreement between Buyer and Seller. The mutual release is effective as of the signing of the Purchase Agreement conditioned on the closing of the Proposed Acquisition at which time the Manufacturing Supply and License Agreement and Master Services Agreement will terminate and the mutual release will no longer be conditional.
 
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties, including, without limitation, with respect to: organization; power and authority; due authorization; enforceability; capitalization; no conflict; no consents required; no actions; no orders; financial statements; indebtedness; no undisclosed liabilities; absence of certain changes; taxes; contracts; customers and suppliers; intellectual property; title to properties; real property; employee benefit plans; employees; insurance; compliance with laws; environmental; material permits; inventory; affiliate transactions; and no brokers.
 
The Purchase Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including covenants and agreements of: Seller to conduct the Business in the ordinary course until the Proposed Acquisition is completed or terminated and to not take certain actions relating to the Business during the interim period between signing and closing, without our prior consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; our conduct of our business in the ordinary course until the Proposed Acquisition is completed or terminated and to not take certain actions relating to its business during the interim period between signing and closing, without Seller’s prior consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; Seller not to compete with us in certain lines of business for a period of five years following the closing date; Seller and the Biotest Guarantors not to solicit our employees for one year following the closing date; we and Buyer not to solicit Seller’s employees for one year following the closing date; and Seller not to interfere with the our customers for five years following the closing date.

Subject to certain limitations, Buyer or Seller may terminate the Purchase Agreement if the Proposed Acquisition has not been consummated by September 30, 2017. A termination of the Purchase Agreement under certain customary circumstances relating to (i) our board of directors exercising their fiduciary out will entitle Seller to receive from us a termination fee in an amount equal to $2.5 million; or (ii) our failure to obtain the requisite stockholder approval will entitle Seller to receive expense reimbursement in an amount up to $2.5 million. In no event will Seller be entitled to both a termination fee and expense reimbursement.
 
We and Seller will each indemnify the other party after the closing for any losses arising from breaches of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, Buyer will indemnify Seller after the closing for any assumed liability, and Seller will indemnify us after the closing for any excluded asset or excluded liability. The representations, warranties and pre-closing covenants generally survive for 15 months following the closing of the transaction and each party’s indemnification obligations with respect to (a) its representations and warranties (other than its fundamental representations, which include representations related to taxes, organization, due authorization, organizational documents, no conflicts, enforceability, title, sufficiency, the Amended and Restated Product Distribution Agreement, effective as of January 19, 2016, by and between Seller and Kedrion Biopharma Inc., or the Kedrion Contract, brokers, etc. and ownership of our securities) are subject to a $25,000 mini-basket and $750,000 true deductible; and (b) its representations and warranties (other than fundamental) and pre-closing covenants are subject to a $25.0 million cap.
 
Seller will be entering into a standstill with ADMA, which will limit Seller’s ability to control the Company. Seller will also agree to a six (6) month lock-up of the sale of ADMA securities.
 
The consummation of the Proposed Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval of the Proposed Acquisition by the stockholders of ADMA and approval of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company by the stockholders of ADMA. The Proposed Acquisition is not subject to any financing conditions. There can be no assurance as to when the closing conditions will be satisfied, if at all.
 
Upon consummation and closing of the Proposed Acquisition, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to offer a fully vertically integrated plasma products and immune globulin platform in the U.S.
 
The Plasma Industry
 
Primary Immunodeficiency Disease 
 
PIDD is a class of hereditary disorders characterized by defects in the immune system, due to either a lack of necessary antibodies or a failure of these antibodies to function properly.  According to the World Health Organization, there are over 150 different presentations of PIDD.  As patients suffering from PIDD lack a properly functioning immune system, they typically receive monthly, outpatient infusions of IVIG therapy.  Without this exogenous antibody immune support, these patients would be susceptible to a wide variety of infectious diseases.  PIDD has an estimated prevalence of 1:1,200 in the U.S., or approximately 250,000 people.  Of these 250,000 people diagnosed with PIDD in the U.S., approximately 125,000 receive monthly infusions of IVIG and it is estimated that over 300,000 patients worldwide receive monthly IVIG infusions for PIDD.
 
As most patients with PIDD present with infections, the differential diagnosis and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by the clinical presentation.  In subjects with PIDD, individual infections are not necessarily more severe than those that occur in a normal host.  Rather, the clinical features suggestive of an immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature of infections with common pathogens that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis.  In addition, subjects with PIDD will often respond poorly to standard antimicrobial therapy or they may have repeated infections with the same pathogen.  The virulence of the infecting organism should also be considered, and a subject’s immune competence should be questioned when invasive infections are caused by low virulence or opportunistic pathogens.  For example, infection with the opportunistic pathogens Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously Pneumocystis carinii) or atypical mycobacteria should prompt an investigation for underlying immunodeficiency. Typical clinical presentations for subjects with PIDD are:
 
9




· | Antibody deficiency and recurrent bacterial infections;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | T-lymphocyte deficiency and opportunistic infections;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Other lymphocyte defects causing opportunistic infections;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Neutrophil defects causing immunodeficiency; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Complement deficiencies.
--+-------------------------

 
PIDD can present at any age from birth to adulthood, posing a considerable challenge for the practicing physician to know when and how to evaluate a subject for a possible immune defect. Subjects with marked antibody deficiencies are generally dependent on IVIG therapy for survival.  Benefits of adequate IVIG therapy in subjects not able to produce antibodies normally include a reduction of the severity and frequency of infections, prevention of chronic lung disease and prevention of enteroviral meningoencephalitis.  Several immune globulin products have already been approved by the FDA.
 
RI-002, our IVIG product candidate, contains polyclonal antibodies against various infectious agents (e.g., streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza type B, CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.) including standardized antibodies against RSV. RSV is a common respiratory virus that often presents during the winter months.  Nearly all children will have been infected with RSV by three years of age; however, the immune systems of most healthy children prevent significant morbidity and mortality.  Conversely, in patients who are immune-compromised, such as those with PIDD or who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant and may be on immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy, RSV infection can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Immune-compromised patients historically have a 5% to 15% rate of RSV infection, and, if left untreated, lower respiratory tract RSV infections in immune-compromised patients can result in a mortality rate of up to 40% of infected patients.  In hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, patients, a subset of the immune-compromised patient population with approximately 25,000 transplants being performed annually in the U.S., it is estimated that about 25% of patients treated with the current standard of care (aerosolized Ribavirin) will progress to lower respiratory tract infection, or LRTI, while 41% of patients untreated with the current standard of care will progress to LRTI.
 
Plasma - Background, Composition and Manufacturing
 
Human blood contains a number of components including:
 

· | Red blood cells – Used to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | White blood cells – Used by the immune system to fight infection;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Platelets – Used for blood clotting; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Plasma – Used to carry the aforementioned components throughout the body and provide support in clotting and immunity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Plasma is the most abundant blood component, representing approximately 55% of total blood volume.  Plasma, which is 90% water, is rich in proteins used by the human body for blood clotting and fighting infection.  These proteins account for approximately 7% of plasma’s volume.  As plasma contains these valuable proteins, plasma collection and the manufacturing of human plasma-derived therapeutics provide therapeutic benefits for ill patients.
 
In order to produce plasma-derived therapeutics that can be administered to ill patients, raw material plasma must be collected from human donors and then manufactured into specialized products.  Plasma is collected from healthy donors at FDA-licensed plasma donation centers.  To ensure safety of the collected plasma, all plasma donations are tested using FDA-approved methods of Nucleic Acid Testing, or NAT, for various infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and hepatitis C virus, or HCV.

Plasma is collected using a process called “plasmapheresis.” During plasmapheresis, a donor’s blood is drawn into a specialized medical device that separates the plasma component through centrifugation, and then returns the other blood components back into the donor’s bloodstream.  Plasmapheresis is performed utilizing an FDA-approved, automated device with a sterile, self-contained collection kit.  The plasma that is collected is known as “normal source plasma.” There are over 500 plasma donation centers in the U.S. As noted in a variety of plasma industry trade reports and related conferences, approximately 35 million liters of source plasma were collected in the U.S. in 2015.  In the U.S., a donor may donate plasma a maximum of two times during any seven-day period, with at least two days in between donations.  Plasma donation centers in the U.S. typically pay donors $25 to $50 per donation and some donors with rare or high antibody levels can be paid more.
 
In order to isolate the desired therapeutic elements in normal source plasma, it must initially undergo a manufacturing process called “fractionation.”  The process of fractionation was invented in the 1940’s by E.J. Cohn and is referred to as the Cohn method or cold ethanol fractionation.  First, the source plasma undergoes a process called pooling, in which the individual plasma donations are combined into a pooling tank.  Second, the Cohn fractionation method, which is a combination of time, temperature, pH, alcohol concentration, and centrifugation, is used to separate the desired plasma protein components, or “fractions.” After fractionation, the separated proteins are then re-suspended and are treated with a solvent detergent treatment process for viral inactivation.  Next, other forms of filtration (e.g., nanofiltration) are performed as an additional viral removal and viral reduction step.  Finally, with the various components separated and purified, the bulk product is formulated and filled into final, finished vials.  During these various steps of manufacturing, each lot is reviewed and tested for potency and purity prior to being approved for release.
 
The proteins in human plasma fall into four categories: albumin (60% of protein volume), immune globulins (15% of protein volume), coagulation factors (1% of protein volume), and other proteins (24% of protein volume) such as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, C1 esterase inhibitor, fibrin sealants and fibrinogen.  Many of the other proteins in plasma have yet to be developed into commercial therapies.  In the U.S., not only are the plasma collection centers subject to FDA licensure, but each plasma protein product that is derived and fractionated from plasma must undergo an approval process with FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER.  
 
Immune Globulins
 
In June 2008, the FDA published the FDA Guidance for Industry outlining the regulatory pathway for the approval of IVIG, for the treatment of PIDD (Guidance for Industry: Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Studies to Support Marketing of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) as Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency).
 
Immune globulins can be administered in three ways: intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously.  IVIG principally contains antibodies and, as such, provides passive immunization for individuals who are immune-deficient or who have been exposed to various infectious agents.  IVIG is used therapeutically in a variety of immunological diseases/deficiencies, such as PIDD, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease, bone marrow transplant, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.  We are aware that other companies are also evaluating IVIG in a clinical study for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, IVIG is also used as therapy in a variety of other diseases that do not involve primary or secondary immune deficiencies, such as multiple sclerosis, skin disease, and asthma.  These latter uses are referred to as “off-label” or evidence-based uses because the FDA has not approved their use in these indications and promotion of such uses is not permitted by FDA unless a BLA or BLA supplement with additional data is approved.  Among the various IVIG products, there are only 14 labeled indications approved by the FDA.  However, medical literature identifies at least 150 evidence based uses for IVIG, of which approximately 60 are currently included on lists of reimbursable uses by Medicare and other healthcare plans.  This provides opportunities for new product development and submissions.
 
11



There are two types of immune globulins, standard and hyperimmune.  The difference between standard immune globulins and hyperimmune globulins is that the latter are manufactured using plasma obtained from donors who have elevated amounts (high-titers) of specific antibodies.  These high-titer products can be used to treat and prevent diseases that present those specific antigens that are reactive with the high-titer antibodies.  Hyperimmune products currently available include hepatitis B, tetanus, rabies cytomegalovirus and RhoD immune globulins.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, the worldwide market for plasma-derived therapeutic drug products was approximately $15 billion and the U.S. market for all plasma-derived products was approximately $7.8 billion.  IVIG products accounted for approximately $4.8 billion of sales in the U.S. in 2014.  IVIG products are used to treat primary immune deficiencies, certain autoimmune diseases, and other illnesses for immune-compromised patients and certain neuropathy indications.  New research and data, additional labeled indications, an aging population and emerging countries with new markets are all adding to the worldwide growth of IVIG utilization.
 
Our Lead Product Candidate – RI-002
 
We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product.
 
In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review a BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved.
 
We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses.
 
Evaluation of PIDD Patients
 
PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014.
 
The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion.
 
12



RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI, reported. RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of ≤ 1 SBI per patient-year.  
 
On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins.
 
Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients
 
RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients.
 
We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002’s predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial.
 
From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
In order to produce plasma-derived therapeutics that can be administered to patients, raw material plasma is collected from healthy donors at plasma collection facilities licensed by the FDA.  ADMA BioCenters operates two FDA-licensed, GHA and MFDS-certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia, which facilities provide us with a portion of our plasma requirements.  By using our patented proprietary assay, we can identify plasma donors with elevated amounts of RSV antibodies and formulate RI-002 with an appropriate RSV titer level to ensure the final product is standardized to contain high levels of RSV antibodies.  Once source plasma has been collected, it is then fractionated and purified into specialized therapies, which are used by patients who require them.  We have agreements with independent third parties for the sourcing of blood plasma and for the fractionation and purification stages of manufacturing.  The contracts are with well-regarded facilities that are fully licensed to manufacture biologics.  We are dependent upon our third party suppliers for the manufacture of RI-002.  Our principal supplier of source plasma is BPC.

In December 2012, we entered into our Manufacturing, Supply and License Agreement with BPC.  Under the agreement, we agreed to purchase exclusively from BPC our worldwide requirements of RSV immune globulin manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies.  The term of the agreement is for a period of ten years from January 1, 2013, renewable for two additional five year periods at the agreement of both parties. We are obligated under this agreement to purchase a minimum of at least one lot of product during each calendar year after the finished product is approved by the FDA.  This number is subject to increase at our option.  As consideration for BPC’s obligations under the agreement, we are obligated to pay a dollar amount per lot of RSV immune globulin manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies, as well as a percentage royalty on the sales thereof and of RI-002, up to a specified cumulative maximum amount.  The agreement may be terminated by either party (a) by reason of a material breach if the breaching party fails to remedy the breach within 120 days after receiving notice of the breach from the other party, (b) upon bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or winding up of the other party, or (c) if the other party is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement for 120 consecutive days or more as a result of (a) or (b) above. Additionally, the parties have agreed to a mutual release with respect to any claims relating to or arising from any breach or default under the existing Manufacturing Supply and License Agreement and Master Services Agreement between us and BPC. The mutual release is effective as of January 21, 2017 conditioned on the closing of the Proposed Acquisition anticipated during the first half of 2017 at which time the Manufacturing Supply and License Agreement and Master Services Agreement will terminate and the mutual release will no longer be conditional.
 
Pursuant to the terms of a Plasma Purchase Agreement with BPC, we have agreed to purchase from BPC an annual minimum volume of source plasma containing antibodies to RSV to be used in the manufacture of RI-002.  This volume will increase at the earlier of our receipt of a BLA from the FDA, or March 31, 2016.  We must purchase a to-be-determined and agreed upon annual minimum volume from BPC, but may also collect high-titer RSV plasma from up to five wholly-owned ADMA BioCenters.  During 2015, BPC and ADMA amended its plasma supply agreement to allow ADMA the ability to collect its raw material RSV high-titer plasma from other third party collection organizations, thus allowing ADMA to expand its reach for raw material supply as we approach commercialization for RI-002. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires in November 2021, after which it may be renewed for two additional five-year periods if agreed to by the parties.  Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party fails to remedy any material default in the performance of any material condition or obligation under the agreement following notice.  Either party may also terminate the agreement, after providing written notice, if a proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement of debts, insolvency or receivership law is filed by or against the other party, and is not dismissed or stayed, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, or the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or becomes insolvent.  We may also terminate the agreement upon written notice if the clinical development of our product candidate is halted or terminated, whether by the FDA, a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or any other regulatory authority.  Upon termination of the agreement, we must pay for any source plasma already delivered to us and for any source plasma collected under the terms of the agreement. As part of the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, we will amend the Plasma Purchase Agreement to extend BPC’s annual minimum purchase requirements of plasma containing antibodies to RSV for ten years through the closing date of the Proposed Acquisition, which is anticipated during the first half of 2017.
 
On June 22, 2012, we entered into a Plasma Supply Agreement with BPC for the purchase of normal source plasma from our ADMA BioCenters, Norcross, Georgia facility to be used in BPC's proprietary products’ manufacturing, which was subsequently amended on February 25, 2014 and then amended and restated on March 23, 2016.  After the initial term, the agreement may be renewed on an annual basis upon the mutual consent of the parties.  In addition to any other remedy it may have, either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to remedy any material default in the performance of a material condition or obligation under the agreement following written notice.  In addition, upon giving the appropriate written notice, either party may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following events: a proceeding under bankruptcy, reorganization, agreement of debts, insolvency or receivership law is filed by or against the other party, and is not dismissed or stayed, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, or the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or becomes insolvent.  Neither party can assign the agreement or any of its right or obligations there under without the express written consent of the other party.  However, with notice to the other party, either party without the other party’s consent may assign the agreement to (i) its affiliate, or (ii) a successor to all or substantially all of the assets relating to the business of that party which is involved in the fulfillment of its obligations under the agreement.  Under the agreement, BPC applied to the GHA for, and we have subsequently obtained, GHA certification. The Manufacturing, Supply and License Agreement with BPC will be terminated upon the closing the Proposed Acquisition anticipated during the first half of 2017.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, two of our customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd., or SK, and BPC, represented greater than 95% of our total revenues, with SK representing approximately 14% of our total revenues and BPC representing approximately 82% of our total revenues. We believe SK will represent approximately less than 10% of our total revenues for 2017.
 
On June 7, 2012, we entered into a Testing Services Agreement with Quest Diagnostics Clinical Laboratories, Inc., or Quest, in which Quest agreed to provide biomarker testing and related support services for protocol screening and recertification which are exclusive to us.  If either party believes the other party is in material breach of any of their obligations under the agreement, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement by providing the breaching party with written notice specifying the material breach(es) and indicating clearly its intention to terminate the agreement.  If the breaching party cures such breach, the non-breaching party’s notice is void.  In addition, either party can terminate the agreement without cause upon written notice.  All data, test results, studies and other information generated by Quest in performing services under the agreement will be our sole property.  Neither party can assign the agreement or any of its right or obligations under the agreement without the express written consent of the other party, except under specified circumstances.  Quest agreed and acknowledged that we paid for the development and validation of the testing assay and as such, the assay is our sole property and shall only be utilized for our benefit.
 
Marketing, Sales and Market Research
 
We intend to market and sell our product through a small specialty sales force, distribution relationships and other customary industry methods.  We will focus our efforts specifically on the easily identifiable treatment centers which specialize in the care and management of immune compromised individuals.  We estimate that there are approximately 500 leading specialty programs in the U.S. which have significant patient populations for PIDD, suitable for treatment with RI-002.  We plan to hire our own specialty sales force which will consist of account managers, medical science liaisons and other normal and customary scientific, medical and detail representatives.  Our management and board of directors has substantial prior direct marketing, sales and distribution experience with plasma derived drugs, specialty immune globulins and other biological products.  We anticipate staffing the company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, supply chain and logistics, human resources, financial and other operational management positions.  As is normal and customary in the plasma products industry, we may also use a network of national distribution organizations that have specialty divisions that focus on plasma products to fulfill orders for RI-002. We anticipate that due to certain recent events, including our Proposed Acquisition, our current and anticipated plans and intentions will evolve and change. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K and the section entitled “Item 1A – Risk Factors” beginning on page 21 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
In our Manufacturing, Supply and License Agreement, we granted BPC an exclusive license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, collectively referred to as the Territory, to have access to our testing services for testing of BPC’s plasma samples using our proprietary RSV assay, and to reference (but not access) our proprietary information for the purpose of BPC seeking regulatory approval for the RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in the Territory.  As consideration for the license, BPC agreed to provide us with certain services at no charge and also compensate us with cash payments upon the completion of certain milestones.  BPC is also obligated to pay us an adjustable royalty based on a percentage of revenues from the sale of RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in the Territory for 20 years from the date of first commercial sale. Additionally, BPC has agreed to grant us an exclusive license for marketing and sales in the U.S. and Canada for BPC’s Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin, or VZIG, of which terms are expected to be terminated upon the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated during the first of 2017. The mutual release is effective as of January 21, 2017 conditioned on the closing of the Proposed Acquisition anticipated during the first half of 2017 at which time the Manufacturing Supply and License Agreement and Master Services Agreement will terminate and the mutual release will no longer be conditional.

Competition
 
Although blood plasma and its derivative proteins are not subject to patent protection, the FDA recognizes each immune globulin product as unique and generally requires a separate Investigational New Drug, or IND, clinical trial and BLA for each as a condition to approval.  Regardless of whether competitors are able to develop an assay that can achieve our level of consistency and reproducibility in providing RSV antibody titer data, we believe they would still be required to validate and qualify such an assay as well as conduct clinical trials and undergo an FDA review prior to marketing an immune globulin product.  The plasma products industry is highly competitive.  We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from both U.S.-based and foreign producers of plasma products, some of which have lower cost structures, greater access to capital, direct ownership of manufacturing facilities, greater resources for research and development, and sophisticated marketing capabilities.
 
These competitors may include: CSL Behring, Grifols Biologicals, Shire, Octapharma and Kedrion.  In addition to competition from other large worldwide plasma products providers, we face competition in local areas from smaller entities.  In Europe, where the industry is highly regulated and health care systems vary from country to country, local companies may have greater knowledge of local health care systems, more established infrastructures and have existing regulatory approvals or a better understanding of the local regulatory process, allowing them to market their products more quickly.  Moreover, plasma therapy generally faces competition from non-plasma products and other courses of treatments.  For example, recombinant Factor VIII products compete with plasma-derived products in the treatment of Hemophilia A.
 
Intellectual Property
 
During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled ‘Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,’ which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015 our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002’s antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price.
 
We also rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so.  We also seek to enhance and ensure our competitive position through a variety of means including our unique and proprietary plasma donor selection criteria, our proprietary formulation methodology for plasma pooling, and the proprietary reagents, controls, testing standards, standard operating procedures and methods we use in our anti-RSV microneutralization assay.  While we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property, litigation can be costly and there can be no assurance that our patent will be enforced or that our trade secret policies and practices or other agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property.  We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.  These processes, systems, and/or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies as a result of any such breaches.  Third parties may also own or could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and there can be no assurance that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all.
 
In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.  We also seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors.  Although we rely, in part, on confidentiality, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties with access to our proprietary information to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and other proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that these agreements or any other security measures relating to such trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and proprietary rights will be adequate, will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.  To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.  We have filed for other provisional patent applications with the U.S. which are pending relating to expanded hyperimmune globulin products.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the testing (preclinical and clinical), manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of products and product candidates.  If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted.  We and our manufacturers may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws.
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Our current and anticipated future product candidates are considered “biologics” under the FDA regulatory framework. FDA's regulatory authority for the approval of biologics resides in the PHS Act. However, biologics are also subject to regulation under the FDCA because most biological products also meet the FDCA’s definition of "drugs." Most pharmaceuticals or “conventional drugs” consist of pure chemical substances and their structures are known. Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination. This requires sterile processes to be applied from initial manufacturing steps.  The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following (although the FDA is given wide discretion to impose different or more stringent requirements on a case-by-case basis):

1. | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations and other regulations; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 


3. | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials meeting FDA requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | manufacturing (through an FDA-licensed contract manufacturing organization) of product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to be used in the clinical trials and providing manufacturing information need in regulatory filings;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | submission of a BLA to the FDA;
---+--------------------------------


6. | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced, and potentially other involved facilities as well, to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable regulations; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | the FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.  See the section entitled “Item 1A – Risk Factors” beginning on page 21 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
We submit manufacturing and analytical data, among other information, to the FDA as part of an IND application.  Subject to certain exceptions, an IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, issues a clinical hold to delay a proposed clinical investigation due to concerns or questions about the product or the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.  Our submission of an IND, or those of our collaboration partners, may not result in the FDA allowance to commence a clinical trial.  A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.  The FDA must also approve certain changes to an existing IND, such as certain manufacturing changes.  Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, duly constituted to meet FDA requirements, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the safety of the study and study subjects until completed.  The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and regulations for informed consent.

Clinical Trials
 
For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, which may overlap (although additional or different trials may be required by the FDA as well):

1. | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Certain Phase III clinical trials are referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to provide substantial evidence of reproducibility of clinical efficacy results and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), a BLA application or supplement for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. In 2012, the FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit such an application submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP.
 
In some cases, the FDA may condition continued approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials, or other commitments.  Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase IV studies.
 
Biological License Application
 
The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling, and the payment of a user fee, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA.  The FDA reviews all BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may reject the filing as inadequate to merit review or may request additional information to be submitted in a very short time frame before accepting a BLA for filing.  Once a BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application.
 
During its review of a BLA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of experts for their review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, which information is taken into consideration along with FDA’s own review findings.  The FDA may refuse to approve a BLA and issue a CRL if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.  In a CRL, it may also require additional clinical or other data, including one or more additional pivotal Phase III clinical trials.  Even if such requested data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial of the BLA.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do.  If the FDA’s evaluations of the BLA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a CRL, which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA.  If a CRL is issued, a company has up to twelve months to resubmit or withdraw the BLA, unless the FDA allows for an extension. If a CRL is issued, if and when those items have been resolved to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the product for certain indications.  The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.  In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.  Products may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indications and in accordance with the FDA-approved label. The FDA generally does not allow drugs to be promoted for “off-label” uses – that is, uses that are not described in the product’s approved labeling and that differ from those that were approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the FDA generally limits approved uses to those studied in clinical trials. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, other labeling changes, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and/or require additional manufacturing data.

Satisfaction of the FDA regulations and approval requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.  Typically, if a product candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with RI-002, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.  The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for changes in dose form or new indications for a product candidate on a timely basis, or at all.  Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages.  Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.  Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates would harm our business.  In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 
Upon the resubmission of a BLA application, the FDA will classify the resubmission as Class 1 (triggering a 2-month review goal for the FDA) or Class 2 (triggering a 6-month review goal for the FDA). 
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Biological drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. For biologics products in particular, for each product lot the applicant must submit materials relating to that lot to the FDA before the lot can be released for distribution.
 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, sales or use, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible fines and other penalties.  We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements.  If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product.
 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet.  A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning and/or other regulatory letters, corrective advertising and potential major fines and other penalties.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription drug products (including biological drug products) is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Regulation of ADMA BioCenters 
 
All blood and blood product collection and manufacturing centers which engage in interstate commerce must be licensed by the FDA.  In order to achieve licensure, the organization must submit a BLA and undergo pre-licensure inspection.  Our ADMA BioCenters, located in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia, have completed these requirements and hold FDA licenses along with GHA and MFDS certifications.  In order to maintain the license, the facilities operated by ADMA BioCenters will be inspected at least every two years.  ADMA BioCenters is also required to submit annual reports to the FDA.
 
Blood plasma collection and manufacturing centers are also subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, state licensure, and compliance with industry standards such as the International Quality Plasma Program, or IQPP. Compliance with state and industry standards is verified by means of routine inspection. We believe that both of our ADMA BioCenters facilities are currently in compliance with state and industry standards.  Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any facilities operated by ADMA BioCenters would harm our business.  In addition, we cannot predict what adverse federal and state regulations and industry standards may arise in the future.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., if we choose to pursue clinical development and commercialization in the European Union, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future product.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.  The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.  The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure.  The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.  The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.  Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.  Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval, refuse it or request additional information.
 
Product Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Research and Development
 
ADMA’s expenditures on research and development were approximately $7.7 million and $7.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Employees
 
ADMA Biologics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters, Inc., has a total of 92 employees, which include 5 part-time employees, as well as additional full and part-time consultants and temporary staff.   Over the course of the next year, we anticipate hiring additional full-time employees devoted to sales and marketing, medical and scientific affairs, general and administrative, as well as hiring additional staff to the plasma collection centers as appropriate.  We intend to use Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, third parties and consultants to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing, regulatory affairs and quality control services in addition to corporate marketing, branding and commercialization activities.
Corporate Information 
 
ADMA Biologics, Inc. was founded on June 24, 2004 as a New Jersey corporation and re-incorporated in Delaware on July 16, 2007 (“Former ADMA”). On February 13, 2012, Former ADMA merged into a subsidiary of R&R Acquisition VI, Inc., a Delaware “blank check” company, which had been incorporated in 2006 and which subsequently changed its name to ADMA Biologics, Inc. upon completion of the merger.  For accounting purposes, the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with Former ADMA as the accounting acquiror (legal acquiree) and R&R Acquisition VI, Inc. (now ADMA Biologics, Inc.) as the accounting acquiree (legal acquiror), effectively a recapitalization of Former ADMA.
