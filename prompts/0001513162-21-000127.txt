   ITEM 1. BUSINESS
   BUSINESS OVERVIEW
   THE COMPANY
   Biomerica, Inc. ("Biomerica", the "Company", "we", “us” or "our") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1971 as Nuclear Medical Systems, Inc., and later changed its name to Biomerica, Inc. The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Biomerica de Mexico, which is used for assembly/manufacturing, and BioEurope GmbH, which acts as a distributor of Biomerica products in certain markets. 
   We are a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point-of-care (in home and in physicians' offices) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical conditions and diseases. Our products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs. 
   Our primary focus is the research and development of revolutionary, patented, diagnostic-guided therapy (“DGT”) products to treat gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”), and other inflammatory diseases. These products are directed at chronic inflammatory illnesses that are widespread and common, and as such address very large markets. If these DGT products prove effective in their clinical trials, and are ultimately cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), we believe the revenues potential to the Company is significant. 
  We are currently finalizing an endpoint determination clinical study on its InFoods® IBS product. This trial is being conducted at Mayo Clinics in Florida and Arizona, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc., a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston Methodist, University of Michigan and other institutions. We expect final patient enrollment in September 2021, and the trial completed by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2022, with trial results reported shortly thereafter. During fiscal 2022, we also expect to be entertaining partnership/licensing discussions with pharmaceutical and technology companies that could help us commercialize the product, including obtaining FDA clearance. In order to file for final FDA clearance, we will need to conduct a pivotal trial that will be substantially similar to the endpoint trial that is currently nearing completion. The pivotal trial will focus on treating the specific endpoint(s) in IBS patients that show positive improvement under the current endpoint trial. We expect this final pivotal trial to be run at the same institutions that performed the endpoint trial, plus additional large gastrointestinal (GI) medical groups. If the endpoint trial shows positive results in IBS patients, we will also have the option to immediately seek regulatory clearance for the product to be sold outside of the US. 
   Our medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide primarily in two markets: 1) clinical laboratories and 2) point-of-care (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drugstores). The diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, or fecal specimens from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases and other medical complications by measuring or detecting the existence and/or level of specific bacteria, hormones, antibodies, antigens or other substances, which may exist in a patient’s body, within stools, or blood, often in extremely small concentrations.
  Due to the global 2019 SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, in March 2020 we began redirecting and focusing a majority of our resources to develop, test, validate, seek regulatory approval for, and sell diagnostic products that indicate if a person has been infected by COVID-19. During fiscal 2021, we sold two primary types of Covid 19 tests; 1) antibody diagnostic tests that use a patient’s blood sample to detect if the patient has certain antibodies to COVID-19 that were created as part of their body’s immune response to a COVID-19 infection, even if the infection was asymptomatic, and 2) COVID-19 antigen tests that use a patient’s nasal fluid sample to detect if a patient is currently infected with the virus.  During the year, we sold these products outside of the U.S. under a CE Mark (European Conformity). Because individual orders for these tests have been large in size, this has created volatility and material fluctuations in our monthly and quarterly revenues. We continue to receive and fill orders for our COVID-19 test products. 
   Aside from the COVID-19 products we offer, the other products we sell are primarily focused on gastrointestinal diseases, food intolerances and certain esoteric tests. These diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology. Most of our products are CE marked and/or sold for diagnostic use where they are registered by each country’s regulatory agency.  In addition, some products are cleared for sale in the U.S. by the FDA.
   5
 
 While sales continue to occur in our COVID-19 products, by fiscal year end, the majority of our research and development efforts have returned to a focus on development and commercialization of non-Covid related products such as our Helicobacter pylori (“H. Pylori”) product, and our InFoods® IBS diagnostic guided therapy product and our EZ Detect colon disease home screening test. As such, we expect to file for 510K clearance with the FDA for its H. Pylori laboratory diagnostic test during our second fiscal quarter of 2022. If approved by the FDA, we intend to commence sales of this product in the U.S. We also intend to sell this product internationally including in the European Union (“EU”) under a CE Mark which we will seek once we file 510K application with the FDA. International sales could commence earlier than U.S. sales. 
   We recently added several new employees in its sales and marketing department in order to increase sales of existing non-Covid products during fiscal 2022.  Through these efforts, our EZ Detect colon disease home screening test is seeing a significant increased interest from retailers and distributors. 
   Technological advances in medical diagnostics have made it possible to perform diagnostic tests within the home and the physician's office (the point-of-care), rather than in the clinical laboratory. One of our objectives has also been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that are accurate, employ easily obtained specimens, and are simple to perform without instrumentation. Our over-the-counter (home use) and professional use (doctor’s office, clinics, etc.) rapid diagnostic products help to manage existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and prompt diagnosis. Typically, tests of this kind require the services of medical technologists and sophisticated instrumentation. Further, results are often not available until at least the following day. We believe that rapid point-of-care tests can be as accurate as laboratory tests when used properly, require limited to no instrumentation, give reliable results in minutes and can be performed with confidence in the home or the physician's office.
   Biomerica maintains its headquarters in Irvine, California, where it houses administration, product development, sales and marketing, customer services and its primary manufacturing operations. Biomerica also maintains manufacturing and assembly operations in Mexicali, Mexico, in order to reduce the cost of manufacturing and compete more effectively worldwide. We expend considerable funds in research and development of certain new products that diagnose and, in certain cases, are designed to be used as a therapy for several major medical diseases. These products are both internally developed and licensed from others. We employ experienced and highly trained technical personnel (including Ph.D.’s and scientists) to develop new products and evaluate and implement technology technical transfer activities. Our technical staff, many of whom have been previously employed at large diagnostic manufacturing companies, has extensive industry experience. We also rely on our Scientific Advisory Board of leading medical doctors and clinicians to assist in guiding our clinical studies and product development.   
   Additional information about Biomerica is available on our website at www.biomerica.com. The content on any website referred to in this Form 10-K/A is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K/A unless expressly noted. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, Current Reports on Forms 8-K, Proxy Statements and all other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practical after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC and are also available online at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
   PRODUCTION
   Most of our diagnostic test kits are manufactured and/or assembled at our facilities in Irvine, California and in Mexicali, Mexico. We established our manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico in fiscal 2003 and moved a significant portion of our diagnostic packaging and assembly to that facility. 
   Production of diagnostic tests can involve formulating component antibodies and antigens in specified concentrations, attaching a tracer to the antigen, filling components into vials, packaging and labeling. We continually engage in quality control procedures to assure the consistency and quality of our products and to comply with applicable FDA and international regulations. 
   Our manufacturing operations and facilities are regulated by the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices for medical devices. We have an internal quality department that monitors and evaluates product quality and output. We also have an internal Quality Systems department whose goal is to ensure that our operating procedures are in compliance with current FDA, CE Mark and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) regulations. We either produce our own antibodies and antigens or purchase these materials from qualified vendors. We have alternate, approved sources for most critical raw materials and are working to procure alternate sources for the few that we do not have. 
  6
 
  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
   During most of the fiscal year, we focused much of our Research and Development (“R&D”) resources on developing several COVID-19 diagnostic tests, as discussed in this section below, and pursuing the regulatory approval of two tests for the gastrointestinal market.  Our increase in research and development spending is due to our focus on these tests and outside clinical studies intended to demonstrate the feasibility of FDA clearance for such tests. We also utilize technical personnel, with Ph.D. and other degrees and extensive experience in development and production of health diagnostic tests, to conduct other development activities and improve existing products, as well as explore potential new technologies that we may wish to develop and commercialize. Research and development expenses include the costs of materials, supplies, personnel, consultants, legal fees, facilities, outside clinical trial sites and equipment as well as outside contract services. Consolidated research and development expenses incurred by Biomerica for the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 aggregated $2,471,453, and $1,932,570, respectively. As Biomerica moves forward with development, validation and commercialize of additional key products that address diseases with large market opportunities, research and development expenses are expected to increase during upcoming quarters. 
   We developed a unique diagnostic-guided therapy that is designed to allow physicians to identify patient-specific foods (e.g. pork, milk, onions, sugar, chickpeas, etc.), that when removed from the diet, may alleviate or improve an individual's symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). This product is called InFoods® IBS and is currently in clinical studies at the Mayo Clinics in Florida and Arizona, Houston Methodist, the University of Michigan and other institutions. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has issued the Company two patents with broad claims that protect the InFoods® IBS product. Patents have also been allowed or issued in the countries of Japan, Korea, Mexico and Singapore. Additional patents for this product have been filed in the U.S. and in other countries. We are also developing, and have filed patents for other diseases that utilize the InFoods® DGT technology platform which include:  Functional Dyspepsia, Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”), Migraine Headaches, and Osteoarthritis. Our first patent to be allowed for a disease/illness other than IBS was allowed in Japan in August, 2021. This patent covers the use of our InFoods® technology to diagnose and treat persons suffering from depression. We are planning to pursue a de novo 510(k) clearance with the FDA rather than a Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) for the InFoods® IBS product. De novo clearance is typically faster and less expensive than the PMA route, which is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA for this type of product.
   We are also in studies to evaluate the performance of our new and proprietary H. Pylori test.  The clinical studies were conducted at the University of Southern California (“USC”), a European University and several other U.S. locations. We are working to complete the analytical studies needed to prepare for submission to the FDA and plans to utilize a 510(k) clearance pathway for this test. Biomerica’s test is designed to provide highly accurate sensitivity and specificity for H. pylori testing and for monitoring of treatment. 
  During fiscal 2021, we dedicated much of our resources to develop, test, validate, seek regulatory approval for, and sell diagnostic products that indicate if a person has been infected by COVID-19. Our COVID-19 R&D efforts focused primarily on the following two types of tests: 1) antibody diagnostic tests that use a patient’s blood sample to detect if the patient has certain antibodies to COVID-19 that were created as part of their body’s immune response to a COVID-19 infection, even if the infection was asymptomatic, and 2) antigen tests that use a patient’s nasal fluid sample to detect if a patient is currently infected with the virus. These tests were sold, and continue to be sold by us, in various markets outside of the US. We currently do not intend to offer either of these tests in the US.
   During the fiscal year we also submitted to the FDA an application under and Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) to sell in the U.S. a lab-scale, high throughput ELISA COVID-19 antibody test kit that would be sold to labs and hospitals to perform COVID-19 antibody testing. After the EUA was submitted to the FDA, on two separate occasions the FDA assigned reviewers to this EUA who each requested additional information and interacted with us on this submission, as is customary. However, we have not yet been issued clearance for this product to be sold. It appears that the FDA began redirecting and focusing its resources on reviewing applications for products that pertain to patients who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus such as polymerase chain reaction tests and antigen tests, as the demand for antibody tests diminished in the second half of calendar year 2020.  
   Beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the focus of our R&D resources returned to non-COVID-19 products such as our H. Pylori product, our InFoods® IBS product and other products that we sell or would like to sell in the future.

 MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION
   Biomerica has approximately 400 current customers for its diagnostic business, of which approximately 75 are foreign distributors, 40 are domestic distributors and the balance are primarily domestic hospital and clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, chain drugstores, wholesalers, physicians' offices and e-commerce customers.
   We employ a director of sales and marketing for Europe and South America who is headquartered in Germany.  She has over 20 years of experience selling and marketing diagnostic and life science products across multiple diagnostics technologies and disciplines. She possesses broad international business experience, with communication skills in German, English, Spanish, French and Portuguese, and scientific and technical understanding of gastrointestinal diagnostic products. She also has strong relationships with key strategic entities in Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Canada and the U.S. who is and will continue to help Biomerica add new distributors for existing products, and add new product-lines for future distribution by us. 
   We rely on affiliated and unaffiliated distributors, advertising in medical and trade journals, exhibitions at trade shows, direct mailings and an internal sales staff to market our diagnostic products. We target two main markets: (a) clinical laboratories and (b) point-of-care testing (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drug stores). 
 
Due to the Coronavirus global pandemic, our operations have been negatively impacted. We have faced disruptions in certain of the following areas, and may face further challenges from supply chain disruptions, loss of contracts and/or customers, closure of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or of the facilities of our suppliers, partners and customers, travel, shipping and logistical disruptions, government responses of all types, international business risks in countries where we make and/or sell our products, loss of human capital or personnel at the Company, its partners and its customers, interruptions of production, customer credit risk, and general economic calamities. These ongoing pandemic related disruptions can materially negatively impact our operations and financial performance and may continue to have significant material negative impacts on us.   
   For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had two distributors and three distributors, respectively, which accounted for a total of 60% and 57% of our net consolidated sales, respectively. Of this, for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, the largest of the distributors mentioned above accounted for 33% and 26%, respectively, of net consolidated sales.  
  At May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had two distributors and three distributors, respectively, which accounted for a total of 73% and 80%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable. Of the 73% as of May 31, 2021, 41% was owed by a distributor in China. Total gross receivables at May 31, 2021 and 2020 were $2,292,466 and $1,836,852, respectively.
  BACKLOG
   At May 31, 2021 and 2020, Biomerica had a backlog of unshipped orders of approximately $85,000 and $727,000 respectively. At May 31, 2021, this consisted primarily of orders to our distributor in the Middle East.
   RAW MATERIALS
   The principal raw materials utilized by Biomerica consist of various chemicals, serums, reagents and packaging supplies. Almost all of our raw materials are available from several sources, and we are not dependent upon any single source of supply or a few suppliers. However, due to the limited number of suppliers of some materials, especially those such as antibodies, there is always the possibility that we may encounter difficulty in the future obtaining key raw materials for its manufacturing processes or that such materials may be exceedingly costly. For the year ended May 31, 2021, one vendor accounted for 58% of our purchases of raw materials. For the year ended May 31, 2020, one vendor accounted for 59% of our purchases of raw materials. 
   Our inventory consists of various types of materials including antibodies, antigens, bottles, boxes, various chemicals and reagents utilized in the manufacture of our test kits as well as products in various stages of completion.
  8
 
  Our sourcing and receiving of raw materials have been negatively impacted due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our suppliers have been impacted by plant shut-downs, state or national mandated or recommended shut-downs, restrictions and constraints on distribution channels including ship freight, air freight and trucking, among other things. These suppliers are also experiencing their own disruptions in sourcing raw materials.  It is unclear to what extent raw material availability will be impacted in the foreseeable future, and how that will impact our production and sales. 
   COMPETITION
   Immunodiagnostic products, including COVID-19 products are currently produced globally by hundreds of companies. Biomerica is not a significant player in the overall market for most of the product categories in which we compete. However, we do have certain proprietary products, such as our EZ Detect colon disease home test, that do not have significant competition from competitors with identical tests.  
   Our competitors vary greatly in size. Many are divisions or subsidiaries of well-established medical and pharmaceutical companies which are much larger than Biomerica and expend substantially greater amounts than we do for research and development, manufacturing, advertising and marketing.
   The primary competitive factors affecting the sale of diagnostic products are uniqueness, technology, quality of product, performance, price, service and marketing. We believe we compete primarily on the basis of the uniqueness of our products, the quality of our products, the speed of our test results, our patent position, our pricing and our prompt shipment of orders. We offer a broad range of products, but have had limited marketing capability. However, during the past 18 months, we have expanded our sales and marketing capability, through marketing and strategic cooperation with larger companies and distributors and by hiring several new employees with marketing and sales expertise. 
   GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC BUSINESS 
   Our primary business consists of selling products that are generally legally defined to be in vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical devices. As a result, we are considered to be an in vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical device manufacturer, and as such are subject to the regulations of numerous governmental entities. These agencies include the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), and Consumer Product Safety Commission as wells as European Government agencies. These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new in vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture and labeling of medical devices, the maintenance of certain records, the reporting of potential product problems, and other matters.
   The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the "FDCA") regulates medical devices in the United States by classifying them into one of three classes based on the extent of regulation believed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general controls, such as device listing, adequate labeling, and adherence to the Quality System Regulation ("QSR") as well as Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”), labeling and other regulatory requirements. Some Class I medical devices are exempt from the requirement of Pre-Market Notification or clearance. Class II devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries, as well as adherence to the general controls provisions applicable to Class I devices. Class III devices are devices that generally must receive clearance prior to marketing by the FDA pursuant to a pre-market approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, this classification can also apply to novel technology or new intended uses or applications for existing devices. Our products are primarily either Class I or Class II medical devices. 
  Pursuant to FDA requirements, we have registered our manufacturing facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer, and listed the medical devices we manufacture. We are also subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with FDA regulations. This includes the QSR, which requires that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to issues such as design controls, manufacturing, testing and validation activities. Further, we are required to comply with other FDA requirements with respect to labeling and MDR regulation which requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our products, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all relevant QSR and MDR requirements.
   9
 
 In addition, our facility is required to have a California Medical Device Manufacturing License. The license is not transferable and must be renewed biannually. Our current license is valid until November 19, 2022. 
   Through compliance with FDA and California regulations, we can market some of our medical devices throughout the United States. International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. In Europe, the directives of the European Union (“EU’) require that a device have a CE Mark in order to be sold in EU countries. Our Company complies with In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (“IVDD”) 98/79/EC and Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”). We also comply with ISO 13485 2016 Medical Devices Quality Management Systems - Requirements for Regulatory Purposes. 
   At present, outside the EU the regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We work with our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to ensure that we comply with the regulatory laws of those countries. We believe that our international sales to date have been in compliance with the laws of all foreign countries in which we have made sales. Exports of most medical devices are also subject to certain FDA regulatory controls.
   The designing, development, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of Biomerica’s immunoassay in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical device products are subject to regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the FDA and state agencies.  FDA regulations require that some new products have pre-marketing clearance or approval by the FDA and require these products to be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s “Current Good Manufacturing Practice” regulations, to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations.  After a product that is subject to FDA regulation is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including, for example, the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements, such as the FDA’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals.  The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and post -market surveillance. The last FDA announced inspection was in November 2019 and no observations were noted. We believe that all Biomerica products sold in the U.S. comply with the FDA and state regulations.
   Biomerica is an FDA regulated and ISO 13485:2016 certified In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices company. Our goal is to provide high quality medical diagnostic products that generally meet or exceed customer requirements and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements: FDA 21 CFR Part 820 Quality Management System, EN ISO 13485:2016, Medical Devices Quality Management Systems - Requirements for Regulatory Purposes, In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive  98/79/EC & and Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, Guidelines related to Medical Devices Directives and Guidance on CE Marking, etc.  Biomerica involve its employees in a continuous improvement process to increase productivity, improve quality and maintain the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of our quality management system. 
   The new EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) 2017/745 entered into force on May 25, 2017. The MDR transition period ends May 26, 2021 and will replace MDD 93/42/EEC. Manufacturers have less than one year to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new, more stringent regulatory requirements of the European Union. Our Notified Body became designated under MDR in July 2020. 
  The new EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) 2017/746 transition period ends May 26, 2022 and will replace IVDD 98/79/EC. Manufacturers have less than one year to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new, more stringent regulatory requirements of the European Union. Notified Bodies can begin certifying devices to the new IVDR requirements once they have been designated under IVDR by their Competent Authority. While we are working to update our technical documentation to comply with these new and more stringent IVDR requirements, it is unclear which of our product will meet these new requirements prior to the May 26, 2022 deadline. If we are unable to complete the new technical documentation requirement, or have our updated documentation files approved by our Notified Body, prior to May 26, 2022, we will potentially be unable to sell these products in markets that require compliance with these EU IVDR regulations. In addition, our current Notified Body, which represents the regulatory bodies in the EU, may themselves not be able to meet all of the new IVDR requirements and become designated under IVDR. If this happens, we may need to transfer to a new Notified Body that does meet the new IVDR requirements and has been designated, or we may need to delay selling products in these regions until our Notified Body becomes designated under IVDR regulations.

 SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
   The businesses of our Company and its subsidiaries have not been subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.
   INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
   The following table sets forth the dollar volume of revenue attributable to sales to domestic customers and foreign customers during the last two fiscal years for Biomerica:

 | Year Ended 
-----------------------------------------------+-------------
 | May 31, 2021 | | May 31, 2020
Revenues from sales to unaffiliated customers: | | | | | | 
Europe | $ | 4,301,000 | 60% | $ | 2,434,000 | 36% 
Asia | | 1,908,000 | 26% | | 1,867,000 | 28% 
United States | | 548,000 | 8% | | 445,000 | 7% 
South America | | 250,000 | 3% | | 1,615,000 | 24% 
Middle East | | 192,000 | 3% | | 314,000 | 5% 
Other | | - | 0% | | 18,000 | 0% 
Total | $ | 7,199,000 | 100% | $ | 6,693,000 | 100%

   We recognize that our foreign sales could be subject to some special or unusual risks, which are not present in the ordinary course of business in the United States. Changes in economic factors, government regulations, terrorism, tariffs, embargos, trade wars, import/export restrictions, disruptions in shipping and distribution channels and drop in demand for our products due to regional or national shut-downs from the COVID-19 pandemic, patients’ fear or refusal to visit hospitals and healthcare providers due to the pandemic where our products are sold and used, the erosion of economic conditions in those countries, and many other factors all could impact sales within certain foreign countries. In addition, these factors could also impact our ability to collect foreign accounts receivable. Foreign countries have licensing requirements applicable to the sale of diagnostic products, which vary substantially from domestic requirements; depending upon the product and the foreign country, these may be more or less restrictive than requirements within the United States and may change without notice. Foreign diagnostic sales at Biomerica are made primarily through a network of approximately 75 independent distributors in approximately 65 countries.
   The COVID-19 related factors mentioned above and in “Risk Factors” have also negatively impacted domestic sales of our non-COVID-19 products and may continue to negatively impact our domestic and international sales into the foreseeable future. 
   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
   We regard the protection of our methodologies, designs, product formulations, manufacturing processes, diagnostic procedures, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade secrets as important to our future success. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with most of our fulfillment partners and strategic partners to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. We cannot be certain that these contractual arrangements or the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patents or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that the quality of our product brands is maintained by such licensees, we cannot be certain that such licensees will not take actions that might hurt the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.
   11
 
  LICENSE OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
   On occasion, we in-licensed both exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property and patents owned by third parties. These license agreements typically require royalties and other payments. 
   We have a royalty agreement in which it has obtained rights to manufacture and market an ACTH test (used to detect chronic metabolic conditions). Royalty expense of approximately $11,000 and $15,000, respectively, is included in cost of sales for this agreement for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020. Sales of products manufactured under this agreement are non-material to total sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We may license other products or technology in the future as it deems necessary or opportunistic for conducting business.
   In May, 2020, we signed an exclusive license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, to license patents pertaining to a CRISPR-based technology that we hope to use to produce a rapid test for the COVID-19 virus, that could be used to test individuals to determine if they are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. This agreement requires the payment of certain milestone payments and a royalty on all sales that utilize the licensed technology. Collaboration efforts with the University on a CRISPR product that may be commercialized using this technology continues, however, there are no imminent plans to launch a product from this collaboration. 
   Some of the products that we manufacture, sell or use may be covered by claims in issued patents held by other persons or entities, and as such, upon notice from such persons or entity we may be required to pay a license fee or may be required to cease all manufacture, sale or use of such products, which could negatively impact us. While we have not been notified of any such claims by third parties, we cannot guarantee that such claims will not be made in the future. 
   We are nearing completion of the endpoint determination clinical trial for our patented InFoods® IBS diagnostic guided therapy product. Our business model for this product includes the possible licensing of this product to a large international life sciences or technology company that would commercialize the product or assist us with the commercialization. 
   BRANDS AND TRADEMARKS
   We occasionally register our tradenames with the Office of Patents and Trademarks. Of note, we registered the tradename “InFoods” on December 24, 2016.

   PATENTS AND INFOODS TECHNOLOGY
   We have filed over 100 international and Patent Corporation Treaty patents, and has 12 provisional and non-provisional patents currently filed with the USPTO. Some of these patent applications pertain to COVID-19 and other products, however, the majority of our patents that are pending, allowed or issued pertain to the InFoods® technology platform.
   Our most important family of patent applications pertains to our InFoods® technology platform, which is a new method of possibly diagnosing and treating symptoms of many different diseases. Our first planned product launch using this technology is the InFoods® IBS product which is designed to diagnose and treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Using a patient blood sample, a physician or lab can run our test to identify specific foods (e.g. pork, milk, shrimp, broccoli, eggs) that, if eliminated from the patient’s diet, can alleviate or reduce the individual's IBS symptoms, including, but not limited to, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, cramping, severe pain and indigestion. We have filed many patent applications with the USPTO and with other such similar agencies in other countries outside of the United States pertaining to this InFoods® technology. These patent applications include claims that address the diagnosis and treatment of several disease states including IBS, functional dyspepsia, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, migraine headaches and depression. These applications include the use of this technology in both humans and animals.  The first patents filed by us pertained to IBS. Several of the patents pertaining to the InFoods® IBS technology have been issued and many more are in active review and prosecution.

  In August 2018, the Korean Intellectual Property Office (“KIPO”) issued a Certificate of Patent (#10-1887545) covering our InFoods® IBS product (entitled “COMPOSITIONS, DEVICES, AND METHODS OF IBS SENSIVITY TESTING”). This patent was the first for the InFoods® patent portfolio, providing patent protection for InFoods® IBS in Korea until November 13, 2035.
   In June 2019, we received our first issued patent from the USPTO (#10,309,970) pertaining to our InFoods® IBS product, with claims that covers the test kit that is used to determine patient food intolerances.  
   In March 2020, the Japanese Patent Office issued our first InFoods® IBS patent in that country (6681907) which covers the compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing.
 In September 2020, the USPTO issued our second InFoods® IBS patent in the U.S. (10,788,498) which covers IBS sensitivity testing.
   In November 2020, the Singapore Patent Office issued our first InFoods® IBS patent in that country (11201705102Q) which covers the compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing.
   In March 2021, the Korean Patent Office issued a second InFoods® IBS patent in that country (10-2224649) which covers the compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing.
   In April 2021, the Japanese Patent Office issued a notice of allowance for an InFoods® IBS patent in that country (6876338) which covers the compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing.
   In May 2021, the Company received a notice of allowance for an InFoods® IBS patent in Mexico which covers the compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing.
   We believe the claims in these issued InFoods® IBS patents, and claims in pending patents that protect the use of the InFoods® IBS  technology to diagnose and treat other diseases, provide us with broad protections from other companies making or selling competing products in this highly disruptive new field of medicine.  
   In addition to the use of our own patents, Biomerica has acquired from third parties the rights to manufacture and sell certain products that are protected by patents or intellectual property owned by these third parties. In some cases, royalties are paid on the sales of these products. Biomerica anticipates that it will license or purchase the rights to other products or technologies in the future. 
   We are nearing completion of the endpoint determination clinical trial for our patented InFoods® IBS diagnostic guided therapy product. Our business model for this product includes the possible out-licensing of this product and the related patents to a large international life sciences or technology company that would commercialize the product or assist us with the commercialization.
