Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells directly within the patient’s body. We believe our proprietary Immuno-STAT™ (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T Cells) platform, as described below, will allow us to harness the fullest potential of an individual’s intrinsic immune repertoire for restoring health while avoiding the deleterious side effects of broad immune activation (for immuno-oncology or infectious immunity) or broad immune suppression (for autoimmunity and inflammation). In addition to the selective modulation of T cell activity, we believe Immuno-STATs offer several key points of potential differentiation over competing approaches, including modularity and versatility providing broad disease coverage, manufacturability, and convenient administration.
 Through rational protein engineering, we leverage the modular and versatile nature of the Immuno-STAT platform to design drug product candidates for selective immune modulation in cancer, chronic infectious disease, and autoimmune disease. To address the needs of these clinical indications, we have developed four biologic series within the Immuno-STAT platform: CUE-100, CUE-200, CUE-300, and CUE-400, each specifically designed through rational engineering to possess distinct signaling modules for desired biological mechanisms that may be applied across many diseases.  The CUE-100 series exploits rationally engineered IL-2 in context of the core Immuno-STAT framework for selective activation of targeted tumor-specific T cells, while the CUE-200 series is focused on cell surface receptors including CD80 and/or 4-1BBL to address T cell exhaustion associated with chronic infections. The CUE-300 series, being developed for autoimmune diseases, incorporates the inhibitory PD-L1 co-modulator for selective inhibition of the autoreactive T cell repertoire.  This approach is pertinent for autoimmune diseases with known, well characterized, limited or few autoantigens, such as type 1 diabetes. The CUE-400 series, for autoimmune diseases with diverse or unknown autoantigens, represents a novel class of bispecific molecules that can selectively and effectively expand induced regulatory T cells, or iTregs. We categorize these molecules as “pathway-specific modulators” or PSM. The first candidate, CUE-401, incorporates the two key biological signals that are necessary for generation of iTregs, namely IL-2 and TGF-beta. Based on structure-based rational protein engineering, both IL-2 and TGF-beta have been affinity tuned (i.e. the binding strength has been optimized) to maintain on-target engagement while minimizing systemic toxicities. 
 Our drug product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development, and while we believe that these candidates hold potential value, our activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. We have not yet commenced any commercial revenue-generating operations, have limited cash flows from operations, and will need to access additional capital to fund our growth and ongoing business operations.

Our Immuno-STAT Platform Pipeline
 The pipeline below details our current portfolio assets and their stages of development. CUE-101 is our most advanced clinical stage asset, currently being dosed in a Phase1 monotherapy trial for human papilloma virus (HPV)-driven recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck cancer, as well as in a first line Phase 1 combination trial with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in the same indication. CUE-102 focuses on Wilm’s tumor-1 (WT1) as the tumor antigen.
 

We have made significant progress advancing the IL-2-based CUE-100 series for oncology.  We dosed the first patient in September 2019 in a monotherapy Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of CUE-101 for the treatment of HPV16-driven recurrent/metastatic, or R/M, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, in late-stage treatment-refractory patients with R/M HNSCC who have received and failed several prior lines of systemic therapy including checkpoint inhibitors such as KEYTRUDA, already approved for first-line, or 1L, HPV+R/M HNSCC. To date CUE-101 has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile in the monotherapy trial and continues to generate encouraging emerging data pertaining to its pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, profile, as well as anti-tumor clinical activity. 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2020 we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial into the first-line R/M HNSCC setting to evaluate the combination of CUE-101 with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck’s, anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA®.  The first patient in this combination study was dosed in the first quarter of 2021.  The potential synergy with KEYTRUDA is due to CUE-101’s design and protein engineering to selectively activate and expand tumor-targeted T cells directly in the patient’s body.  We believe the potential of CUE-101 to synergize with and enhance the clinical activity of KEYTRUDA is mechanistically attractive since the presence of expanded tumor-specific T cells are a pre-requisite for and an obligatory target of anti-PD-1.  In preclinical studies, we have observed activation and expansion of the targeted T cells circulating in the peripheral blood, as well as a significant expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.  In addition to the Phase 1 monotherapy and combination trial with KEYTRUDA, we also intend to initiate a neoadjuvant study in locally advanced HPV+ HNSCC patients in the second half of 2021, which is expected to provide further mechanistic evidence and insights into the activation and effector function of T cells resident in tumor tissue and their impact on tumor viability.  
 
CUE-101 is the most advanced candidate from our IL-2 based CUE-100 series and is exemplary of the union of the rational protein engineering underscoring the Immuno-STAT platform and key immunological targets, or activity nodes, to selectively enhance anti-tumor immunity.  Data relating to this work were recently published in a peer-reviewed journal (Quayle et al., Clinical Cancer Research 2020, https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2020/01/15/1078-0432.CCR-19-3354).  Importantly, we believe that the totality of clinical data with CUE-101, effectively reduces the risk profile of the IL-2 based CUE-100 series due to the fact that the core framework of the CUE-100 series remains essentially the same for each drug candidate, except for the targeting peptide epitope within the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, pocket or the human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, in humans.  Therefore, with the exception of some protein engineering modifications to ensure stability and manufacturability the core IL-2 scaffold is a shared molecular feature of all molecules generated within this series (including CUE-102, and the next-gen platform, Neo-STATTM, as described below).

We are also advancing a pipeline of additional promising preclinical candidates that we believe hold the potential to treat multiple cancers.  Data from our second candidate of the CUE-100 series, CUE-102 (WT1) were recently presented at the New York Academy of Science, or NYAS, Frontiers in Cancer Immunotherapy meeting and at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, meeting in November 2020. These data support early evidence of selective T cell expansion, along with polyfunctional effector function including killing of target cells. We are continuing to develop CUE-102 toward an investigational new drug application, or IND, through enabling studies, and we anticipate filing an investigational new drug application, or IND, for this candidate in the first half of 2022.  We have also generated foundational data with Immuno-STATs targeting the mutated G12V KRAS T cell epitope including demonstration of activation and expansion of T cells expressing G12V-specific T cell receptors, or TCRs. These data were presented at the SITC meeting in November 2020 and more recently at the Immuno-Oncology conference, IO-360, in February 2021.
 
Importantly, through rational protein engineering, we have expanded the reach of the Immuno-STAT platform to potentially address the heterogeneity and diversity of many cancers by developing a derivative scaffold from the CUE-100 series that contains stable “peptide-less” or “empty” MHC pocket or human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, molecules, to which peptides of interest may be covalently attached. We refer to this derivative scaffold as Neo-STAT™.   Neo-STAT is designed to provide greater flexibility for targeting multiple tumor epitopes, enhance production efficiencies, decrease time and cost to manufacture and potentially lend itself to personalized neo-antigen strategies in cancer immunotherapy as an off-the-shelf approach.
 
In addition to oncology, we have made recent advances in autoimmune diseases where our core strategy has centered on two major themes: (i) modulating antigen-specific T cells with Immuno-STATs in diseases with restricted or known autoantigens (e.g., type 1 diabetes), and (ii) exploiting a pathway-specific approach via modalities focused on regulatory T cells and other mechanisms that could be broadly applied to autoimmune diseases with unknown or diverse autoantigens. In the first instance we have made significant advances with the CUE-300 series for targeting antigen-specific T cells in autoimmune disorders, including progress made in our collaboration with Merck which was recently extended and further supported through 2021.  To date, we have generated proof of concept data demonstrating the potential for targeting autoreactive T cells in type 1 diabetes; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CUE-Merck-Autoimmune-Data.pdf.  Based upon the promising progress we have made through our Merck collaboration to date, we expect to further develop a growing pipeline of autoimmune candidates throughout 2021. 
 
Additionally, we have expanded our reach into chronic autoimmune diseases with diverse and/or uncharacterized antigens by focusing on activating and increasing regulatory T cells for re-setting immune balance. Our first candidate from this effort, CUE-401, incorporates two key signals, namely IL-2 and TGF-beta, for differentiation and expansion of iTregs. 
 
Furthermore, we are assessing the potential of developing programs from the Immuno-STAT platform for treating infectious diseases with the CUE-200 series through research being conducted by Dr. Steven Almo, a co-founder of the company and Chair of Biochemistry at The Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Data supporting these applications were recently presented at the SITC meeting in November 2020; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Immuno-STAT-SITC-2020-Poster.pdf.
 
Our Business Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough, highly selective and differentiated biologics for safe and effective therapeutic immune modulation directly in patients having high unmet medical need. In order to achieve this objective, we are focused on the following strategies:
 Advance and establish our IL-2-based CUE-100 series, as demonstrated by our lead Immuno-STAT program, CUE-101
  
• | Through CUE-101 we intend to demonstrate that IL-2 can be selectively and tolerably delivered to the specific cellular immune compartment that is relevant for anti-tumor immunity. This is in contrast to other approaches that are focused on systemic delivery of IL-2 variants with little specificity for the anti-tumor T cell repertoire.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We plan to execute clinical trials that are designed with a translational approach to demonstrate CUE-101’s ability to selectively activate and expand patients’ own endogenous HPV16-specific T cell repertoire to target, attack and kill tumor cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We plan to expand patient access and potentially enhance clinical outcomes by addressing the significant unmet patient need first by establishing foundational mechanistic evidence in the second line and beyond monotherapy Phase 1 clinical trial for HPV16-driven R/M HNSCC, then in first line therapy in combination with anti-PD1 therapy, where it is our intention to generate evidence of synergy with a checkpoint blockade. We also plan to further expand into newly diagnosed HPV16-driven R/M HNSCC with a Phase 1 neoadjuvant trial designed to study surgically excised tumors after the patients have received two to three dose regimens of CUE-101, potentially allowing us to gather further data that may demonstrate mechanistic evidence of selective T cell activation, proliferation and infiltration of tumor tissue resulting in tumor cell killing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are working to build a clinical data set that demonstrates the PK/PD, tolerability and anti-tumor effect of CUE-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with HPV16-driven HNSCC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leverage our modular and versatile Immuno-STAT platform to generate and advance a pipeline of Immuno-STATs and Neo-STATs with strategic partnering to enable global patient reach
 
 
• | Within the CUE-100 series, we are expanding our clinical reach through a collaboration and strategic territory partnership with LG Chem, Ltd., or LG Chem, for CUE-101, CUE-102 and CUE-103 for Asian markets. Through this collaboration and partnership, we are able to reach patients within the Asian territory.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beyond the IL-2-based CUE-100 series for addressing a broad range of cancers, we have a growing pipeline of therapeutic frameworks and programs designed to address the significant, unmet medical need for treating serious, life threatening indications, such as autoimmune disease and infectious disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The recent extension of our collaboration with Merck, encompassing two defined autoimmune indications, including type I diabetes, or T1D, allows us to further progress the CUE-300 series, which is focused on targeting antigen-specific T cells in autoimmune disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We continue to evaluate the mechanisms within the CUE-200 series via research being conducted at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to demonstrate the ability to enhance T cell activation and/ or reverse T cell exhaustion, an area of critical need for infectious disease. Mechanistic data demonstrating proof-of-concept were recently disclosed at the SITC meeting in November 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will continue to selectively explore other opportunities to create value from the protein engineering platform and may further develop these programs with or without partners.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expand and enhance our core capabilities and Immuno-STAT platform 
  
• | We view protein engineering and translational immunology as our core competencies, and to expand our competitive advantages, we plan to continue to invest in these areas to further optimize the platform for rapid and cost-effective drug development. We may also in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Our Approach
 
The Immune System and T Cell Immunity
 
As highlighted in the figure below, we believe a critical component of human health is achieving and maintaining a state of immune balance.  Imbalance of the immune system underscores many diseased states: susceptibility to cancers and infectious disease can be attributed to inadequate or compromised/attenuated immune responses, while autoimmune diseases result from an overactive immune response reacting against the host.
 
7


Restoring Immune Balance 


The human immune system comprises a number of specialized cell types that collectively function to identify and defend the body against foreign threats. One such specialized cell type, the human T cell, is a subtype of a white blood cell that plays a central role in the immune system. During an immune response, T cells are activated via close encounters with a specialized cell type known as the antigen presenting cell, or APC. Prominent APC types include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The primary function of an APC is to uptake antigens, primarily proteins, catabolize, (i.e., break them down into peptides) and display them on their cell-surface in complex with specialized molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex molecules or human leukocyte antigen, or MHC (HLA in humans). This critical function of an APC, also referred to as “antigen processing and presentation”, ultimately results in generation of the key molecular substrate – the peptide MHC complex (pMHC will also be used to designate pHLA in humans) – that is recognized by the T cell via its T cell receptor, or TCR. 
 
The source of the antigen for the APC is vast and expansive: antigens from pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and others activate T cells for protective immunity; antigens from tumor cells are key for robust anti-tumor T cell responses; and antigens from self-tissue are aberrantly recognized by autoreactive T cells that ultimately induce damage to the host. Hence, the nature of the pMHC complex on the APC sets the specificity of the T cell response. The intimate interactions between the T cells and APCs occur within a molecular interface known as the immunological or immune synapse (as shown in the figure below) wherein the TCR-pMHC engagement as well as additional accessary signals are sensed by T cells resulting in T cell activation or regulation. In essence, the immune synapse allows controlled engagement and selective activation of T cells through the presentation of two distinct signals: Signal 1, TCR engagement of the pMHC; and Signal 2, activating co-stimulatory (or co-inhibitory signals).  The core protein framework for the Immuno-STAT platform builds upon our ability to combine the key signals for T cell modulation (i.e., Signal 1 and Signal 2) into a singular molecular scaffold, as shown below.
 
8


Immuno-STAT Platform Framework
 
Signal 1: A stabilized peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC), Class I or II, to selectively engage disease-relevant T cells by incorporating diverse antigenic peptides of interest and choosing different MHC (or HLA) alleles to provide broad coverage for global patient populations. 
 Signal 2: Distinct co-stimulatory or co-regulatory signals, including cytokines, cell-surface receptors, and other targeting modalities, to control the activity of disease-relevant T cells.
 Fc Backbone: Well-characterized protein construct from human antibodies to provide stability and ease of manufacturability that can be engineered to dial in or out biological and effector functions.
 

While the elegant and dynamic nature of T cell-APC interactions is an essential component of immunity or tolerance (i.e., not reactive to self), it is often encumbered by many considerations including: (i) antigen availability and release for presentation by APCs; (ii) antigen uptake and processing efficiencies of an APC that generate the appropriate pMHC complex for the T cell; (iii) stability, amount and turnover of pMHC complexes displayed on the cell surface of an APC; (iv) the “right” kind of the APC phenotype for the desired biological outcome (e.g. activating versus tolerogenic); (v) effects of the local tissue/tumor microenvironment on the APC (e.g., immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments directly impede local APC function in the tumor lesion); and (vi) the absolute dependency on localization and encounter of the right T cell with the right APC in the individual. 
 
These challenges could be potentially circumvented if the essential components for T cell activation (i.e., pMHC complex and appropriate co-stimulatory signals) are provided to the T cells directly with no dependency on the APCs. This is the core focus of the Immuno-STAT platform.
 

The Immuno-STAT: “Immune Responses, on Cue”
 
Through rational protein engineering, we are developing a proprietary class of Immuno-STAT drug product candidates to selectively modulate the activity of antigen-specific T cells directly in a patient’s body. Our Immuno-STATs modulate T cell activity via two distinct signals, emulating or “mimicking” the signals presented naturally within the immune synapse when the body is mounting an immune response. We accomplish this signaling through the fusion of a TCR targeting pMHC complex (i.e., Signal 1) with co-stimulatory signaling molecules (i.e., Signal 2). This co-engagement of signals through the TCR and co-stimulatory receptor mimics and recapitulates the signals encountered in nature by T cells upon successful interactions with APCs. Hence, the Immuno-STATs harness “nature’s cues” for antigen specificity, along with appropriate secondary activating or inhibitory signals, resulting in targeted T cell modulation.
 During the last decade, there has been substantial progress in therapeutically modifying the function of immune cells, such as T cells, to either enhance tumor killing in the context of oncology, or protect tissue in the context of autoimmune disease.  Much of the focus has centered on approaches that result in broad and non-specific/non-selective immune modulation (e.g., cytokines, cytokine inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and bi-specifics) with significant challenges remaining to be addressed regarding specificity, efficacy and patient safety.  
 9

More recently in oncology, adoptive cell therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts, TCR-Ts or ACTs) have shown promise in a process requiring the extraction and modification of T cells from patients, activating, stimulating, and expanding them outside the body (i.e., ex vivo) and then infusing large numbers of cells back into the patients for potential therapeutic benefit.  While these approaches have demonstrated some encouraging and impressive clinical responses in several hematologic malignancies, and some solid cancers, they are also associated with significant toxicities, including life threatening cytokine release syndrome and induction of self-reactivity. Moreover, labor-intensive technical requirements and expense associated with individualized T cell extraction, ex vivo amplification /modification, and patient re-infusion represent significant scaling and cost challenges.  This is in addition to the rigorous procedures required to condition the patient prior to re-infusion might limit broad usage and eventual successful commercialization of this therapeutic modality.
 
We believe that our Immuno-STAT and other protein engineering drug product candidates may offer important key features of potential clinical differentiation and advantages over competing immunotherapy approaches, including:
 
 
• | “Off-the-Shelf” and ready to use biologics that specifically target and selectively modulate disease relevant T cells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administration directly into the patient’s body without involving ex-vivo manipulation of T cells (e.g., cell therapy) or rigorous pre- and post- therapy conditioning of the patient;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Freedom from the barriers of natural antigen presentation via antigen presenting cells, APCs, or the phenotype of APC; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to target disease specific T cells with specificity, and selectively control the quantity and quality of a modulator/co-stimulator signal in contrast to global activation through systemic, non-selective signaling (e.g., rIL-2, bi-specifics, etc.).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therapeutic Applications
 
An insufficient T cell response may result in susceptibility to cancers or chronic infectious diseases. Conversely, an aberrant overactive T cell response against self-tissue results in autoimmune disease. In each of the above diseased states, the desired therapeutic approach should specifically target the dysregulated immune axis thereby providing the maximal potential for patient benefit.

• | In the context of cancer and chronic infectious disease, Immuno-STATs are designed to selectively activate disease-specific T cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For the treatment of autoimmune disease, Immuno-STATs are designed to selectively inhibit pathogenic autoreactive T cells. In those autoimmune diseases where the antigen(s) remain unknown, or entail multiple antigens, we have developed a biologic that has demonstrated in early studies to provide a potent signal 2, IL2-TGFβ, to Tregs where active autoimmune disease involves the endogenous presence of “Signal 1”. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to leverage the platform’s modularity and versatility to design Immuno-STATs addressing the particular therapeutic objectives of T cell modulation. We achieve this through the flexibility of designing the various components of Immuno-STATs, including different co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory signals across disease areas (e.g., cancer vs. autoimmune) and different specific targeting peptides associated with various indications (e.g., head and neck cancer vs. breast cancer); and different global patient populations via targeting distinct HLA alleles. The modularity of this unique platform, as highlighted in the above figure, provides us the opportunity to generate therapeutic molecules across many different indications to serve distinct patient populations and allows the design of novel constructs incorporating structures having desired combined properties, e.g., IL2-TGF-β for Treg modulation.  The figure below exemplifies the platform modularity to accommodate diverse T cell epitopes for different disease indications, distinct activating or inhibitory secondary signals, and the incorporation of diverse HLA molecules.

Potential Commercialization Advantages
 
In addition to the selective control of T cell activity, we believe our Immuno-STAT platform provides us with several key points of potential superiority and differentiation over competing approaches:

• | Access to a broad set of disease targets (extracellular and intracellular antigens) and patient populations (diverse HLA types) providing access to broad patient reach with the ability to address diverse disease conditions;

Immuno-Oncology
 CUE-100 Series
 ​Drug product candidates developed within our CUE-100 framework selectively stimulate the IL-2 receptor, a potent activator of the pathway critical to the growth, expansion and survival of T cells. We have engineered the CUE-100 framework to activate specific T cell populations through pMHC targeting of TCRs and selective deployment of the IL-2 signal. The IL-2 component of the framework has been modified to minimize engagement of the high affinity IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) and reduce the affinity on the beta chain (CD122).  This enables our Immuno-STATs to harness the cooperative nature of T cell signaling via preferentially activating tumor specific T-cells via the pMHC-TCR  binding/targeting without systemically activating other T cell populations, thereby potentially mitigating the dose-limiting toxicities associated with current IL-2-based therapies. This effect is supported by our emerging CUE-101 monotherapy clinical data, where we have successfully dosed this molecule up to 8 mg/kg in second line and beyond R/M HNSCC patients. In contrast, other IL-2 variants, such as the variants of the so-called “not-alpha” IL-2 modalities, have remained in the low μg/kg dosing concentrations.

We believe the selective deployment of our rationally designed and engineered IL-2 molecules in context of the Immuno-STAT framework may provide superior differentiation over competing approaches focused on IL-2, including the “not-alpha” IL-2 variants wherein the modified IL-2 possesses no bias towards tumor-specific T cells. The graphic below summarizes some of the key biological factors and considerations of the different approaches.
 CUE-100 Series: Differentiation Over Existing Modalities Targeting IL-2

12


CUE-101
 Our lead product candidate from the CUE-100 framework, CUE-101, contains IL-2 and a pMHC composed of HLA-A*02:01 complexed with a dominant peptide derived from the human papilloma virus E7 protein (HPV-E7), as shown in the figure below.  It is a fusion protein biologic designed to target and activate antigen-specific T cells to fight HPV-driven cancers.
 


We have performed extensive in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical studies with CUE-101, which have been published in Clinical Cancer Research (Quayle et. al. CUE-101, a Novel HPV16 E7-pHLA-IL-2-Fc Fusion Protein, Enhances Tumor Antigen Specific T Cell Activation for the Treatment of HPV16-Driven Malignancies https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2020/01/15/1078-0432.CCR-19-3354)
CUE-101 Clinical Development Plan
 In September 2019, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of CUE-101 for the treatment of HPV16-driven R/M HNSCC. This program is representative of the IL-2 based CUE-100 series for which we have generated a robust preclinical data package, including activation of human HPV specific T cells from human blood, as noted above. Our initial CUE-101 Phase 1 monotherapy trial focuses on R/M HNSCC, where patients will likely have received several lines of systemic therapy including checkpoint inhibition.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, we extended this Phase 1 clinical trial into the front-line R/M HNSCC setting to evaluate the combination of CUE-101 with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA. This combination study will offer the opportunity to assess relevant biomarkers of CUE-101 activity in peripheral blood when administered as a first line therapy.  To date, we have generated promising early data sets from our Phase 1 monotherapy trial demonstrating dose dependent peripheral expansion of E7- specific CD8+ T cells as well as dose proportional pharmacokinetics. To date, CUE-101 has been well tolerated, demonstrating early signs of clinical activity, including signs of anti-tumor effect.  A synopsis of data observed were recently presented at the SITC meeting in November 2020; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Pai_CUE-101-01_SITC-2020-Abstract-354.pdf. During the first half of 2021, we plan to expand patient enrollment in selected cohorts to generate additional data that will inform our selection of the recommended Phase 2 dose.
 
13


We view R/M HNSCC as an important first market opportunity for CUE-101 with the potential for accelerated approval. Head and neck cancer was the seventh most common cancer worldwide in 2018 (650,000 new cases and 330,000 deaths), accounting for 3% of all cancers (51,540 new cases) and just over 1.5% of all cancer deaths (10,030 deaths) in the United States alone and more than 20,000 deaths each year in the US and Europe combined. A majority of these cancers are driven by HPV-16, which carries the E7 antigen targeted by CUE-101. Despite treatment with current standards of care, approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease will experience recurrence and significant quality of life impact.  Patients with HPV-driven head and neck, cervical and genitoanal cancers represent an important unmet clinical need and underscore the opportunity for promising new therapeutics.
 Cases of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, induced primarily by HPV type 16, are increasing, in North America and western Europe.  The fraction of head and neck cancers diagnosed as HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the United States rose from just 16% in the 1980s to more than 70% in the 2000s. In addition to HNSCC, we also intend to pursue expansion studies for cervical cancers which we view as an attractive opportunity with significant unmet need and potentially other HPV-driven cancers (e.g., anal, vulvar, etc.). Outside of the US and EU, we will work with our partner LG Chem to commercialize CUE-101 in Asia, if approved.
 CUE-102
 CUE-102 leverages the same CUE-100 framework with a pMHC derived from the Wilms’ Tumor protein, or WT1, an oncofetal antigen known to be over-expressed in a number of cancers, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We have generated a comprehensive pre-clinical data set with CUE-102 to support our planned IND filing in the first half of 2022, highlights of which are shown in the figure below. We have observed ex-vivo expansion of WT1-specific T cells from primary human donors, and in vivo expansion of T cells in HLA-A02 transgenic mice treated with CUE-102. Importantly, we observed T cells expanded with CUE-102 activating polyfunctionality and cytotoxic killing of target cells, both of which are key attributes of a desirable anti-tumor T cell response.  These data were also presented at the SITC meeting in November 2020. In 2021, we plan to continue to progress with our IND enabling studies for this program in collaboration with our partner LG Chem.  Similar to CUE-101, CUE-102 is a fusion protein biologic built on the IL-2 based CUE-100 series designed to target and activate antigen-specific T cells to fight cancers—in the case of CUE-102, those overexpressing WT1.
 WT1 is known to be expressed in more than 20 different cancers, including both solid tumors (e.g., ovarian, pancreatic, lung) and hematologic malignancies (e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes).  Patients with WT1 associated cancers represent an important unmet clinical need and underscore the opportunity for promising new therapeutics.

CUE-103
 CUE-103 will also leverage the IL-2 based CUE-100 framework and target an antigen to be selected in collaboration with LG Chem.  We are currently in active discussions with LG Chem regarding the evaluation of several candidate tumor antigens to be selected for the CUE-103 drug product candidate.

We are also developing a CUE-100 series Immuno-STAT for targeting the KRAS G12V mutation, which generates a T cell epitope in the context of HLA-A11. This mutation is associated with many solid tumors including colorectal carcinoma, or CRC, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. We believe the KRAS G12V T cell epitope provides a novel opportunity for therapeutic intervention of a primary tumor driver like KRAS. Data suggesting the feasibility of production of HLA-A11 Immuno-STATs and their functional activity on cells expressing T cell receptors specific for G12V were recently disclosed at the SITC meeting in November 2020 (https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cemerski_CUE-100_series_SITC_poster_553_FINAL.pdf). These data further underscore the modularity of the Immuno-STAT platform by extending the application to include additional HLA alleles, in this case HLA-A11.
CUE-200 Framework
 .
 The CUE-200 framework utilizes co-stimulatory cell surface receptors, including CD80 and/or 4-1BBL, to reactivate exhausted T cells and is designed to promote enhanced antigen-specific T cell activation and function for the treatment of chronic infectious diseases.  Both CD80/CD28 and 4-1BBL/4-1BB pathways have been implicated in enhancing anti-tumor T cell responses, including re-invigorating exhausted T cells. We see this as a unique opportunity to potentially harness and deploy these co-stimulatory signaling molecules to selectively modulate anti-tumor T cells.  We continue to evaluate these mechanisms within the CUE-200 series via research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Early data supporting these potential applications were disclosed at the SITC meeting in November 2020; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Immuno-STAT-SITC-2020-Poster.pdf.
 
Neo-STAT Platform 
 
In addition to the Immuno-STAT biologics described above, engineered as fusion protein biologics requiring dedicated stable cell lines for production of good manufacturing practice, or GMP, material, we are also developing a next generation derivative approach, referred to as Neo-STAT™, that we expect could significantly enhance productivity and increase our flexibility, including targeting multiple tumor antigens, neo-antigens and post-translationally modified epitopes. A key focus of the Neo-STAT platform is to generate a “peptide-less” or “empty” MHC pocket within the Immuno-STAT scaffold of the CUE-100 series. We then deploy peptide-conjugation chemistry to covalently attach peptides to the Neo-STAT scaffold. To that end, Neo-STAT has the potential to provide enhanced productivities and greater flexibility enabling the ability to generate therapeutic molecules targeting multiple tumor antigens, including post-translationally modified antigens (e.g., targeting of phospho-peptides from tumor cells), and to develop future strategies to deploy the Neo-STAT platform for personalized tumor neo-antigens. Importantly, the Neo-STAT framework should enable us to maximize our efficiencies – both from a cost- and timing-perspective.
 
We have made significant promising progress with our Neo-STAT platform, including proof of concept, or PoC, experiments demonstrating expansion and activation of primary human T cells with HLA-A02 Neo-STAT molecules deploying different T cell epitopes including tumor antigens (MART-1) or infectious antigens (CMV, SARS-Cov-2), as examples. We presented a detailed description on the protein engineering of the Neo-STAT platform at the Protein Engineering and Cell Therapy Summit, or PEGS, meeting in August 2020; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/themes/cuebio/images/2020-PEGS-Poster.mp4. In 2021, we plan to continue to progress the Neo-STAT platform with specific efforts focused on generation of HLA-A02-based stable cell line to support our future GMP material and on peptide-conjugation process development to support the generation of our clinical grade material for future applications.

Neo-STATs and Immuno-STATs with the Same Antigenic Peptide Activate Peptide Specific CD8+ T Cells


Leveraging Immuno-STATs to address tumor resistance mechanisms through antigen presentation defects and HLA loss.
 
A significant and ongoing challenge in tumor immunotherapy pertains to tumor resistance or escape mechanisms whereby a subset of tumors are able to evade T cell detection, by suppressing or downregulating the production of proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation of tumor antigens/epitopes to the adaptive immune system, including T cells. Among the escape mechanisms are changes or mutations of the antigen processing compartment (e.g., TAP transporters) or antigen presentation molecules (such as HLA or ß2-microglobulin), which make the tumor invisible to the anti-tumor T cells. The loss of immunogenicity of the tumor is an adaptive evolution of the cancer to avoid immune detection – a stage defined as the escape phase of cancer immuno-editing. It is estimated that upwards of 20%-30% of patients may have tumor cells utilizing this escape mechanism.
 
Our approach to addressing this escape mechanism takes advantage of related observations from detailed cellular analysis of human cancer tissues revealing the significant presence of CD8+ T cells that are not specific for the tumor antigens but instead recognizing viral antigens (such as EBV, flu or CMV). In other words, a significant fraction of the protective memory anti-viral T cell repertoire localizes to the tumor tissue, likely in response to chemotactic signals that are agnostic of specificity of the T cells. 
 
Hence, we have investigated the opportunity to leverage the Immuno-STAT platform to generate therapeutic molecules to re-direct or “trick” the viral T cell repertoire present in the tumor environment to recognize and kill the cancer cells, including those that have lost the expression of HLA molecules or the ability to present antigen effectively. We believe this approach has several unique advantages: (i) it circumvents the tumor’s lack of HLA or antigen presentation; (ii) it harnesses a pre-existing robust anti-viral protective T cell repertoire within the host; (iii) it is an opportunity to alter the tumor microenvironment via localizing an active immune response; (iv) from a safety perspective, this approach is very distinct from other bispecific molecules that indiscriminately activate every T cell; and (v) it leverages the clinical de-risking provided by CUE-101, especially as it relates to the IL-2 molecules. 
 The schematic below describes the generation of viral-specific Immuno-STATs that can be tethered to a tumor cell via binding to tumor cell-surface antigens (e.g., Trop2, PSMA, mesothelin etc). Thus, in this manner the tumor is coated with a viral Immuno-STAT to make it appear like a virally-infected cancer cell, which can then be recognized by the anti-viral T cells that populate the host and the tumor tissue and become activated by the Immuno-STAT IL-2 to kill the tumor cell. Through rational protein engineering we have generated early proof of concept, or PoC, molecules that provide us confidence with the applicability of these unique bispecific Immuno-STATs for cancer immuno-therapy. We call these “re-directed” Immuno-STATs, or RDI-STATs.

Viral T Cell Redirection via RDI STATs : Immuno-STAT Framework with Tumor Targeting TAA

Redirected Immuno-STATs (RDI-STATs) can leverage the patient’s existing protective viral T cell repertoire to target tumors, regardless of the tumor HLA expression.
 
All of the above applications of the Immuno-STAT and Neo-STAT platform may benefit from the ongoing risk-reducing data generation via the current clinical studies with CUE-101, especially as it relates to the tolerability profile of the engineered IL-2 variant and this novel biologics platform. This is due to the fact that the core framework of the CUE-100 series remains essentially the same for each drug candidate, except for the targeting peptide epitope within the MHC pocket.
 
Clinical risk-reduction of CUE-100 Series via CUE-101 Clinical Studies Enables Broad Pipeline of Platform Opportunities
 

We have implemented a strategy of exploiting the potential applications of the CUE-100 series framework into multiple derivative constructs possessing specific properties and mechanistic activities to address diverse clinical conditions involving immune imbalance.  Through this approach, we have designed and engineered various biologic constructs each 
 17

possessing desired activities with the potential for addressing underlying immune re-balancing to restore better health.  Through this approach, as depicted in the figure below, we have exploited the CUE-100 series to develop a growing pipeline of Immuno-STATs for oncology, have created the derivative constructs of Neo-STAT and “re-directed” Immuno-STATs (or RDI-STATs) to address resistance mechanisms, and have utilized the frameworks modularity to engineer antigen-specific immune suppressors, (e.g, PD-L1) for treating autoimmune diseases (CUE-300 series) with known auto-antigens (such as T1D). We have also deployed the engineered IL-2 variant from the CUE-100 series to design a bi-specific molecule possessing both IL-2 and TGF-beta (CUE-400 series) for pathway specific modulation to stimulate iTregs in autoimmune diseases where the autoantigens are unknown or not well characterized. We believe these various derivatives have a reduced risk-profile due to the fact that CUE-101 has been well tolerated throughout the dose escalation Phase 1 study and, by implication, constructs designed/derivatized from this series have a lowered risk-profile.

Platform Development and Progress in Auto-immune and inflammation

Autoimmune Disease
 
For applications in autoimmune, or AI, diseases, our strategy has focused on two broad themes of antigen-specific modulation and pathway-specific modulation for controlling autoreactive T cell responses. Both approaches complement each other and offer unique opportunities for selective immune re-set of the dysfunctional compartment. The antigen-specific approach is pertinent to diseases with restricted or well-characterized auto-antigens (such as type 1 diabetes, or T1D) and deploys the Immuno-STATs to directly modulate the autoreactive T cells. The pathway-specific approach exploits signals that can induce and sustain regulatory T cells, which can then control a broad population of autoreactive T cells. Hence, this approach may be more applicable to diseases with diverse unknown antigens. It is conceivable that the specific signals for antigen specific regulatory T cells, or Treg, induction could be deployed in an Immuno-STAT framework for generation of antigen-specific Tregs.
Approaches to Modulate Autoreactive T Cell Responses
 


Antigen-specific approach: CUE-300 Immuno-STAT Framework
 
The CUE-300 framework builds upon our antigen-specific approach for AI and has been focused on class II HLA alleles that are recognized by CD4+ T cells.  It has the potential to target a broad range of addressable autoimmune diseases by selectively modulating disease-associated CD4+ T cells so that healthy cells and tissue are protected from immune attack. 
 
To inhibit autoimmune disease associated T cells, Immuno-STATs are engineered to work via two general strategies:
 
 
• | Inhibition (or selective ablation) of autoreactive T cells by selectively delivering inhibitory signals; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selective expansion of antigen specific Tregs to control aberrant activation of autoreactive T cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Immuno-STAT frameworks for AI disease will be designed to influence a subset of T cells known as CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells recognize peptides in the context of MHC class II proteins. Therefore, prototypic Immuno-STAT frameworks in autoimmunity would rely on MHC class II recognition by CD4 T cells. This is distinct from the MHC class I recognition by CD8 T cells that is the basis of our current oncology pipeline.
 
20


Consistent with our strategy to establish focused partnerships with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology organizations to enhance capacity and further our development efforts on selected programs, in November 2017 we entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck for a partnership to research and develop proprietary biologics that focus on two autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes, or T1D, and an undisclosed indication.  This agreement was recently extended through 2021 to support further development and identification of these targeted biologics.  We view this collaboration agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance the CUE-300 series drug product candidates for selected autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also providing us opportunities in autoimmune diseases beyond our partnered programs as well as continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. 
 
During 2021, we will continue to generate data to support proof-of-mechanism and inform the path forward for this program.  CUE-301 is an example of an Immuno-STAT designed for the modulation of CD4+ T cells under the Merck collaboration agreement. In this instance Immuno-STATs with the human class II MHC molecule, HLA-DR0401, or DR4, were generated along with an epitope from pro-insulin (a known autoantigen in type 1 diabetes) and PD-L1 molecule for selective down-modulation of CD4+ T cells reactive to the pro-insulin peptide. The Pro-Insulin-DR4-PD-L1 Immuno-STATs (CUE-301) selectively inhibited the activation and expansion of insulin-specific T cells. In contrast, Immuno-STAT molecules harboring a peptide from glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD, another autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, had no effect, hence demonstrating selectivity and specificity. These data are summarized in the graphic shown below. 
 
Framework and Selective Suppression of Proins-specific T cells In Vitro
 


21


Recently, we have demonstrated the in vivo activity with CUE-301 (Proins-DR4-PDL1 IST), as shown in the figure below. HLA-DR0401 transgenic mice were immunized with a mixture of Proinsulin peptide (Proins 76-90, K88S) and a T cell epitope from the flu virus hemagglutinin protein (HA307-319). Following immunization, mice were treated with a vehicle (left panel) or CUE-301 (right-panel, “IST dose”). T cell activation and expansion was determined at various days post-immunization/treatment via interferon-gamma ELISpot assay. As shown in the left panel, vehicle-treated mice raised comparable T cells to both Proins and HA. In contrast, as shown in the right panel, the mice treated with CUE-301 (“IST Treated Mice”) showed selective abrogation of the Proins-specific T cells while still mounting a T cells response to HA. These in vivo data suggest that selective modulation of T cells with ISTs can be achieved for applications in AI diseases.
 



Additional mechanistic datasets that further extend in vitro and in vivo observations were recently presented at an autoimmune meeting in January 2021; https://www.cuebiopharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20201223_ASIT-Summit-2021.pdf. 
 
Pathway-specific approach: CUE-400 series 
 
The CUE-400 series is focused on the generation of a novel bispecific molecule for differentiation and expansion of iTregs for applications in autoimmune diseases, graft versus host disease, or GVHD, and transplant rejection.  The primary goals of developing the CUE-400 series of molecule is to harness signals that can generate large numbers of regulatory T cells, or Tregs, in the patient to control a broad repertoire of autoreactive and inflammatory T cells. This is especially important in controlling aberrant activation of autoreactive (or allo-reactive) T cells in those conditions where the antigen(s) are unknown or involves multiple antigens, or in chronic stages of autoimmune diseases with extensive epitope spreading involving many different antigens. We believe that harnessing Tregs is an attractive opportunity for re-setting immune balance and restoring functional tolerance.
 
Our focus has centered on expanding functional iTregs, which we believe offer untapped opportunities in autoimmune diseases and graft rejection. In contrast to natural Tregs, or nTregs, that are present in small numbers and constitutively express CD25 (IL-2R alpha), iTregs are derived from the vastly larger component of the normal CD4+ T cell repertoire that is CD25-negative. In contrast to CD25-biased IL-2 variants/muteins that are being pursued for nTregs, our approach incorporates both IL-2 and TGF-beta signals, which are needed for induction and expansion of iTregs.  Importantly, the IL-2 signal in our approach is not biased to CD25 (IL-2R alpha) receptor subunit since the vast majority of the peripheral CD4+ T cell repertoire does not express CD25. We believe that harnessing iTregs over nTregs may have several key advantages: (i) the numbers of nTregs is limited (~2-5% of the CD4+ T cell compartment) since they come differentiated from the thymus with a fixed TCR repertoire, while iTregs can be readily generated from the vast majority of the conventional CD4+ T cell compartment that is diverse and adaptable to the local microenvironment; (ii) from a therapeutic manipulation perspective, we believe the opportunity to convert pathogenic autoreactive T cell into a regulatory phenotype is an attractive opportunity for immune re-set and restoration of immune balance; and (iii) the differentiation of iTregs can be achieved directly in the patient’s body as long as the requisite two key modulators (IL-2 and TGF-beta) can co-localize to the same T cell. In chronic autoimmune diseases, autoreactive T cells are constantly recognizing self-antigens (i.e. Signal 1 of TCR engagement is perpetual), which provides us with an attractive opportunity to co-deliver the IL-2 and TGF-beta to these T cells to convert them into an iTreg phenotype.  
 22


Harnessing structure-based rational protein engineering, we have generated the first molecule from our CUE-400 series, CUE-401, which is a novel IL-2-TGF-beta fusion protein. The structure of CUE-401 is shown below – it has one molecule of IL-2 fused to an Fc along with a masked TGF-beta molecule. Importantly, the IL-2 variant in CUE-401 has already demonstrated tolerability in the clinic since it is the same IL-2 variant that is present in our current clinical candidate CUE-101, albeit in a different valency (CUE-101 harbors 4 molecules of an affinity attenuated IL-2 along with bivalent tumor-peptide-HLA molecules to activate tumor-specific T cells). 
 
CUE-401: Opportunity to Enhance Specificity and Selectivity
 

We have demonstrated that CUE-401 generated iTregs from conventional CD4+ T cells (as measured by robust induction of the master Treg transcription factor FoxP3). As shown below, we were able to generate iTregs from conventional CD4+ T cells from healthy subjects as well as from patients suffering from autoimmune diseases (RA -rheumatoid arthritis; IBD – inflammatory bowel disease). Importantly, in preclinical models, CUE-401 generated iTregs in equivalent or higher numbers when compared to the recombinant wild-type IL-2 and TGF-beta cytokines (“+recombinant cytokines”, as noted in the figure below). Functional assessments have confirmed that these iTregs can suppress T cell responses. Ongoing studies in preclinical models provide additional support for in vivo conversion of iTregs upon single-dose administration of CUE-401. 
 
Induction of iTregs in Healthy Subjects and Patients
 


In contrast to IL-2-directed approaches aiming to expand the limited number and repertoire of nTregs, we believe induction and conversion of the pathogenic autoreactive T cells into iTreg may offer a more meaningful and lasting benefit to the patient.

Our License Agreement with Einstein
 On January 14, 2015, or the Effective Date, we entered into a license agreement, as amended and restated on July 31, 2017 and as amended on October 30, 2018, or the Einstein License, with Albert Einstein College of Medicine, or Einstein, for certain patent rights, or the Patents, relating to our core technology platform for the engineering of biologics to control T cell activity, precision, immune-modulatory drug product candidates, and two supporting technologies that enable the discovery of costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) and T cell targeting peptides. We hold an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, import, make, have made, use, provide, offer to sell, and sell all products, processes and services that use the Patents, including certain technology received from Einstein related thereto, which we refer to as the Licensed Products.
 The Einstein License is a royalty-bearing license obligating us to pay a percentage of proceeds received from sales of categories of Licensed Products at low single digit rates. We have also agreed to share a portion of our proceeds that we derive from other agreements, like sublicense agreements, relating to Licensed Products that we may enter into. The percentage of such proceeds that we are required to pay Einstein ranges from the low to mid-teens, depending on how far we have developed a Licensed Product before we enter into an agreement relating to the Licensed Product. These percentages are reduced for sales of Licensed Products in countries where a competing product exists and for products or services involving the use or incorporation of technology received from Einstein relating to synapse for targeted T cell activation molecules, receptor ligand identification or platforms for T cell monitoring. In addition to our obligation to pay royalties based upon a percentage of proceeds from sales of Licensed Products, we have also agreed to pay Einstein annual maintenance fees. The maintenance payments are creditable against any royalty payments we pay under the Einstein License. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $75,000 to Einstein in license and license maintenance fees under the Einstein License.
 Under the Einstein License, we are also obligated to make milestone payments corresponding to: (i) approval of the first IND by the FDA or foreign equivalent for a Licensed Product; (ii) approval of any subsequent IND application or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (iii) initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (iv) initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (v) initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials or foreign equivalent on a Licensed Product; (vi) initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials or foreign equivalent for a “new indication” for a Licensed Product; (vii) the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product; (viii) the first commercial sale of each “new indication” for one of our previously approved Licensed Products; and (ix) cumulative sales of certain Licensed Products reaching certain threshold amounts. The aggregate amount of milestone payments made under the Einstein License may equal up to $1.85 million for each Licensed Product and up to $1.85 million for each new indication of a Licensed Product. Additionally, the aggregate amount of one-time milestone payments based on cumulative sales of all Licensed Products may equal up to $5.75 million.  As of December 31, 2020, we had paid to Einstein an aggregate amount of $150,000 in milestone payments.
 In addition to our obligations to make the cash payments to Einstein described above, under the Einstein License we issued Einstein 671,572 shares of our Common Stock immediately prior to completion of the initial public offering of our common stock completed on December 27, 2017.
 The Einstein License expires upon the expiration of our last obligation to make royalty payments to Einstein, unless terminated earlier under the provisions thereof. Under the Einstein License, we will be obligated to make royalty payments to Einstein, with respect to certain Licensed Products, for the longer of 15 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for the duration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory agency for such product and, with respect to certain Licensed Products sold by sublicensees, the longer of 10 years from the first sale of such products in each country or for so long as the sublicensee agrees to pay royalties on such products. We have the right to terminate the Einstein License at any time upon 60 days’ written notice to Einstein; provided, however, that we will lose intellectual property rights related to the Patents if we choose to terminate the Einstein License in this manner. Each party has the right to terminate the Einstein License if the other party is in default or breach of any condition of the Einstein License with a right to cure any such breach within 60 days from receipt of notice of such default or breach, unless the other party has disputed the alleged breach in good faith. Either party can also terminate the Einstein License if the other party voluntarily files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition that is not dismissed within 90 days. If we fail to pay any sum that is due and payable to Einstein within 30 days after receiving written notice of our default from Einstein, then Einstein has the option of terminating the Einstein License unless we pay within 45 days of such notice all delinquent sums with interest. 
Einstein may also terminate the Einstein License in the event we are convicted of certain felonies relating to the manufacture or use of Licensed Products.
 The Einstein License also obligates us to meet certain due diligence requirements, or the Diligence Milestones, as follows:
  
• | update our research and development plan annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------

 24


 
• | submit an IND application to the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agency within a number of years from the Effective Date;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | spend a minimum amount per year on product development until our first commercial sale of a Licensed Product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we fail to meet any of the Diligence Milestones, Einstein will have the right to terminate the Einstein License if such Diligence Milestone is not satisfied within thirty (30) days from receiving a written notice of default from Einstein. Under certain circumstances and upon prior notice to Einstein, we may have the right to an additional extension of our Diligence Milestones if, despite our commercially reasonable efforts we are not able to satisfy the Phase 2 clinical trial Diligence Milestone or any subsequent Diligence Milestone. As of the date of this report, we have met all required Diligence Milestones.
 Our Collaboration Agreement with Merck
 On November 14, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License and Research Collaboration Agreement, or the Merck Agreement, with Merck for a partnership to research and develop certain of the Company’s proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune disease indications, or the Initial Indications. We view this Merck Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. The research program outlined in the Merck Agreement entails (1) our research, discovery and development of certain Immuno-STAT drug candidates up to the point of demonstration of certain biologically relevant effects, or Proof of Mechanism, and (2) the further development by Merck of the Immuno-STAT drug product candidates that have demonstrated Proof of Mechanism, or the Proposed Drug Product Candidates, up to the point of demonstration of all or substantially all of the properties outlined in such Proposed Drug Product Candidates’ profiles as described in the Merck Agreement.
 For the purposes of this collaboration, we granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement an exclusive license under certain of our patent rights, including a sublicense of patent rights licensed from Einstein, to the extent applicable to the specific Immuno-STAT drug product candidates that are elected to be developed by Merck. In addition, so long as Merck continues product development on a Proposed Drug Product Candidate, we are restricted from conducting any development activities within the Initial Indication covered by such Proposed Drug Product Candidate other than pursuant to the Merck Agreement. 
 In exchange for the licenses and other rights granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement, we received a $2.5 million nonrefundable up-front payment and may be eligible to receive additional funding in developmental milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties if all research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones agreed upon by both parties are successfully achieved. Excluding the upfront payment described above, we are eligible to earn up to $101 million for the achievement of certain research and development milestones, $120 million for the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and $150 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestones, in addition to tiered royalties on sales, if all pre-specified milestones associated with multiple products across the primary disease indication areas are achieved. The Merck Agreement requires us to use the first $2.5 million milestone payment we receive under the agreement to fund contract research. The amount of the royalty payments is a percentage of product sales ranging in the single digits based on the amount of such sales. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $2.2 million in collaboration revenue related to this agreement.
 The term of the Merck Agreement extends until the expiration of all royalty obligations following a product candidate’s receipt of marketing authorization, at which point Merck’s licenses and sublicenses granted under the agreement shall become fully paid-up, perpetual licenses and sublicenses, as applicable. Royalties on each product subject to the Merck Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the later of: (1) the last-to-expire patent claiming the compound on which such product is based and (2) a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 25

In November 2020, we extended the research collaboration terms of this agreement through December 31, 2021 to support further development and identification of targeted biologics for the treatment of autoimmune disease.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merck may terminate the Merck Agreement at any time by providing us 30 days’ notice. The Merck Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach of its obligations thereunder and fails to cure such breach within 90 days after notice or by either party if the other party files for bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceedings.
 Our Collaboration Agreement with LG Chem
 Effective November 6, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement, or the LG Chem Agreement, with LG Chem, related to the development of Immuno-STATs focused in the field of oncology.
 Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, we granted LG Chem an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our lead product, CUE-101, as well as Immuno-STATs that target T-cells against two additional cancer antigens, or Drug Product Candidates, in Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, China (including Macau and Hong Kong) and Taiwan, which we refer to collectively as the LG Chem Territory. We retain rights to develop and commercialize all assets included in the LG Chem Agreement in the United States and in global markets outside of the LG Chem Territory. Under the LG Chem Agreement, we will engineer the selected Immuno-STATs for up to three alleles, which are expected to include the predominant alleles in the LG Chem Territory, thereby enhancing our market reach by providing for greater patient coverage of populations in global markets, while LG Chem will establish a chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, process for the development and commercialization of selected Drug Product Candidates. In addition, LG Chem has the option to select one additional Immuno-STAT for an oncology target, or an Additional Immuno-STAT, for an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license. On December 18, 2019, we and LG Chem entered into a global license and commercialization agreement, which was amended on November 5, 2020. We refer to such agreement, as amended, as the Global License and Collaboration Agreement. The Global License and Collaboration Agreement supersedes the provisions of the LG Chem Agreement related to LG Chem’s option for an Additional Immuno-STAT but generally does not become effective unless and until LG Chem exercises its option, other than certain select provisions including the length of the option period and representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. If LG Chem exercises this option, which expires on April 30, 2021, then the other provisions of the Global License and Collaboration Agreement, including the license to the Additional Immuno-STAT from us to LG Chem and the terms and conditions for such license, will become effective. We will retain an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide.  In an amendment effective November 5, 2020, we extended the time for LG Chem to exercise this option until April 30, 2021.
 Under the terms of the LG Chem Agreement, LG Chem paid us a $5.0 million non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and purchased approximately $5.0 million of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to a 20% premium to the volume weighted-average closing price per share over the 30 trading day period immediately prior to the effective date of the LG Chem Agreement. We are also eligible to receive additional aggregate payments of approximately $400 million if certain research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones are successfully achieved. In addition, the LG Chem Agreement also provides that LG Chem will pay us tiered single-digit royalties on net sales of commercialized Drug Product Candidates, or Collaboration Products, in the LG Chem Territory on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years after the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the LG Chem Agreement.
 Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, the parties will share research costs related to Collaboration Products, and LG Chem will provide CMC process development for selected Drug Product Candidates and potentially additional downstream manufacturing capabilities, including clinical and commercial supply for Collaboration Products.  In return for performing CMC process development, LG Chem is eligible to receive low-single digit percentage royalty payments on the sales of Collaboration Products sold in all countries outside the LG Chem Territory. Furthermore, should the parties enter into a Global License and Collaboration Agreement for an Additional Immuno-STAT, LG Chem will pay us a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and we will be eligible to receive up to approximately $470 to $675 million in fees and milestone payments as well as tiered royalty payments on future global sales that range from high-single digit to mid-double digit percentages in the United States and mid-single to low-double digit percentages outside of the United States.  The amount of fees and milestone payments, as well as whether we receive royalty payments, will depend on when LG Chem nominates the Additional Immuno-STAT, the number of alleles selected by LG Chem and whether we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide, in which case we would share costs and profits instead of receiving royalties and post-option-exercise milestones. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $5.5 million in collaboration revenue related to this agreement.
 26

The LG Chem Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and other customary provisions. LG Chem may terminate the LG Chem Agreement for convenience or change of control of us on a program-by-program, product-by-product or country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, at any time following the notice period set forth in the LG Chem Agreement. Either party may terminate the LG Chem Agreement, in its entirety or on a program-by-program, product-by-product or country-by-country basis, in the event of an uncured material breach. The LG Chem Agreement is also terminable by either party (i) upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the other party or (ii) for certain activities involving the challenge of certain patents controlled by the other party. Unless earlier terminated, the LG Chem Agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term.
 Our Intellectual Property
 We believe that our current patents and patent applications and any future patents and other proprietary rights that we own, or control through licensing, are and will be essential to our business. We believe that these intellectual property rights will affect our ability to compete effectively with others. We also rely and will rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for our/their intellectual property, including those patents and patent applications to which we have secured exclusive rights.
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned or had licensed fifty-two issued patents, thirty-five pending patent applications in the United States (including thirteen pending U.S. provisional patent applications), eighteen pending international PCT applications and 147 pending foreign patent applications intended to protect the intellectual property underlying our technology. Our patent applications describe certain features of our technologies, including our Immuno-STAT platform, our Neo-STAT platform, CAR-T and ex-vivo applications of our Immuno-STAT platform, as well as specific biologic molecules, drug product candidates and methods of treatment using our Immuno-STATs. We plan to spend considerable resources and focus in the future on obtaining U.S. and foreign patents. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property. No assurances can be given that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We intend to expand our international operations in the future and our patent portfolio, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 Each of our patents, if and when granted, will generally have a term of 20 years from its respective U.S. non-provisional priority filing date, subject to available extensions. They are thus set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2033 to 2040, although there can be no assurance that any of the patent applications will be granted.
 
Competition
 While we believe that our drug product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with significant competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
 Furthermore, immunotherapy technologies are advancing at a rapid pace and we anticipate competing with companies developing bi-specific antibodies attempting to deliver T cell activating cytokines, such as IL-2 (e.g., Amgen Inc., or Amgen, Immunocore Holdings plc, or Immunocore, and Roche Holding AG, or Roche), cell therapies for activating or creating cancer-relevant T cells outside the patient’s body, i.e., ex vivo, (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, and Novartis AG, or Novartis), antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., Gilead, Roche, Seagen Inc., or Seattle Genetics), immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer), and modified  cytokines, such as pegylated IL-2 for slower-release (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb/Nektar, who recently announced a combination study of BEMPEG plus KEYTRUDA in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck), as a means of reducing the unwanted collateral adverse effects of wild type IL-2, genetically-modified IL-2 for ablating the alpha subunit activity to reduce CD4 activation in favor of CD8 (e.g. Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc., or Neoleukin, Roche, and Sanofi), and antigen-specific targeting of cytokines through nanoparticles (e.g., Neximmune). [We believe that our approach provides Cue with the competitive advantage of antigen-specific targeting of cytokines, such as IL-2 by engineering proteins with a targeting moiety, i.e, peptide-MHC, coupled to genetically modified cytokines, such as not-alpha IL2 for enhancing CD8 activation and attenuated Beta-subunit for biasing the peptide-MHC/TCR affinity, thereby providing cancer antigen specificity.
 27

We expect our lead product candidate, CUE-101, will compete with other product candidates for the treatment of HPV+ cancers. While there is currently no FDA-approved therapy that specifically targets HPV for HPV+ cancers, there are multiple product candidates in clinical development, including cell therapies (e.g., Gilead and Rubius Therapeutics, Inc., or Rubius), and cancer vaccines (e.g., BioNTech SE, or BioNTech, Hookipa Pharma Inc., or Hookipa Pharma, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Inovio, and ISA B.V., or ISA Pharma). Therapies not specific to HPV are also being developed to address HPV+ cancers, including immune checkpoint inhibitors as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes by Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Iovance Biotherapeutics.
 Our corporate objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety. We expect any drug product candidate that we commercialize, either independently or with our strategic partners, will compete with existing, market-leading products.
 There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer treatment. Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities in the same therapeutic area. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in product discovery and development, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and commercialization capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.
 We believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:
  
• | design, develop and commercialize products that are superior to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy, convenience, or price;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and drug product candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | obtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Established competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our drug product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
 Government Regulation and Licensure of Products
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States
 In the United States, our candidate products would be regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations and guidances. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including non‑clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post‑approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

 
• | completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non‑clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user Prescription Drug User Free Act, or PDUFA, securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post‑approval studies required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, a product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.
 As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30‑day period, or at any time during the IND process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner.
 29

Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. 
 30

Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated check points based on certain available data from the study to which only the DSMB has access. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA, and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety Committee in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well‑controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post‑approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 31

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA.  The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Congress amended the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an application or supplement to an application.
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a “risk‑based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
 Review and Approval of a BLA
 The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of a licensed BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent.  On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of non‑clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed.
 32

The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, in 2012, Congress enacted FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 33

With passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Real-Time Oncology Review of Supplemental NDAs
 Through its Oncology Center for Excellence, or OCE, the FDA has established two pilot programs allowing for real-time review of supplemental applications for previously approved oncology products. This approach will allow FDA to evaluate clinical data as soon as the results of a clinical trial become available with the objective of reviewing and approving a new indication soon after an applicant files the application. The first of these pilot programs, Real-Time Oncology Review, or RTOR, focuses on early submission of data that are the most relevant to assessing the product’s safety and effectiveness. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data earlier, after the clinical trial results become available and the database is locked, but before the information is formally submitted to the agency.
 The FDA has established several criteria to determine whether a supplemental application may be selected for RTOR. Those criteria include whether: the investigational product is likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy; the study design is straight forward, as determined by the review division and the OCE; the endpoints can be easily interpreted.  Applications with chemistry, manufacturing and control formulation changes and supplements with pharmacology/toxicology data are excluded from RTOR. In addition, submissions with greater complexity, including those with companion diagnostics, may also be excluded for the purposes of the pilot program. On the basis of these criteria, the appropriate FDA review division and OCE management will jointly decide whether the application can be selected for the RTOR pilot program.
 34

If the FDA determines that RTOR is an appropriate review pathway, the applicant can send pre-submission data to the agency under the original application two to four weeks after all patient data have been entered and locked in the database, and the applicant is ready to request FDA approval. The package should also include key raw and derived datasets, including safety/efficacy tables and figures, study protocol and amendments, and a draft of the package insert. The applicant must also submit key results, analysis, and datasets for other disciplines, if applicable. The FDA will then evaluate these materials for sufficiency and integrity so that it can analyze the data to properly address key regulatory questions. By the time the applicant submits the application to the FDA, the review team will have completed the analysis and be familiar with the data, and can conduct a more efficient, timely, and thorough review. 
 Post‑Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post‑approval regulatory requirements as well as any post‑approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third‑party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Although health care providers may prescribe products for off-label uses in their professional judgment, drug manufacturers are prohibited from soliciting, encouraging or promoting unapproved uses of a product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 35


The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.
 36

Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent and orphan exclusivity. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an existing FDA-licensed “reference product.” As of January 1, 2021, the FDA has approved 29 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state-regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.  
 The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414.
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.

Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical Trial Approval
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.  
 The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but has not yet become effective.  As of January 1, 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The website indicated that the audit was expected to commence in December 2020. In late 2020, the EMA indicated that it plans to focus on the findings of a system audit; improving the usability, quality and stability of the clinical trial information system; and knowledge transfer to prepare users and their organizations for the new clinical trial system.  The EMA has indicated that the system will go live in December 2021.
 Parties conducting certain clinical studies must, as in the U.S., post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of drug product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of drug product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 39

Pediatric Studies
 Applicants developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s pediatric committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date.
Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
 In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 40

Patent Term Extensions in the European Union and Other Jurisdictions
 
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. These periods can be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk‑benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five‑year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
 Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post‑authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry‑sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten‑year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.
 41

Pediatric Exclusivity
 Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable by up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of drug product candidates in the UK, as the UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for drug product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. 
 General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any drug product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such drug product candidates. Even if any drug product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such drug product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such drug product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, drug product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover any drug product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such drug product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third‑party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any drug product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any drug product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low‑priced and high‑priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.

Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third‑party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti‑kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious, or fraudulent or knowingly making, using, or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil monetary penalty and false statement laws and regulations relating to pricing and submission of pricing information for government programs, including penalties for knowingly and intentionally overcharging 340b eligible entities and the submission of false or fraudulent pricing information to government entities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our drug product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit court affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the PPACA.  Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020.  On February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew DOJ’s support for this lawsuit.  A ruling by the Court is expected sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including  directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  To those ends, President Trump issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.  Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).

At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Additional Regulations
 In addition to the foregoing, state, and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling, and disposal of various biologic, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 50 full-time employees and two part-time employees. Substantially all of our employees are in Cambridge, Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and other third parties to assist with various aspects of our drug and product development.
 We recognize the value of our employees and are committed to being a workplace that encourages respect, collaboration, communication, transparency, and integrity. We seek to hire employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our success starts and ends with having the best talent, and as a result, we are focused on attracting, developing and retaining our employees. We offer employees a competitive and comprehensive benefits package. We support employees attending industry conferences and obtaining professional licenses.  We use a variety of human capital measures in managing our business, including: workforce demographics; inclusion and diversity; and employee health and safety.
 We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. During 2020, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety protocols intended to help minimize the risk of virus transmission to our employees, including  the establishment of remote working standards, pausing all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and limiting employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, to the extent those events and meetings are continuing.
 Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until. private companies (i.e., those that have not had a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) are required to comply with such new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. Even though we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period, we may still take advantage of all of the other provisions of the JOBS Act, which include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
