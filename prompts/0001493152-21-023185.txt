Company Background – Business Overview
 
We were originally incorporated as “Nova Mining Corporation” in Nevada on December 29, 2005. After a change in control the Company changed its name to “The Radiant Creations Group, Inc.” and we were focused on developing and marketing a skin crème and other cosmetic and over-the-counter personal enhancement products and devices.
 
On July 11, 2018, we closed our Subscription and Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with three investors, Carlsbad Naturals, LLC, Ray Grimm, and Nish Mehta. Under the SPA, the investors were issued a (collectively) controlling interest in the Company consisting of a total of 9,695,328 shares of common stock. These shares were issued in exchange for a total Purchase Price of $95,000. The Purchase Price was used to settle and retire our notes payable, for certain compliance costs, and for general working capital. In conjunction with the SPA, our formerly controlling stockholder, Biodynamic Molecular Technologies, LLC, exchanged its preferred stock for a total of 269,315 shares of common stock. Upon issue, these shares were transferred to principal of Biodynamic Molecular Technologies, LLC, Michael Alexander. This common stock position, which represented 2.5% of our post-closing common stock, was formerly non-dilutable for a period of one (1) year. We acquired New You LLC following the passage of the United States Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, commonly known as the “Farm Bill,” which contained a permanent declassification of cannabidiol (CBD) as a controlled substance under federal law. As a result of that transaction, we own and operate the CBD brand New You LLC which now represents our focus and all of our revenues.
 
On March 8, 2019, pursuant to stockholder consent, our Board of Directors authorized an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to (i) change the name of the Company from The Radiant Creations Group, Inc. to New You, Inc. and (ii) effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.00001, on a 1 for 50 basis (the “Reverse Stock Split”). We filed the Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State reflecting the name change on March 27, 2019. On April 29, 2019, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. notified us that the Name Change and Reverse Stock Split would take effect on April 30, 2019 (the “Effective Date”). On the Effective Date, each holder of common stock received 1 share of our common stock for each 50 shares of our common stock they owned immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split. We did not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share. In addition, on the Effective Date the Company’s trading symbol changed to “RCGPD” for a period of 20 business days, after which the “D” was removed from the Company’s trading symbol and began trading under new trading symbol “NWYU.” Unless otherwise indicated, the information in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements gives effect to the 1-for-50 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share and name change from The Radiant Creations Group, Inc. to New You, Inc., effected on April 30, 2019.

New You, Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiary, New You LLC, markets and sells its products through a multi-level marketing and direct sales opportunity afforded to independent business owners called “Brand Partners.” Commissions are earned on product sales to Brand Partners and their customers at a rate of 10% for every transaction, plus a specified spread on recurring sales. Brand Partners earn a 5% commission on sales by other team members at lower levels up to nine level below the Brand Partner. Brand Partners can earn an additional bonus for customer sales and team sales. The team bonus is $400 for each time the team bonus volume reaches a certain amount in a 30 day period. Brand Partners can also earn an initial bonus of 20% of the transaction value for qualifying Brand Partners in the Brand Partner’s first 30 days. There is a risk that Brand Partners may find it difficult to sell in a network marketing environment. Brand Partners may also find it difficult to sell CBD related products due to the uncertainty surrounding FDA regulations of CBD and hemp related products. Lastly, public perception of CBD products may be negative, as such products are derived from the Hemp plant. The Company does not hold any patents or trademarks and, as a result, may be vulnerable to competition from other companies offering very similar products and product brands The Company purchases inventory from Carlsbad Naturals, LLC. Carlsbad Naturals, LLC is a principal stockholder of New You, Inc., and is owned by a principal stockholder of New You, Inc. As a result, we are dependent on a related party for product inventory and do not have a broad base of unaffiliated suppliers. The officers and directors of the Company own 43.81% of the outstanding common shares. Accordingly, management will have a determinative influence on matters requiring stockholder approval.
 
We conduct our principal operations through one operating subsidiary, New You LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $5,046,711 and $1,692,298, respectively. The Company will need to raise additional capital to fund operations based on the current level of sales. We can provide no assurance that the required additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.

Once a customer or Brand Partner places an order, our warehouse staff will receive that order and fulfill that order on the same day or within one business day.

Competition
 
The market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, in the United States, New You LLC does not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. Our competitors in the sales of CBD-based products include cbdMD, Green Roads, PlusCBD, and Select CBD, Diamond CBD, CBDistillery, and Lazarus Naturals. We have no known competitors in the multi-level marketing space. We believe we compete based upon the quality of our products. We expect that the quantity and composition of the competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures and new customers enter the marketplace.
Regulatory Requirements and Government Regulations
 
On December 20, 2018 the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it is no longer an illegal substance under federal law. For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been legalized at the federal level and this paved the way for the growth of the industry. With the recent publication of the USDA interim final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program on October 31, 2019, hemp can now be grown and processed legally in the United States, and is legal to transport in interstate commerce. Although this interim final rule became effective on the date of publication, it is still subject to comment and there is a possibility it will be modified from its current application.
 
The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
 
In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.
 
This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill. Recently, both the U.S. House of Representatives (McNerney CA-09) and the Senate (McConnell R-KY) have passed amendments to the respective appropriations bills working their way through each chamber, which would help clear the way for cannabidiol (CBD) to become an approved dietary ingredient by the FDA through an alternative rule making process available to the FDA. Although it is uncertain if either of these amendments will make it to the final federal appropriation bill, or if the President will ultimately sign the appropriations bill, this signifies the legislatures clear intent to pave a pathway for clear and consistent federal regulation for cannabidiol.
 
As of the date of this report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD.
 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security. There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 5 full-time employees and 2 part-time warehouse employees.
