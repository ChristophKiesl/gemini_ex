Business Overview
 
Veritas Farms, Inc. (“Veritas Farms”) is a vertically-integrated agribusiness focused on producing, marketing, and distributing superior quality, whole plant, full spectrum hemp oils and extracts containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids. Veritas Farms™ owns and operates a 140 acre farm in Pueblo, Colorado, capable of producing over 200,000 proprietary full spectrum hemp plants containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids which can potentially yield a minimum annual harvest of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds of outdoor-grown industrial hemp. While part of the cannabis family, hemp, which contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” in marijuana, is distinguished from marijuana by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration (marijuana generally has a THC level of 10% or more). The Company also operates approximately 15,000 square feet of climate-controlled greenhouses to produce a consistent supply of year-round indoor-cultivated hemp. In addition, there is a 10,000 square foot onsite facility used for processing raw hemp, oil extraction, formulation laboratories and quality/purity testing. Veritas Farms is registered with the Colorado Department of Agriculture to grow industrial hemp and with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to process hemp and manufacture hemp products in accordance with Colorado’s hemp program.
 
Veritas Farms meticulously processes its hemp crop to produce superior quality whole-plant hemp oil, extracts and derivatives which contain the entire broad spectrum of cannabinoids extracted from the flowers and leaves of hemp plants. Whole-plant hemp oil is known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire broad spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system. As a result, Veritas Farms believes that its products are premier quality cannabinoids and are highly sought after by consumers and manufacturers.
 
Veritas Farms has developed a wide variety of formulated phytocannabinoid-rich hemp products containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids which are marketed and distributed by the Company under its Veritas Farms™ brand name. Our products are also available in bulk, white label and private label custom formulations for distributors and retailers. These types of products are in high demand by health food markets, wellness centers, physicians and other healthcare practitioners.
 
Veritas Farms products (70+ SKUs) include vegan capsules, gummies, tinctures, lotions, salves, cream and oral syringes. All product applications come in various flavors and strength formulations, in addition to bulk. Many of the Company’s whole-plant hemp oil products and formulations are available for purchase online directly from the Company through its website, www.TheVeritasFarms.com, as well as through numerous other online retailers and “brick and mortar” retail outlets.
 
The branding of Company’s line of hemp oil and extract product has allowed for market penetration during 2020 into large retail chains vastly increasing brand exposure and awareness. The initial rollouts have been successful creating distribution opportunities into thousands of new retail outlets across the country (over 8,000 retail outlets as of December 31, 2020). The shift from smaller order fulfillment to larger “big box store” orders creates an economy of scale and also offers the opportunity for the Company to achieve increased profitability.

Effects of the Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
 
General
 
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, have and could continue to adversely affect the Company’s suppliers and logistics. In addition, stay at home orders, quarantines, delayed mass vaccinations, the closure of “brick and mortar” retail outlets and other restrictions have altered the normal purchasing patterns of consumers. More broadly, the high degree of unemployment resulting from the pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services, resulting in continued economic stress to our business, operations and financial condition. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company. While reports show an increase in retail sales, the retail sales for CBD products continue to decline.
Increased Emphasis on E-commerce Marketing
 
With recent stay-at-home mandates arising from the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in increased online traffic, Veritas Farms has leveraged its digital ecosystem to offer solutions to customers who have financial and health concerns while growing the Company’s online traffic and revenue.
 
The increased emphasis on e-commerce marketing has resulted in online revenue growth of over 96% from 2019 to 2020. The increases in traffic to and revenue generated by the Veritas Farms website can be attributed to a multi-prong digital strategy leveraging multiple channels. The extended reach and increased frequency of exposure to the Veritas Farms product lines’ across these channels, combined with a seamless shopping experience, superior product and excellent customer service lead to repeat customer growth.
 
A comparison of revenue-driving channels for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 shows:
 

● | Overall eCommerce revenue increased by 96% 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veritas Farms is committed to the research and development of improved proprietary hemp genetics cultivation and innovation in order to provide the global community with uncompromised quality hemp products, containing the highest quality, quantity and consistency in the industry.
 
Our commitment to enhancing the symbiotic relationship between healthy plants and healthy people ensures that we provide whole plant, broad spectrum cannabinoid-rich hemp products while using only natural protocols and sustainable farming methods.
 
Our philosophy is to practice strict natural protocols for hemp cultivation and utilize the latest technology to assist our sustainable, environmentally sound farming practices to ensure pure, pesticide free, and high-quality consistent products.
 
Why Cannabinoids? 
 
Cannabinoid-rich hemp oil is made from the stalks and leaves of the cannabis sativa plant. Like THC, cannabinoid-rich hemp is an active cannabinoid found in cannabis plants. Unlike THC, however, cannabinoid-rich hemp has no psychoactive properties and its health benefits may be even more profound than those of THC.
 
What are cannabinoids? They are chemical compounds secreted by the flowers of the cannabis plant. Our brains have receptors that respond pharmacologically to them. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid, which binds to receptors in the brain, while cannabinoid-rich hemp binds to receptors throughout the body. Whole-plant hemp extracts are known to provide the essential phytocannabinoid “entourage effect” resulting from the synergistic absorption of the entire broad spectrum of unique hemp cannabinoids by the receptors of the human endocannabinoid system.
 
Through our body’s endocannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid-rich hemp can mitigate both pain, swelling and inflammation associated with it. Science has long known about cannabinoid’s analgesic properties, which is why we now have a number of cannabinoid-rich hemp-infused topical creams and salves designed for direct application to skin.
 
There seems to be no end to the painful conditions for which cannabinoid-rich hemp could mean a measure of localized relief. Enthusiasts commonly cite arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, and even plain old muscle soreness or the itchiness from psoriasis and dermatitis as potential targets for the cannabis compound.
 
Current Industry Factors
 
Typical Cannabinoid Company Profile. The majority of cannabinoid companies are either farmers/extractors, manufacturers, or retail brands. Farmers often grow and extract their oil, sometimes selling their oil wholesale to product manufacturers and sometimes manufacturing their own products and then selling them in bulk to brands that use them for private label products. Retail brands are forced into a state of constant supply search and often have to order from multiple farmers/extractors in order to ensure their demand is met. This can cause inconsistency in product potency and quality, often leading to products that do not have an accurate Certificate of Analysis or additional contaminate tests.
Poor Quality Products, Morally Questionable Companies. As with any burgeoning new market, opportunistic entrepreneurs and entities have surfaced selling inferior products that are often misrepresented and mislabeled. These products may contain little to no active cannabinoid compounds, or contaminated cannabinoid compounds. These entities often seek a quick payday for the company’s founders and take advantage of the lack of consumer education about the industry.
 
Lack of Consumer Knowledge/Confusion in Market Place. New markets and products are often rife with miseducation and misunderstanding. Cannabinoid products are just beginning to be absorbed by the mainstream public, who may be unaware of the implications of the lack of quality control, proper application, dosing and uses.

Our goal is to secure as large a share of the growing market for cannabinoid products as possible, by taking advantage of the fractured nature of the industry, the poor quality products offered by some competitors and the lack of knowledge of the potential benefits of cannabinoid by means of:
 

● | Offering only the highest quality products by maintaining control of the growing, extracting and manufacturing processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing a one-stop vertically integrated source for cannabinoid products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing demand by educating consumers on the potential benefits of use of cannabinoid products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employing an integrated marketing plan across both traditional and digital channels.

Production
 
Hemp growth, extraction, processing, formulation and product manufacturing takes place at our facilities located on our 140-acre farm in Pueblo Colorado. Our farm is capable of producing over 200,000 plants potentially yielding a minimum annual harvest of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds of outdoor grown hemp.
 
In addition, the Company’s 15,000 square feet of climate-controlled greenhouses are capable of producing a consistent supply of approximately 25,000 pounds per year of indoor cultivated hemp over 4-6 individual harvests.
 
There is an additional 10,000 square foot on-site facility used for plant processing and oil extraction, in addition to housing Veritas Farms’ testing and formulation laboratories, wherein GMP (good manufacturing practices) are strictly maintained.
 
The production process starts in the ground, with our cultivation team. Veritas Farms is fortunate to have a team of dedicated, experienced, and passionate farming experts that nurture our plants with individual care, much like the care and attention paid to vines in a vineyard.
 
After harvest, our in-house laboratory chemists and extraction technicians produce varieties of high quality, pure hemp derivative oils while constantly finding methods to improve processes and improve our products.
 
Veritas Farms uses advanced, strict natural protocols to cultivate its cannabinoid-rich hemp oil yield from its plants. After naturally air drying, only the leaves and flowers richly coated with trichomes are processed with our advanced ethanol spray evaporation extractors according to the planned uses for the cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts. Whole plant full spectrum cannabinoid-rich hemp extracts are then further processed using chromatography and other techniques yielding pure distillates and other derivatives exceeding 80% cannabinoid-rich hemp with 0.3% or less THC.

As part of the Company’s increased focus on sales and marketing, Veritas Farms launched a line of products under its own proprietary brand, Veritas Farms, including hemp oil and extract products. The Veritas Farms brand line, including new packaging, was developed to expand the Company’s potential customer base. The Veritas Farms product line is expected to continually expand to offer additional products and applications.
 
Currently, Veritas Farms has implemented a marketing plan to compete in the Cannabinoid industry. To become a market leader in the industry, the Company plans to use three primary channels to market its products, web-based marketing, traditional marketing and medical marketing.
 
Web-Based Marketing
 
General. Veritas Farms’ expanded e-commerce retail platform is designed to offer for sale the Company’s premium phytocannabinoid-rich extract products directly to consumers under the Veritas Farms brand. The site gives us the ability to quickly adapt to a rapidly evolving market and to position our branded product lines as a leader in the industry. In addition to our e-commerce platform, Veritas Farms is pursuing distribution with leading third-party online retailers. As described above in “Effects of the Current Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic on the Company – Increased Emphasis on E-commerce Marketing,” the current Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant increases in the Company’s e-commerce marketing efforts, resulting in e-commerce revenue growth.
Content Marketing via Blogs and Social Media. We believe that content marketing offers a cost-effective marketing strategy. The core components to Veritas Farms’ content marketing strategy are blogs and social media posts. Veritas Farms has partnered with TFC Marketing to establish a market leader presence surrounding the cannabinoid industry, using blogging which has a strong impact on return on investment. Veritas Farms launched an engaging social media campaign to promote an overall vision of quality and transparent phytocannabinoid products.
Influencer Campaigns. Influencer marketing is a type of marketing that focuses on using online leaders to drive the brand’s message to the larger market. Rather than market directly to a large group of consumers, Veritas Farms will partner with influencers to utilize their personal social channels to spread the word about the brand. Influencers are celebrities, high-quality content creators, buzz builders and promoters and natural health advocates. Extensive tracking methods will be implemented to determine the effectiveness of the influencer campaigns.
Search Engine Optimization, (“SEO”). SEO is important for establishing and creating an online presence. Most single online interaction starts with key words manually entered into a search engine, in relevant website options for the user. The Veritas Farms SEO marketing plan contemplates a monthly campaign to ensure the website ranks in top relevance for industry-related searches on major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo.

Government Regulation
 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to:
 

● | The production of our products
--+-------------------------------


● | Environmental protection
--+-------------------------


● | Interstate commerce and taxation
--+---------------------------------


● | Workplace and safety conditions, minimum wage and other labor requirements
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The federal Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, signed into law on December 20, 2019, along with the Agricultural Act of 2014, the corresponding Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 provisions (as extended by resolution into 2019) and Colorado’s Industrial Hemp Regulatory Program and related state law, permit the cultivation of hemp, and the processing and manufacturing of hemp products, as part of agricultural pilot programs and/or state plans adopted by individual states, including Colorado (pursuant to which we operate). However, there can be no assurance that new legislation or regulations may be introduced at either the federal and/or state level which, if passed, would impose new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation, elimination or relabeling of certain products to meet new standards and revisions to certain sales and marketing materials and it is possible that the costs of complying with these new regulatory requirements could be material.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and their state-level equivalents, possess broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal and state law, respectively, applicable to consumer products. These regulations provide consumer safeguards for foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, and give the power to these agencies to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain illegal products intended for import or export (in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection), require a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice, or the state-level equivalent, to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in federal. or state courts. The initiation of any regulatory action towards industrial hemp or hemp derivatives by the FDA, FTC or any other related federal or state agency, could result in greater legal cost to Veritas Farms, may result in substantial financial penalties and enjoinment from certain business-related activities, and if such actions were publicly reported, they may have a materially adverse effect on the Company, its business and its results of operations.
Competition
 
The industrial hemp cultivation and derivative products industry is relatively new and evolving. While we believe that the industry is fragmented at the present time, there are numerous competitors, including Green Roads, Charlotte’s Web, Folium Biosciences, CBD Rx. St. Mary’s Nutritional and CV Sciences, some of whom may be larger and have a longer operating history and greater financial resources than does the Company. Moreover, we may also face competition with larger firms in the consumer products manufacturing and distribution industry, who elect to enter the market given the relatively low barriers to entry. Veritas Farms believes that it competes effectively with these companies because of its vertical integration through the cultivation, extraction, formulation, manufacturing and distribution processes, the quality of its products and customer service. However, no assurance can be given that Veritas Farms will effectively compete with its existing or future competitors.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 45 full-time employees including our executive officers, 13 of whom are based in Florida, Georgia and California and 32 of whom are based in Colorado. The Company employs up to an additional 15-20 employees in Colorado during the outdoor harvest season.
