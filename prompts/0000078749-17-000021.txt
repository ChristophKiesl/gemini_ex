History and Significant Events
Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt, fund growth of our enterprise solutions business and acquire businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc.
In fiscal 2004, we acquired Kyrus Corporation and became a provider of IBM retail solutions and services in the supermarket, chain drug, general retail, and hospitality segments. In that same year, the acquisition of Inter-American Data, Inc. allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for property and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.
In calendar 2007, we divested KeyLink Systems and exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis and Visual One Systems Corp. in calendar 2007, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class, POS and software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort, and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2008, we began reporting three primary operating segments: Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG), Retail Solutions Group (RSG) and Technology Solutions Group (TSG).
In fiscal 2012, we sold our TSG segment and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our operating units.
On July 3, 2014 we purchased certain assets from Dining Ventures, Inc. The acquired assets are the base for our rGuest® Seat product, a dining reservations and table management application.

On July 1, 2013, we completed the sale of our RSG business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market.
On March 31, 2014, we completed the sale of our United Kingdom business entity (UK entity) to Verteda Limited (Verteda), led by the Company’s former European management team. In connection with the sale, we have entered into a multi-year distribution agreement, whereby Verteda distributes certain Agilysys products within the U.K. marketplace. We continue to manage all property management system accounts as well as key global accounts in the EMEA market.
Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their respective brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying intuitive solutions that increase speed and accuracy, thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the customer relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, software as a subscription services, cloud applications and professional services.

Products: 
The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating an end-to-end business, but the technology vendors that serviced the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. We have evolved our approach to the industry to an integrated "platform" centric solutions for Lodging, Food & Beverage and Payments applications that looks to leverage the entire business, by investing in the development of a web services oriented architecture enterprise platform. Our rGuest™ platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests, pre-, during and post-visit. The rGuest platform facilitates an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve guest services, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our next-generation of products and services are aimed at helping hospitality operators recruit customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each customer and improve the overall guest experience from the initial customer touch point through the post-visit experience.

The rGuest platform underlies our industry leading hospitality solutions that are being introduced to operators of all sizes and with varying needs. The rGuest platform is designed to run as a Software as a Service (“SaaS”)-based platform on the public cloud, private cloud, on-premise, or in a hybrid configuration where the infrastructure may be above premise but the data resides on premise. rGuest’s architecture seamlessly functions as well for a multi-property customer as it does for a single property. 
The rGuest enterprise platform helps operators more efficiently manage their business and grow their sales by:

• | Identifying the right data and determining how to best use it;

Industry and Markets
We offer innovative point-of-sale, property management, inventory and procurement, workforce management, analytics, document management and mobile and wireless solutions and services for customers of varying sizes in the hospitality industry. We serve 
four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare.
The hospitality industry encompasses a wide variety of market sectors and customers. We operate throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA. Sales to customers outside of the United States represent approximately 6% of total sales.
The hospitality industry is highly fragmented and composed of a number of defined markets including lodging, casinos, cruise ships, resorts and spas, franchise operators, restaurant chains, stadiums, and arenas, among others. For example, in the lodging segment, no single hotel brand accounts for more than 4% of all hotel rooms in the United States. According to STR Global, the U.S. lodging industry generated approximately $189.5 billion in lodging revenue in calendar 2015, a 7.2% increase over 2014, while PwC's, Hospitality Directions US 2017, reports an average of approximately 65.5% of approximately 5.0 million available rooms occupied in 2016 at an average daily rate (ADR) of $124.01. This compares with 65.4% in 2015 at an ADR of $120.31. 
The hospitality business is sensitive to the strength of domestic and global economic and credit conditions. Business and destination resort travel are highly correlated with the economic conditions in their respective markets. Competition is intense for consumer spending, and hospitality industry participants are seeking ways to increase their visibility and appeal as well as enhance the experience of their guests. In its 2017 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook, Deloitte observed that travel companies should leverage an increased awareness of customer expectations, re-imagined technology strategy, and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences. Our products and solutions are meant to leverage the opportunity these challenges create by providing our customers with a higher degree of guest connectivity and added engagement tools that will enable them to better capitalize on their brand equity, and more profitably manage their operations, and grow their business. In addition to product solutions that are designed and customized to meet unique facility or multi-facility needs, we also provide an array of support and subscription options geared towards maintaining systems and professional services for implementation and rollouts.
We have a significant customer base in the commercial casino and gaming sector. According to CPA firm Rubin Brown's Gaming Services Group, US Gaming industry annual revenues surpassed $73 billion in 2016, as compared to approximately $71 billion in 2015. Amenities in contemporary casinos extend well beyond gaming to include a variety of entertainment and leisure options as well as modern convention centers and meeting facilities to attract the corporate market. International gaming markets are growing rapidly both in size and new jurisdictions. Asian gaming markets continue to generate robust growth. Gross gaming revenue in Macau exceeds that of the Las Vegas Strip, with a number of the current and planned properties in the region operated by U.S.-based companies. As the market share leader in providing PMS systems to casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, we are well positioned to benefit from these strong and long-standing relationships as our customer base expands into international markets. Additionally, as gaming operators 
11

migrate toward cashless operations, optimization of non-gaming spend and digital track-and-log of unique guest behavior, we are able to provide the requisite technologies and expertise to satisfy their needs.
We also have expertise in serving the unique needs of Cruise ship operators. Guests and potential customers are expecting an experience that reflects their unique tastes, preferences and travel habits and cruise operators have seen the need to adequately support the increasing level of personalization and detail required to capture the highest level of guest satisfaction. Our products and services are designed to best help them deliver on this critical part of their business. According to the Cruise Lines International Association and Cruise Market Watch 2017, cruise lines continued the growth trends of recent years in 2016. The worldwide cruise ship fleet currently stands at 448 ships and the current order book for 2016 includes 26 new builds, with 97 new ships to be delivered by 2026. The industry carried an estimated 24.2 million passengers in 2016, up from nearly 23.2 million passengers in 2015.
Customers
Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique companies, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important, particularly in the lodging, casino, destination resort, cruise line, foodservice industries where competition for guest recruitment is intense. Our current customer base is highly fragmented, with the exception of one customer representing approximately 10% of consolidated revenue from continuing operations for the period ended March 31, 2017.
Seasonality
We have traditionally experienced seasonal revenue weakness during our fiscal first quarter ending June 30. Additionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, occasionally creates volatility in our quarterly results.
Competition
Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. 
We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc. and Infor. We also compete with software companies like IDeaS Revenue Solutions, POSitouch, Northwind and Xpient Solutions. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.
Environmental Matters
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. 
Employees
As of May 24, 2017, we had 596 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
