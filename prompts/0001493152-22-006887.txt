Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Millennium Sustainable Ventures Corp., formerly known as Millennium Investment & Acquisition Co. Inc., formerly known as Millennium India Acquisition Company, Inc. (“MILC”, “we”, “our”, the “Company”) currently has two business focuses: (i) sustainable cultivation of cannabis in greenhouses, and (ii) sustainable production of activated carbon.
 
Millennium Cannabis LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, is focused on a sustainable approach to cannabis cultivation through Controlled Environmental Agriculture (“CEA”) in the form of greenhouses, with current operations in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Michigan.
 
Millennium Carbon, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary that has developed a novel method for the sustainable production of activated carbon and has constructed a proof-of-concept pilot-scale plant in Kentucky to produce activated carbon from a waste stream generated by Bourbon distilleries. MILC is evaluating the construction of a commercial scale plant based on the technology it has developed.
 
Deregistration as a 1940 Act Company and Name Change
 
During 2020, MILC announced that it was seeking to de-register as an Investment Company that is regulated under Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). As previously announced, MILC has completed the liquidation of its sole investment in securities - its investment in SMC Global Securities Limited and plans to invest the proceeds in operating businesses. On October 14, 2020, shareholders approved a proposal to change the nature of the Company’s business from a registered investment company under the 1940 Act to a holding company that focuses primarily on owning and operating businesses (collectively, the “Deregistration Proposal”). On March 1, 2021, as amended on May 11, 2021, December 9, 2021 and January 21, 2022, the Company filed an application pursuant Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for an Order Declaring that MILC has Ceased to be an Investment Company (the “Deregistration Order”). On February 2, 2022, the SEC issued a notice that it was commencing the 25-day public review period in response to MILC’s application. On February 28, 2022, MILC received the Deregistration Order declaring that is has ceased to be an Investment Company. Consequently, the financial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
On October 1, 2021, MILC filed an application with FINRA for approval to change its name to Millennium Sustainable Ventures Corp. MILC received approval for the name change effective February 11, 2022 as disclosed in a Form 8-K and Press Release issued on February 16, 2022. We believe the name change better reflects our focus on sustainable Controlled Environment Agriculture cultivation in greenhouses and the sustainable production of activated carbon. MILC, with a focus on the “Triple Bottom Line” and a commitment to Profit, Planet and People is focused on sustainable business practices.
 
Corporate Structure
 
MILC has seven subsidiaries. Millennium Cannabis LLC (“MillCann”), Millennium HI Carbon LLC (“MHC”), Millennium Carbon LLC, (“MillCarbon”) and Millennium HR LLC (“MILCHR”) are wholly owned. VinCann LLC (“VC”) and Marengo Cannabis LLC (“MarCann”) are owned by MillCann and operate our cannabis cultivation operations in Oklahoma and Michigan respectively. Walsenburg Cannabis LLC (“WC”) is currently owned by a third party; however, is considered a variable interest entity of MillCann because MillCann, due to the loan it has made to WC, is deemed to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb financial losses of the entity and right to receive benefits from the entity. See Note 2 to the Notes to Financial Statements “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -Variable Interest Entities.” MillCann will own 82.0% and 100% equity ownership of VC and MarCann, respectively, and after conversion of the convertible note of WC will own 83.5% of WC.

Colorado
 
On May 24, 2021, MILC announced that the Company entered a new area of focus related to sustainable cannabis cultivation in greenhouses by investing in a newly formed cannabis operator, Walsenburg Cannabis LLC (“WC”) WC leases a 22.2-acre property in Walsenburg, CO. Upon completion of improvements, the site will have approximately 102,000 square feet of greenhouse and related space. The Walsenburg facility was a distressed acquisition that had ceased operations. We commenced the rehabilitation of the property in May 2021, and it is now operational. During 2021, WC harvested and processed our first crops and sales are underway.
 
As part of the transaction, MillCann issued capital to WC in the form of a convertible loan for its business operations and MILC is in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for holding cannabis licenses in Colorado. As of December 31, 2021, MillCann has advanced $1,548,637 pursuant to the loan. Upon receiving regulatory approval which had not yet occurred as of December 31, 2021, it is contemplated that the loan will convert into a preferred equity interest in WC that receives a full return of invested capital plus a 12.5% preferred return after which MillCann has an 83.5% ownership stake. The remaining subordinated ownership will be held by the management of WC. Simultaneous with MillCann’s investment, WC entered into a 20-year lease (the “WC Lease”) on an approximately 22.2-acre property including existing greenhouse and processing space in Walsenburg, Colorado (the “WC Property”). As part of the WC Lease, the lessor, a wholly owned subsidiary of Power REIT (Ticker: PW and PW.PRA), which is a company that David Lesser our Chief Executive Officer is also the Chief Executive Officer, agreed to fund the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing improvements and the construction of additional greenhouse space. Upon completion, the WC Property will have a total of approximately 102,800 square feet of greenhouse and related space. The Walsenburg cannabis campus was a distressed acquisition of a facility that had ceased operations. MILC believes that it was acquired at an attractive basis relative to the in-place improvements which provided an attractive opportunity to immediately commercialize the facility for cannabis cultivation. MILC believes that this WC Property has potential to become a large-scale, low-cost producer of high-quality cannabis to compete effectively in the Colorado market. The campus is subdivided into five parcels which allows for a significant availability of plant count based on how the Colorado Marijuana licensing works.
 
Oklahoma
 
MillCann currently operates a 9.35-acre property in Vinita, OK through VinCann LLC (“VC”). The site features 40,000 square feet of greenhouse and related space and approximately 100,000 square foot outdoor growing area. The Vinita facility was a distressed property operated by an undercapitalized operator. We commenced the rehabilitation of the property in June, 2021, and are now fully operational. During 2021, we harvested and processed our first crops and sales will begin in the first quarter of 2022.
 
MillCann has invested $1,308,293 in VC through a preferred equity interest that receives a full return of invested capital plus a 12.5% preferred return after which MillCann will have an 82.0% ownership stake. The remaining subordinated ownership will be held by the management team of VC. Concurrent with MillCann’s investment, VC entered into a 20-year lease (the “VC Lease”) for a 9.35-acre plot of land in Vinita, Oklahoma with approximately 40,000 square feet of greenhouse, 3,000 square feet of office space, and 100,000 square feet of fully fenced outdoor growing area with 20,000+ square feet of hoop structures (the “VC Property”). As part of the VC Lease, the lessor, a wholly owned subsidiary of Power REIT (Ticker: PW and PW.PRA), agreed to fund the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing improvements. The Vinita facility was a distressed acquisition purchased from an undercapitalized operator. MILC believes that it was acquired at an attractive basis relative to the in-place improvements which provided an attractive opportunity to immediately commercialize the facility for cannabis cultivation.
 
Michigan
 
On September 9, 2021, MILC announced the expansion of its sustainable cannabis cultivation activities by establishing operations in Michigan. A new wholly owned subsidiary of MillCann, Marengo Cannabis LLC (“MarCann”), was created and entered into a 20-year lease (the “MarCann Lease) for approximately 12 acres that includes a 556,416 square foot state-of-the-art greenhouse cultivation facility which is located in Marengo County, Michigan (the “MC Property”). MILC has invested $1,302,711 in this property and believes it is the largest cannabis cultivation facility in Michigan. As part of the Lease, the Lessor, a wholly owned subsidiary of Power REIT (ticker: PW and PW.PRA), has agreed to fund the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing improvements.

The Michigan facility was a distressed acquisition that was vacant at the time of acquisition. MILC believes that it was acquired at an attractive basis relative to the in-place improvements which provide an attractive opportunity to commercialize the facility for cannabis cultivation. MILC believes that this property has the potential to become a large-scale, low-cost producer of high-quality cannabis to compete effectively in the Michigan market.
 
We are in the process of making modifications to the property for cannabis cultivation and continue to work on local and state approvals and licenses and expect to be in a position to commence operations once all approvals are obtained.
 
Activated Carbon
 
In September 2014, Millennium HI Carbon, LLC (“MHC”) was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of MILC in the state of Hawaii for the purpose of acquiring an activated carbon plant located near the port of Kawaihae, Hawaii (the “Plant”). The acquisition, which was completed in May 2015, consisted of the existing equipment which is located on 13 acres of land leased from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.
 
Despite commencing operations in 2011, the Plant failed to achieve full commercial operations. It ceased operations in 2012 and its owner filed for bankruptcy protection. Prior to shutting down, the plant produced activated carbon but there were a number of design and operational issues that needed resolution in order to produce premium-grade activated carbon and operate the plant on a full-time basis.
 
The Plant was intended to process a waste stream of macadamia nut shells into a special form of premium-grade Activated Carbon, which, due to its large surface area and complex network of pores, provides benefits in a variety of chemical processes including filtration, purification and energy storage. In particular, the Activated Carbon expected to be produced by the Plant was targeted for manufacturing electrical double-layer capacitors, which are commonly referred to as ultracapacitors or supercapacitors, an advanced energy storage alternative to traditional batteries. Ultracapacitors are found in a diverse array of electronic equipment from daily usage engine starting, hybrid and electric vehicles to windmills.
 
MHC successfully restored all production equipment and necessary support systems to operation and MHC completed 31 trial run campaigns that produced over 60 tons of Activated Carbon. The process was iterative where MHC operated the Plant for a couple of days to produce Activated Carbon and then performed laboratory testing. MHC produced some very high-grade material that would be attractive to ultracapacitor manufacturers. Unfortunately, MHC has also experienced significant variations in the quality of the material produced which is not commercially viable.
 
During the first half of 2019, MHC concluded that the existing carbonization reactor intended to remove volatile material and produce char was causing the inconsistent results. In evaluating alternatives, MHC identified a novel and potentially better approach to producing Activated Carbon. Based on this, MILC has made efforts to minimize overhead and cash drain while it seeks a strategic alternative for the Hawaii Plant. Effective December 31, 2021, MILC determined to write off the remaining value of the HI asset for accounting purposes given that the plant is dormant and there is uncertainty around a business plan for this asset. Impairment of $2,765,000 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 to account for the full write off of the asset. MHC is not current with respect to its obligations contained in the ground lease for the MHC property on which the plant is located. As of December 31, 2021, MHC has a payable outstanding to the ground lessor, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, of approximately $1,165,000. MHC has also entered into a secured demand note with MILC (“Lender”) with an interest rate of 8% which is repayable upon demand by the Lender. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of the loan outstanding is approximately $3,073,600 with accrued interest of $445,070.

In evaluating operational issues at MHC, as described above, MILC identified a novel approach to producing Activated Carbon and determined to construct a pilot-plant as a proof of concept. This project is located in Kentucky and the initial feedstock is stillage which is a waste stream that is available in large quantities from bourbon distilleries which is a large industry in Kentucky and which represents a significant waste problem that is impacting the bourbon industry. To build the pilot plant, MILC, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Millennium Carbon LLC (“MillCarbon”) purchased several used pieces of equipment at a fraction of the cost of new equipment in order to construct a plant capable of establishing the viability of the process beyond a “lab-scale” demonstration. To date, MillCarbon has operated this pilot plant and believes that the concept is valid and can be scaled to a commercial operation. MillCarbon is currently formulating a plan for a commercial scale Activated Carbon plant based on the experience with the pilot plant.
 
Technical Strategy
 
Cannabis
 
MILC has identified greenhouse cultivation as the sustainable method for growing cannabis in a cost-effective manner with a lower carbon footprint than indoor cultivation. Historically, cannabis in the United States has been grown indoors and this trend has continued even as various states have implemented legalization. MILC believes that its strategy of focusing on greenhouse cultivation represents a competitive advantage. Greenhouses cost less to construct and less to operate than indoor cultivation facilities and as such, we believe we can compete favorably with this approach.
 
The cannabis industry is experiencing rapidly growing demand amid the tailwind of increasing legalization at the state level. The inefficient availability of capital in the cannabis industry given the illegal status at the federal level presents a potential opportunity for MILC through its strategic affiliation with Power REIT (NYSE-American ticker: PW and PW.A). Power REIT is focused on financing the real estate component of controlled environment agriculture (CEA) facilities in the form of greenhouses.

Outlook
 
Cannabis
 
We are excited about our new area of focus – sustainable cannabis cultivation in greenhouses. We are also proud of the rapid progress we are making at each site as well as the teams we are building. We are very focused on building teams that draw from the broader business community and people with a focus on greenhouse cultivation rather than just drawing from the cannabis industry. Revenue received in the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately $42,000. We expect to ramp up significantly in 2022 as we seek to generate operating income from these operations. The cannabis industry is growing at a rapid rate and our approach, which is focused on low-cost and sustainable cultivation in greenhouses, is a key component of our long-term business model. Our projects in Colorado and Oklahoma benefit from the potential for rapid speed to revenue. Our most recent project in Michigan is the largest cannabis cultivation facility in Michigan and, once operational, should compete very well in this rapidly growing market. We are focused on bringing best in class, large-scale mainstream greenhouse agricultural cultivation techniques to the cannabis industry.
Carbon
 
While we are disappointed with the status of the Hawaii endeavor, we believe that the experience has led to what could be an exciting opportunity to develop a sustainable approach to the production of Activated Carbon from waste materials. Typical production of activated carbon has a very high carbon footprint whereas we believe our approach may have a negative carbon footprint. We look forward to continuing to develop this novel concept which should have applications beyond our initial waste stream feedstock.

Sustainability
 
Cannabis
 
In 2021, according to BofA Securities, the U.S. Regulated Cannabis industry generated $25 billion in sales revenue representing 40% growth year over year. This growth is partly driven by changing attitudes towards cannabis. According to a 2021 Pew Research Poll, 91% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal, while only 9% say that it should not. As of March 15, 2022, 36 states have legalized marijuana for medical use, 16 have legalized recreational use, and these numbers are expected to continue to rise.
 
Millennium Cannabis LLC, (“MillCann”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MILC, is focused on a sustainable approach to cannabis cultivation through Controlled Environmental Agriculture (CEA) in the form of greenhouses. MillCann currently has operations in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Michigan. Millcann is focused on bringing best-in-class, large scale agriculture techniques to the cannabis industry.
 
Millennium Cannabis focuses on cultivation of cannabis in Controlled Environment Agriculture facilities (CEA) in the form of greenhouses. Greenhouses represent a more sustainable approach to the cultivation of cannabis relative to indoor cultivation which accounts for the majority of cannabis cultivation in the United States. By focusing on greenhouses, MILC provides an extremely environmentally friendly solution, which consumes approximately 70% less energy than indoor growing operations that do not benefit from “free” sunlight and requires significant amounts of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”). Greenhouses use 90% less water than field grown plants, and all of MILC’s greenhouse properties operate without the use of pesticides avoiding agricultural runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. These facilities cultivate medical Cannabis, which has been recommended to help manage a myriad of medical symptoms, including seizures and spasms, Multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraines, arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s.
 
During 2021, Millennium Cannabis made significant progress building an experienced cannabis cultivation team. By leveraging the sustainable infrastructure at our three greenhouse cultivation facilities, we are positioned to become a competitive, low-cost producer of high-grade cannabis in each market we operate in.
 
MILC leases its three cannabis cultivation properties from subsidiaries of Power REIT (NYSE AMEX: PW and PW.PRA). David Lesser is Chairman and CEO of Power REIT and also Chairman and CEO of MILC. MILC’s affiliation with Power REIT provides efficient access to capital allowing MILC to establish operations quickly and become a sustainable high-quality, low-cost producer of cannabis.
 
Carbon
 
The global Activated Carbon market is expected to continue an upward trend over the next decade reaching $8.9 billion by 2026 as cited by MarketsandMarkets, 2021. Activated Carbon is used in a variety of filtration and purification applications which help improve the environment and is also important to the manufacture of many products. Expanding urbanization, construction, and chemical production is increasing the amount of waste in need of treatment. We believe that additional tailwinds from the global push for decarbonization, pollution control, and sustainable manufacturing processes may increase demand for and interest in, Activated Carbon related opportunities.
 
Millennium Carbon, LLC (“MillCarbon”) is a wholly owned subsidiary that is currently developing a novel technology for the sustainable production of Activated Carbon. The primary feedstock for the production of Activated Carbon is coal and the overall process has a very high carbon footprint. Our proprietary technology will use carbon dense waste streams that often represent disposal problems as its feedstock. In doing so, MillCarbon is expected to not only solves a waste problem but also generates Activated Carbon that can be used in industry for purification and filtration.

MillCarbon has constructed a proof-of-concept pilot-scale plant in Kentucky, using novel technology to produce Activated Carbon from a waste stream (“Stillage”) generated by Bourbon distilleries as its feedstock. MillCarbon believes that the bourbon industry in Kentucky generates in excess of 1 billion gallons per year of Stillage and this represents a significant environmental disposal problem. Initial results from the operation of the pilot-scale plant are encouraging. MILC is commencing the evaluation of constructing a commercial scale plant.
 
Millennium HI Carbon, LLC (“MHC”) is a wholly owned subsidiary that acquired an Activated Carbon plant in Hawaii (the “Hawaii Plant”) that was intended to produce a very high-grade form of Activated Carbon for the production of ultracapacitors which are an advanced electrical storage device. During the first half of 2019, MHC concluded that the Hawaii Plant was not capable of producing consistent results and has made efforts to minimize overhead and cash drain while it seeks a strategic alternative for the Hawaii Plant. Effective December 31, 2021, MILC determined to write off the remaining value of the HI asset for accounting purposes given that the plant is dormant and there is uncertainty around a business plan for this asset. Impairment of $2,765,000 was recognized as of December 31, 2021 to account for the full write off of the asset.
 
Corporate History
 
MILC was incorporated in Delaware on March 15, 2006 as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar transaction (a “Business Combination”) with an operating business or businesses that have operations primarily in India (a “Target Business”). In January 2008, the acquisition of a 14.75% equity interest in the SMC Group was consummated by MILC upon approval by public stockholders. For stockholders who voted to not approve the acquisition 842,625 shares were redeemed for $6,736,949. As a result of its plan to invest substantially all of its assets in SMC Group stock, MILC was required to register with the SEC as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”).
 
In March 2008, MILC’s interest was reduced to 14.44% due to Bennett Coleman & Co., a leading New Delhi based financial media and investment firm investing in SMC Group. In May 2009, the merger of SMC Group’s two underlying companies, SAM Global Securities Limited (“SAM”) and SMC Global Securities Limited (“SMC Global”) was finalized. In June 2009, MILC’s interest was increased to 15.14% with the shares of SAM and SMC Global (1,298,400 and 1,730,026 shares, respectively) converting to 1,586,738 shares of SMC Global. On July 2, 2011, as previously announced, Sanlam, which is engaged in the business of portfolio management consultancy, increased its stake in SMC Global to a total of approximately 8.36%, by purchasing an additional 3.25% equity stake in SMC Global which reduced MILC’s equity interest in SMC Global to approximately 14.03%. On July 31, 2012, SMC Global held a shareholder meeting and consented to a stock-split of the equity shares of the Company 10:1, increasing MILC’s position of 1,586,738 shares to 15,867,380 shares.
 
On October 3, 2013, MILC announced that public efforts by MILC shareholder Hudson Bay Partners, LP (“HBP”) to secure shareholder support for the replacement of MILC’s Board of Directors with a new director slate resulted in the delivery to MILC of written consents representing more than 50% of the outstanding shares. Accordingly, all of HBP’s director nominees were appointed to the MILC Board of Directors (the “Board”) including the principal of HBP, David H. Lesser, our CEO and Chairman.
 
In December 2013, MILC commenced selling its interest in SMC Global with the intent of completely liquidating its position which was completed in June 2021.
 
On March 4, 2014, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) was amended to reduce the number of the Company’s shares of authorized capital stock from 45,005,000 to 12,005,000. Our Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of 12,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share.
 
Effective June 11, 2014, MILC completed a corporate reorganization which resulted in the change of its name to Millennium Investment & Acquisition Company Inc. (“MILC” or the “Company”) from Millennium India and Acquisition Company Inc., under the laws and procedures of Delaware, the state where the registrant is incorporated. The corporate reorganization was undertaken following a change of investment policy, pursuant to which the registrant’s Board of Directors decided to abandon the registrant’s former policy of investing at least 80% of the value of its net assets and borrowings in equity securities of companies operating in India. In conjunction with the change in investment policy, the Board effected the change of name to remove reference to India, in compliance with the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder.

Mr. David H. Lesser serves as a member and Chairman of our Board of Directors. He also serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. In November 2021, we also announced the appointment of Miriam Rouziek to our Board of Directors. Ms. Rouziek has more than 10 years of accounting, tax, and audit experience.
 
Across our business, we believe our employees are our most valuable asset and that our success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
At the end of 2021, our team had a total of 96 employees of which 92 work on our sustainable cannabis cultivation projects and 4 work on our sustainable production of Activated Carbon.
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
ESG the “Triple Bottom Line”
 
With a focus on the “Triple Bottom Line” and a commitment to Profit, Planet and People, MILC is committed to best-in-class focus on Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors.
 
Environmental
 
We currently focus on sustainable cultivation of cannabis in greenhouse properties which consume dramatically less energy than indoor growing, 90% less water than outdoor growing, and do not generate the agricultural runoff associated with traditional fertilizers or pesticides. In addition, we are developing a novel technology for the sustainable cultivation of Activated Carbon whereby we can replace coal as a feedstock with an organic waste. Activated Carbon is primarily used for filtration and purification.
Social
 
As of December 31, 2021, 100% of our greenhouse facilities produce cannabis which some people consider can be an alternative medical solution for a variety of ailments including, such things as multiple sclerosis, PTSD, arthritis, and seizures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not currently have guidance on the validity of such claims. We are also creating a significant amount of employment opportunities in the markets we operate in.
Governance
 
MILC has a four-person Board with three independent Directors. Each Director serves a one-year term and as such, we do not have a staggered board. In addition, we do not have any other management protection structures such as “poison pills” or “golden parachutes.” MILC management has strong alignment with shareholders through significant insider ownership. We believe that our corporate governance is a strong component of our ESG profile.
 
As our ESG story and portfolio expand, we intend to continue to build our investor engagement efforts, driving our commitment to the planet, its people, and generating returns for our shareholders.
