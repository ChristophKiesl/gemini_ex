Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global leader in application development, empowering enterprises to build mission-critical business applications to succeed in an evolving business environment. With offerings spanning web, mobile and data for on-premise and cloud environments, we power businesses worldwide, promoting success one application at a time. Our solutions are used across a variety of industries.
Our products are generally sold as perpetual licenses, but certain products also use term licensing models and our cloud-based offerings use a subscription based model. More than half of our worldwide license revenue is realized through relationships with indirect channel partners, principally application partners and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Application partners are independent software vendors (ISVs) that develop and market applications using our technology and resell our products in conjunction with sales of their own products that incorporate our technology. OEMs are companies that embed our products into their own software products or devices.
We operate in North America and Latin America (the Americas); Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia Pacific region, through local subsidiaries as well as independent distributors.
Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights and Recent Developments
Leadership Changes
In October 2016, Yogesh Gupta became our President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Philip Pead, who had been our President and Chief Executive Officer since December 2012. Mr. Pead remains a member of our Board of Directors. In September 2016, Kurt Abkemeier became our Chief Financial Officer, replacing Chris Perkins, who had been our Chief Financial Officer since February 2013.
New Strategic Plan
On January 16, 2017, we announced a new strategic plan highlighted by a new product strategy and a streamlined operating approach with a tighter focus on areas of strength to more efficiently drive revenue. The key tenets of the new strategic plan are as follows:

• | Streamlined Operating Approach. In fiscal year 2017, we have begun to adapt our organization and operating principles for our core products to focus primarily on customer and partner retention and success. For certain of our products, we are also strengthening our high volume, low touch e-commerce capabilities. 


• | New Product Strategy. As part of the new strategic plan, we are undertaking a new product strategy in which we will provide the platform and tools enterprises need to build next generation applications that drive their businesses known as “Cognitive Applications.” Our platform for Cognitive Applications will make it easy for developers to build these new applications and will include: 

4

◦Our NativeScript offering, which allows developers to use JavaScript to build native applications across            multiple platforms;
◦A mission-critical back-end-as-a-service platform that runs on any cloud, is secure, high-performing, and            highly-scalable while supporting all modern user interfaces;
◦Automated and intuitive machine learning capabilities for accelerating the creation and delivery of Cognitive        Applications;
◦Our data connectivity and integration capabilities; and
◦Our business logic and rules capabilities.
Our new product strategy replaces our prior strategy focused around our Digital Factory offering, which is a cloud-based solution combining primarily two of our products, Sitefinity and Telerik Platform. Although we are discontinuing our investment in our Digital Factory offering, Sitefinity remains a core product within our portfolio and Telerik Platform is a key part of our new product strategy.

• | Restructuring. With the adoption of our new product strategy, we are discontinuing our investment in our Digital Factory offering and re-aligning our resources consistent with our core operating approach. To that end, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we began to implement restructuring efforts including the consolidation of facilities, implementation of a simplified organizational structure and a reduction of marketing and other external expenses. In addition, we began to reduce headcount by approximately 450 employees, totaling over 20% of our workforce. Initial headcount reductions commenced in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2017, subject to local laws and consultation processes. After investments in our new product strategy, we expect to reduce net annual run-rate costs by approximately $20 million by the end of fiscal year 2017. 

Share Repurchase Authorization
In March 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $100.0 million share repurchase program, which increased the total authorization to $214.5 million. In fiscal year 2016, we repurchased and retired 3.1 million shares of common stock for $79.2 million under our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase program, leaving $135.3 million remaining under this program.
Dividend Declaration
On September 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. The first quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock was paid on December 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2016. On January 11, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock payable on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2017.
Our Business Segments

Data Connectivity and Integration Business Segment
The Data Connectivity and Integration Business Segment (DCI) is focused on the growth of our data assets, including the data integration components of our cloud offerings. Data is at the core of every application, and with the exponential growth in the number and volume of data sources, this business segment addresses the increasingly complex challenges that organizations have in accessing and integrating that data.
The solutions within the DCI Business Segment include:
Progress DataDirect Connect

In addition to integrating with our other cloud-based offerings, it provides the capability to connect and integrate with other applications and data sources independently.
Application Development and Deployment Business Segment
The Application Development and Deployment (AppDev) business segment is focused on generating net new customers for our application development assets. Substantially all of the products within the AppDev segment were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Telerik, Inc. in December 2014. This business segment has the focus and agility of a start-up, able to react quickly to changes in this rapidly-evolving market. Having a team solely focused on this market enables us to rapidly meet the demands of developers who are seeking to increase their productivity and move toward the cloud.
The solutions within the AppDev Business Segment include:
Dev Tools

Progress Rollbase
Progress Rollbase is application development software that allows rapid creation of SaaS business applications using point & click, drag & drop tools in a standard web browser with a minimal amount of code. Progress Rollbase applications can be deployed in any cloud or on-premise infrastructure.
Product Development
Most of our products have been developed by our internal product development staff or the internal staffs of acquired companies. We believe that the features and performance of our products are competitive with those of other available development and deployment tools and that none of the current versions of our products are approaching obsolescence. However, we believe that significant investments in new product development and continuing enhancements of our current products will be required for us to maintain our competitive position.
As of November 30, 2016, we have four primary development offices in North America, two primary development offices in EMEA and one primary development office in India. We spent $88.6 million, $88.3 million, and $63.1 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on product development, including capitalized software development costs.
Customers
We market our products globally through several channels: directly to end users and indirectly to application partners (or ISVs), OEMs, and system integrators. Sales of our solutions and products through our direct sales force have historically been to business managers or IT managers in corporations and governmental agencies. We also target developers who create business applications, from individuals to teams, within enterprises of all sizes.
We also market our products through indirect channels, primarily application partners and OEMs who embed our products as part of an integrated solution. We use international distributors in certain locations where we do not have a direct presence or where it is more economically feasible for us to do so.
More than half of our license revenues are derived from indirect channels. No single customer has accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of our last three fiscal years.
Application Partners
Our application partners cover a broad range of markets, offer an extensive library of business applications and are a source of follow-on revenue. We have kept entry costs, consisting primarily of the initial purchase of development licenses, low to encourage a wide variety of application partners to build applications. If an application partner succeeds in marketing its applications, we obtain follow-on revenue as the application partner licenses our deployment products to allow its application to be installed and used by customers. We offer a subscription model alternative to the traditional perpetual license model for application partners who have chosen to enable their business applications under a SaaS platform.

Original Equipment Manufacturers
We enter into arrangements with OEMs whereby the OEM embeds our products into its solutions, typically either software or technology devices. OEMs typically license the right to embed our products into their solutions and distribute such solutions for initial terms ranging from one to three years. Historically, a significant portion of our OEMs have renewed their agreements upon the expiration of the initial term. However, we are not assured that they will continue to renew in the future.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products and solutions through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners. We have sold our products and solutions to enterprises in over 180 countries. Our sales and field marketing groups are organized by business segment and secondarily by region. We operate by region in North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. We believe this structure allows us to maintain direct contact with our customers and support their diverse market requirements. Our international operations provide focused local sales, support and marketing efforts and are able to respond directly to changes in local conditions.
In addition to our direct sales efforts, we distribute our products through systems integrators, resellers, distributors, and OEM partners in the United States and internationally. Systems integrators typically have expertise in vertical or functional markets. In some cases, they resell our products, bundling them with their broader service offerings. In other cases, they refer sales opportunities to our direct sales force for our products. Distributors sublicense our products and provide service and support within their territories. OEMs embed portions of our technology in their product offerings.
Sales personnel are responsible for developing new direct end user accounts, recruiting new indirect channel partners and new independent distributors, managing existing channel partner relationships and servicing existing customers. We actively seek to avoid conflict between the sales efforts of our application partners and our own direct sales efforts. We use our inside sales team to enhance our direct sales efforts and to generate new business and follow-on business from existing customers.
Our marketing personnel conduct a variety of marketing engagement programs designed to create demand for our products, enhance the market readiness of our products, raise the general awareness of our company and our products and solutions, generate leads for the sales organization and promote our various products. These programs include press relations, analyst relations, investor relations, digital/web marketing, marketing communications, participation in trade shows and industry conferences, and production of sales and marketing literature. We also hold global events, as well as regional user events in various locations throughout the world.
Our sales and marketing efforts with respect to certain of our products, including Dev Tools and the Telerik Platform, differ from our traditional sales and marketing efforts because the target markets are different. For these products, we have designed our marketing and sales model to be efficient for high volumes of lower-price transactions. Our marketing efforts focus on driving traffic to our websites and on generating high quality sales leads, in many cases, consisting of developer end users who download a free evaluation of our software. Our sales efforts then focus on converting these leads into paying customers through a high volume, short duration, sales process. Of particular importance to our target market, we enable our customers to buy our products in a manner convenient to them, whether by purchase order, online with a credit card or through our channel partners.
Customer Support
Our customer support staff provides telephone and Web-based support to end users, application developers and OEMs. Customers may purchase maintenance services entitling them to software updates, technical support and technical bulletins. Maintenance is generally not required with our products and is purchased at the customer's option. We provide support to customers primarily through our main regional customer support centers in Bedford, Massachusetts; Morrisville, North Carolina; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Hyderabad, India; Melbourne, Australia; and Sofia, Bulgaria. Local technical support for specific products is provided in certain other countries as well.
Professional Services
Our global professional services organization delivers business solutions for customers through a combination of products, consulting and education. Our consulting organization offers project management, implementation services, custom development, programming and other services. Our consulting organization also provides services to Web-enable existing applications or to take advantage of the capabilities of new product releases. Our education organization offers numerous training options, from traditional instructor-led courses to advanced learning modules available via the web or on CDs.

Our services offerings include: application modernization; data management, managed database services; performance enhancements and tuning; and analytics/business intelligence. 
Competition
The computer software industry is intensely competitive. We experience significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to all of our products. Factors affecting competition in the markets we serve include product performance in complex applications, application solutions, vendor experience, ease of integration, price, training and support.
We compete in various markets with a number of entities, such as salesforce.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Software AG, RedHat, Inc., Pivotal Software, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and other smaller firms. Many of these vendors offer platform-as-a-service (PaaS), application development, data integration and other tools in conjunction with their CRM, web services, operating systems and relational database management systems. We believe that IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation currently dominate the relational database market. We do not believe that there is a dominant vendor in the other infrastructure software markets, including application development. Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing or technical resources than we have and/or may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Increased competition could make it more difficult for us to maintain our revenue and market presence.
Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We generally distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a perpetual nonexclusive license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products. We also distribute our products through various channel partners, including application partners, OEMs and system integrators. We also license our products under term or subscription arrangements.  In addition, we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with employees, consultants and channel partners. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there is no assurance that these measures will be successful.
We seek to protect the source code of our products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works. We hold numerous patents covering portions of our products. We also have several patent applications for some of our other product technologies. Where possible, we seek to obtain protection of our product names and service offerings through trademark registration and other similar procedures throughout the world.
We believe that due to the rapid pace of innovation within our industry, factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel are as important in establishing and maintaining a leadership position within the industry as are the various legal protections of our technology. In addition, we believe that the nature of our customers, the importance of our products to them and their need for continuing product support may reduce the risk of unauthorized reproduction, although no assurances can be made in this regard.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
Effective September 1, 2014, we began operating as three distinct business segments: OpenEdge, Data Connectivity and Integration, and Application Development and Deployment and began segment reporting for these business segments beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014. For additional information on business segments as well as geographical financial information, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Employees
As of November 30, 2016, we had 1,912 employees worldwide, including 578 in sales and marketing, 269 in customer support and services, 812 in product development and 253 in administration. On January 16, 2017, we announced that we will reduce headcount by approximately 450 employees, totaling over 20% of our workforce. Initial headcount reductions began in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2017, subject to local laws and consultation processes.
None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local workers’ councils and/or collective bargaining agreements as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe our relations with employees are good.
