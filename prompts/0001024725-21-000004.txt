DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We design, manufacture, market, and distribute innovative products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, motorsport, and aftermarket customers. We serve both original equipment (“OE”) vehicle designers and manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets worldwide. Our portfolio of the industry’s most well-respected, enduring brands includes Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, and others. We seek to leverage our OE product engineering and development capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. We effectively manage the life cycle of a broad range of products to a diverse customer base.
We source various raw materials and component parts for use in our manufacturing processes through the global supply chain. As a Tier 1 parts supplier, we produce individual component parts for vehicles as well as groups of components that are combined as modules or systems within vehicles. These parts, modules, and systems are sold globally to the world's leading light vehicle and commercial truck manufacturers as well as aftermarket customers, including a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores, and mass merchants that distribute our products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers, and directly to service chains. 
Our Industry 
The parts industry for vehicles and engines is generally separated into two categories, both of which we operate within: OE parts that are sold in large quantities directly for use by manufacturers of light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and other mobility markets; and “aftermarket” or repair and replacement parts that are sold in varying quantities to wholesalers, retailers, and installers, as well as Original Equipment Service (“OES”) parts sold to OE customers to support their service channels. Light vehicles are comprised of passenger cars and light trucks, which include sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”), crossover vehicles (“CUVs”), pick-up trucks, vans, and multi-purpose passenger vehicles. Commercial vehicles include commercial trucks, off-highway vehicles and industrial equipment. Other mobility markets include two-wheel and motorsports. 
Global OE Industry
Products for the global OE industry are sold directly to OE manufacturers that use these parts, which include components, systems, subsystems, and modules, in the manufacture of new light vehicles, commercial vehicles, rail, two-wheeler, and motorsports. Demand for component parts in the OE market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles/engines produced, which is driven by macroeconomic conditions and other factors such as fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory requirements, technology trends, and trade agreements. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow revenues by increasing their product content per vehicle. Companies, like us, with a global presence, leading technology and innovation, and advanced product, engineering, manufacturing, and customer support capabilities are best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Key Industry Trends Affecting the Global OE Industry
Global Light Vehicle Sales and Production
Our business is directly affected by automotive sales and automotive vehicle production levels. Both of these depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions, population growth, public health conditions, and policies. There have been periods of increased market volatility and uncertainty in the level of economic growth in China, which has resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates than previously experienced. Despite these declines, and the recent moderations in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China are expected to result in stronger growth rates over the long-term. 
We have a strong local presence in China, including a manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions, and may be affected if the pace of growth slows in China or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. However, we continue to believe there is long-term growth potential in this market based on increasing long-term automotive and vehicle content demand.
Sourcing by OE Manufacturers and Component Part Number Proliferation
As OE manufacturers expand their reach, many are looking for suppliers with a global footprint and the capability to supply them with full system integration and solutions, rather than individual standalone products.
Because of these trends, OE manufacturers are increasingly seeking suppliers capable of supporting vehicle platforms on a global basis. They want suppliers like us with design, production, engineering, and logistics capabilities that can be accessed not just in North America and Europe but also in emerging markets such as India and China. OE manufacturers have standardized on global platforms, designing basic mechanical structures suitable for a number of similar vehicle models and are able to accommodate different features across regions. This standardization will drive growth in production of light vehicles designed on global platforms. Accordingly, global platforms, identified as platforms produced in more than one region, are expected to grow. While the overall number of vehicle platforms will consolidate and decrease, the component level complexity to meet the diversified consumer and regulatory requirements around the world is expected to cause component part number proliferation.
As new and existing OE manufacturers look to simplify and streamline design, they are also increasingly selecting suppliers like us that provide fully-engineered, integrated systems, and solutions. OE manufacturers have steadily outsourced more of the design and manufacturing of vehicle parts and systems to simplify the assembly process, lower costs, and reduce development times. Furthermore, they have demanded from their parts suppliers fully integrated, functional modules, and systems made possible with the development of advanced electronics in addition to innovative, individual vehicle components, and parts that may not readily interface together. 
Increasing Technologically Sophisticated Content and Vehicle Complexity
As end users and consumers continue to demand vehicles with improved performance, safety, and functionality at competitive prices, the components and systems in these vehicles are becoming technologically more advanced and sophisticated. Mechanical functions are being replaced with electronics and mechanical and electronic devices are being integrated into single systems. In addition, value added features delivered through software control algorithms and over-the-air updates are becoming more prevalent, creating new avenues for product differentiation and customization.
Enhanced Vehicle Safety and Handling
To serve the needs of their customers and meet government mandates, OE manufacturers are seeking parts suppliers that invest in new technologies, capabilities, and products, which advance vehicle safety and handling, such as roll-over protection systems, advanced suspension technologies, and safer, more durable materials. Suppliers, like us, that are able to offer such innovative products and technologies have a distinct competitive advantage. We offer adjustable and adaptive damping as well as semi-active suspension systems designed to improve vehicle stability, handling, and control. 
We also are a global leader in the development of leading friction formulas that improve vehicle stopping distances and performance. As the commercial truck customers migrate to air disc brake systems, we remain at the forefront of providing the brake friction necessary for these new systems.
Many of our aftermarket products directly affect vehicle performance. Product quality, reliability, and consistency are paramount to our end-customers, the majority of whom are professional service technicians. Our engineering expertise and product capabilities from chassis to braking allow us to provide around-the-wheel offering. Additionally, we have a number of braking products including disc pads for passenger cars, motorcycles, and commercial vehicles; drum brake shoes and linings for commercial vehicles; and brake accessories including rotors, drums, hydraulics, hardware, and brake fluid. 
Advanced Suspension, Autonomous Driving, and Shared Mobility
There is a growing demand for autonomy and new mobility services. A number of trends are driving “Auto 2.0,” defined as the transformation of cars into hybrid systems, fully-electric and autonomous vehicles, the consumer shift from individual car ownership to ride-sharing, and multi-modal forms of mobility. 
We expect higher levels of autonomy will drive increased passenger expectations for a comfortable ride, which, in turn, will create additional content opportunities per vehicle and heighten demand for advanced suspension technology products, including full-corner/around-the-wheel intelligent suspension systems and broader motion management solutions. Advanced suspension technology is expected to grow with adoption led by existing and emerging global OE manufacturers. Increased connectivity also presents additional prospects for active suspension systems, predictive vehicle diagnostics, and system-based integration within the vehicle as well as broader vehicle to everything (“V2X”) communications. The addition of Öhlins to the portfolio is expected to continue to accelerate the development of advanced suspension technology solutions, while also fast-tracking time to market. It will also enhance our portfolio in broader mobility markets through the addition of Öhlins’ range of premium OE and aftermarket automotive and motorsports performance products.
The electrification of vehicles continues to expand, driven by government regulations, as well as a shift in consumer mobility options from individual mobility to shared mobility. Shared mobility describes a range of transportation options that involve the shared use of a vehicle, motorcycle, scooter, bicycle or other means of travel; it provides users with short-term access to transportation on an as-needed basis. Shared mobility may reduce vehicle volumes in established markets, but it also provides an opportunity for us to develop higher-mileage, durable solutions to meet the needs of new mobility fleets, as well as aftermarket replacement solutions and services. Additionally, ride comfort will become an important differentiator in the future.
Focus on Fuel Efficiency Improvements and Powertrain Evolution, including Electrification
Continued evolution and focus on climate change and environmental sustainability by consumers and governments worldwide is increasing the expectations for the auto industry to develop more fuel-efficient and reduced emissions solutions. Various jurisdictions around the world have announced plans to limit the production of new diesel and gasoline powered vehicles in the future. Major vehicle manufacturers have announced their intention to reduce and phase out production of diesel and gasoline powered vehicles during the next two decades. However, for the foreseeable future, it is expected that the majority of the powertrains for light and commercial vehicles will be gasoline and diesel engines (including hybrids, which combine a battery electric drive with a combustion engine). While we see similar electrification trends for light vehicle and commercial vehicle in the long-term, we expect light vehicles will experience those trends in advance of commercial vehicles. We expect to monitor those trends and adopt our business strategy accordingly.
The evolution of alternative powertrain technology, including the increased adoption of fully electric and hybrid powertrains, will also create further opportunities for increased ride performance and NVH capabilities, as consumers look for smoother, quieter, and more efficient rides. Engine downsizing and hybridization will lead to a proliferation of NVH requirements per platform as road noise and other NVH properties that were once masked by engine noise become more apparent to consumers. Furthermore, fully electric vehicles (“EVs”) will likely have a suite of fundamentally different NVH, braking, and ride performance requirements. Our capabilities in the suspension, braking, and NVH performance materials categories provide the opportunity to develop solutions to maximize driving comfort, ride performance, and motion management for consumers worldwide in the increasing electrification and hybridization of the global vehicle fleet.
The demand for smaller but more powerful engines requires more technology per engine to withstand the higher output requirements and reduce friction, which we estimate will result in an increase in content per engine for our powertrain business. With a global manufacturing presence, we believe we are well-positioned to meet expectations of our global customers. 
Commercial Vehicles
Our business is also directly affected by commercial vehicle sales and production levels. Both of these depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions, population growth, public health conditions, and policies. In addition, regulations have been adopted to regulate tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide, as well as brake dust emissions and copper content. Reducing carbon-dioxide (“CO2”) emissions requires improving fuel economy; as a result, improved combustion efficiency and reduction of vehicle mass have become priorities. The products our clean air segment provides reduce the tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. As a leading supplier of clean air systems and friction materials with strong technical capabilities in both areas, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the more rigorous environmental standards being adopted around the world. Current regulations in the developed markets are being adopted in the developing markets and should increase content opportunities for our business in the medium-term. 
Global Aftermarket Industry 
Products for the global aftermarket are sold directly to a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores, and mass merchants that distribute these products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers, and directly to service chains, as well as OES parts sold to OE customers to support their service channels. Demand for aftermarket products historically has been driven by four primary factors: 
i.the number of vehicles in operation (“VIO”); 
ii.the average age of VIO; 
iii.vehicle usage trends, including miles driven and gasoline consumption; and 
iv.component replacement and wear rates. 
These factors, while applicable in all regions, vary depending on the composition of VIO and other factors.
Key trends affecting the Global Aftermarket Industry
Global Growth of Vehicles in Operation, Average Vehicle Age, and Vehicle Usage Trends
With increased age and usage, vehicles become subject to maintenance, repair, and component part replacement thereby increasing the overall demand for aftermarket parts. The global number of VIO is expected to grow, with the number of VIO in emerging markets such as China expected to increase significantly. The number of VIO in mature markets, such as North America is expected to grow, and to a lot lesser extent in Europe. We have strong aftermarket positions in North America, Europe, and South America and a growing aftermarket position in Asia. We expect there to be aftermarket growth opportunities in emerging markets such as China and India where the VIO are expected to increase. We are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this growth by leveraging our industry renowned brands and market-leading capabilities to develop the distributor base, drive brand recognition, increase product coverage, and build the supply chain in emerging growth markets.
Non-Branded Private Labels 
We have some of the strongest and most recognized brands in the automotive aftermarket. We will continue to invest in product innovation, marketing, and brand support that differentiates our premium branded products for their quality and performance while also supporting lower priced, mid-grade offerings. Additionally, we will continue to drive productivity and cost reduction efforts and enhance our already strong global sourcing capabilities to remain competitive in each product tier.
Retailers or wholesale distributors creating private label brands still rely on established suppliers to design and manufacture their private label products and, in some cases, utilize co-branding to support their private label offerings. We intend to selectively continue to co-brand with private label distributors where it can help to strategically grow our branded products portfolio.
Supply Chain Velocity and Distribution Capability
Efficient distribution capabilities are essential as the aftermarket industry works to balance product availability with overall inventory in the ecosystem. Installers expect the right product to be available at the right time and the need for fast, predictable local parts delivery is growing as consumers' expectations for quick, high quality service increase. In addition, we are seeing the developing aftermarket augment traditional distribution and service models with real-time scheduling through personalized internet applications. We are adjusting our fulfillment models to optimize this complexity and better align and synchronize with our customers and supply base to reduce non-value add steps, time, and distance in our value chain. We are also engaging with key customers to jointly optimize product availability and delivery.
The increasing global vehicle population, brand and vehicle complexity, and need for rapid new part introduction, as well as new distribution channels (including e-commerce) continue to drive significant stock keeping unit (“SKU”) proliferation and business complexity. Our recent investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities are designed to manage this complexity, which we believe will be an important competitive differentiator.
Channel Consolidation
In the more mature markets of North America and Europe, there has been increasing consolidation in the aftermarket distribution channel with larger aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. These distributors generally require larger, more capable suppliers that have the ability to provide world-class product expertise, category management capabilities, brand management, and supply chain support, as well as a competitive manufacturing and sourcing network. We have undertaken many initiatives to enhance the value of our branded products to end-market consumers and diversify our revenue base. 
Growth of e-Commerce Capabilities and Changing Consumer Decision Making 
Reaching end-customers, which include professional service providers, technicians, and “do-it-yourself” consumers, directly through online and mobile application capabilities, including e-commerce, is expected to have an increasing effect on the global aftermarket industry and how aftermarket products are marketed and sold. The establishment of a robust online presence will be critical for suppliers regardless of whether they intend to participate directly in e-commerce. We invested heavily in e-commerce initiatives to improve our capabilities and connectivity to our end-customers, including a new online order management system, customer relationship management tools, global brand websites, and data analytics capabilities. We will continue to invest in these competencies. 
Additionally, consumers increasingly are utilizing online research prior to making buying or repair decisions. We will continue to expand our online presence in order to connect with our customers and more effectively communicate the value of our premium aftermarket brands.
Resilience during Economic Downturn
Aftermarket products are largely stable, non-discretionary, and less susceptible to cyclicality as customers often have no choice but to replace automotive parts that are worn. During the 2008 economic downturn, the number of consumers with the ability to purchase new vehicles declined and led to increased demand for aftermarket parts in order to keep older vehicles road-worthy. During 2020 the COVID-19 global pandemic, we also experienced expanded demand from “do-it-yourself” consumers and e-commerce, which partially offset the short-term demand decline due to lockdowns and travel restrictions.
Customers
We strive to develop long-standing business relationships with our customers around the world. We work collaboratively with our OE customers in all stages of production and post production service, including design, development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing, and delivery. For both OE and aftermarket customers, we provide timely delivery of quality products at competitive prices and deliver customer service. With our diverse product mix and numerous facilities in major markets worldwide, we believe we are well positioned to meet customer needs. 
Our OE customers consist of automotive and commercial vehicle manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, two-wheel, marine, railroad, aerospace, high performance, and power generation and industrial application manufacturers. We have well-established relationships with substantially all major American, European, and Asian automotive OE manufacturers. In automotive, legacy OE customer consolidation continues to occur and could increase our exposure to certain customers in the future.
The following customers accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three years.

Customer | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
General Motors Company | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | %
Ford Motor Company | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 12 | %

Our aftermarket customers include a wide range of distributors that redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, e-commerce retailers, mass merchants, and service chains. The breadth of our product lines, the value of our reputable brands, the strength of our leading marketing expertise, a sizable sales force, and supply chain and logistics capabilities are central to our success in the aftermarket. We have a large and diverse aftermarket customer base. 
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets. Customer loyalty is a key element of competition in these markets and is developed through long-standing relationships, customer service, high quality value-added products, and timely delivery. Product pricing and services provided are other important competitive factors.
As a supplier of OE and aftermarket parts, we compete with vehicle manufacturers, some of which are also customers of ours, and numerous independent suppliers. We believe we are meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, strengthening our brand proposition, efficiently integrating and expanding our manufacturing and distribution operations, optimizing our product coverage within our core businesses, restructuring our operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing our worldwide network of technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to our customers.
Seasonality
Our businesses are somewhat seasonal. OE production is historically higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. It typically decreases in the third quarter due to OE plant shutdowns for model changeovers and European holidays, and softens further in the fourth quarter due to reduced production during the end-of-year holiday season in North America and Europe. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. Our aftermarket operations experience relatively higher demand during the spring as vehicle owners prepare for the summer driving season. While seasonality does affect our business, actual results may vary from the above trends due to global and local economic dynamics, global pandemics, as well as industry-specific platform launches and other production-related events. 
Order Fulfillment
For OE customers, we generally receive long-term production contracts for specific products supplied for particular vehicles with target volumes. These supply relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle, subject to interim design and technical specification revisions. In addition to customary commercial terms and conditions, long-term production contracts generally provide for annual price adjustments based upon expected productivity improvements, material price variation, and other factors. OE customers typically retain the right to terminate agreements due to changing business conditions, but they generally cannot terminate agreements given development cycles and change costs. OE order fulfillment is typically manufactured in response to customer purchase order releases, as we ship directly from a manufacturing location to a customer for use in vehicle production and assembly. Accordingly, our manufacturing locations turn finished goods inventory relatively quickly, producing from on-hand raw materials and work-in-process inventory within relatively short manufacturing cycles. Risks to us include a change in vehicle production, lower than expected vehicle or engine production by one or more of our OE customers, or termination of the business based upon perceived or actual shortfalls in delivery, quality or value.
For our global aftermarket customers, we generally establish arrangements that encompass substantially all parts offered within a particular product line. In some cases, we will enter into agreements with terms ranging from one to three years that cover one or more product lines. Pricing is market responsive and subject to adjustment based upon competitive pressures, material costs, and other commercial factors. Typical price adjustments occur on an annual basis as part of the product line reviews or as environmental factors dictate. Global aftermarket order fulfillment is largely performed from finished goods inventory stocked in our regional distribution centers. Inventory stocking levels in our distribution centers are established based upon historical and anticipated future customer demand, adjusted for lead times, demand variability, and target service levels.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation we will supply certain levels of OE production over such periods, we believe outstanding purchase orders and product line arrangements do not constitute firm orders. Firm orders are limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible after receipt from the conversion of available raw materials and work-in-process inventory for OE orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. 
Clean Air Segment
Our Clean Air Segment operates 66 clean air manufacturing facilities worldwide, of which 17 facilities are located in North America, 20 in Europe, 3 in South America, and 26 in Asia Pacific.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
We have separate and distinct sales and marketing efforts for our OE and aftermarket customers.
For OE sales, our sales and marketing team is an integrated group of sales professionals, including skilled engineers and program managers, who are organized globally by customer business unit and product type (e.g., Ride Performance, Clean Air, and Powertrain). Our sales and marketing teams are focused on meeting and exceeding our customer's needs by delivering engineered products and services on time; maximizing profit for our investors while financing continued growth and product development; and developing a common system approach to create a superior customer experience. Our teams provide the appropriate mix of operational and technical expertise needed to interface successfully with OE manufacturers. Our business capture process involves targeting select programs and working closely with the OE manufacturer platform engineering and purchasing teams. Bidding on OE automotive platforms typically encompasses many months of engineering and business development activity. Throughout the process, our sales team, program managers, and product engineers assist the OE customer in defining the project’s technical and business requirements. A normal part of the process includes our engineering and sales personnel working on customers’ integrated product teams, creating a statement of requirements, and assisting our customers with full system or component design and development concepts that deliver on expectations and create value for OE manufacturer customers. Given that Clean Air, Ride Performance, and Powertrain operations typically involve long-term production contracts awarded on a platform-by-platform basis, our strategy is to leverage our engineering expertise and strong customer relationships to target and win new business and increase operating margins.
For aftermarket sales and marketing, our sales force is generally organized by region and customer and covers multiple product lines. We sell aftermarket products through five primary channels of distribution: (1) traditional three-step distribution system of full-line warehouse distributors, jobbers, and service providers; (2) two-step distribution system of warehouse distributors that distribute directly to the service providers; (3) direct sales to retailers; (4) direct sales to service provider chains; and (5) direct sales through e-commerce channels. Our aftermarket sales and marketing representatives cover all levels of the distribution channel, stimulating interest in our products and helping our products move through the distribution system. Also, to generate demand for our products, we run print, online, outdoor advertisements, digital advertising and social media, as well as training conducted by our field sales force and e-training courses. In addition, we maintain detailed websites for certain of our brands. 
Business Strategy
We are a leading diversified, global supplier of innovative products and services to light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, and aftermarket customers. Our strategy focuses on addressing the evolving needs of our OE and aftermarket customers around the world to drive growth. The key components of our business strategy are described below:
Continue to optimize operational performance by aggressively pursuing cost competitiveness in all business segments and continuing to drive cash flow generation and meet capital allocation objectives
As we continue to expand our distribution and service capabilities globally, we seek to continue optimizing our performance through enhanced efficiencies in order to meet the world-class delivery performance our customers increasingly require. We have made and will continue to make investments in our global distribution network to optimize our manufacturing and fulfillment footprint and manage complexities of our supply chain. By achieving efficiency gains and cost competitiveness, we strive to generate strong cash flow and meet our capital allocation objectives, including deleveraging our balance sheet.
From a design perspective, we will bring a lean mindset to our portfolio to ensure standardization, remove redundancies, focus on our core business, reduce transit costs, leverage economies of scale, and optimize manufacturing productivity. We will also continually look for ways to innovate and leverage cross- and up-sell opportunities to the market through a customer-centric product development process. From a manufacturing perspective, we will maintain a continuous improvement philosophy by streamlining plant operations and our network, and executing projects to improve efficiency. 
Serving our customers also requires that we compete effectively at the unit cost level, in particular with OE customers. We are making concerted and systematic efforts to continuously improve our position on the cost curve for each of our component part categories including deploying value stream simplification principals. In doing so, we will continue to be a preferred supplier to our customers.
We will be mindful of the changing market conditions that might necessitate adjustments to our resources and manufacturing capacity around the world. We will also remain committed to protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our employees.
Pursue focused transactional opportunities, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, product line enhancements, technological advancements, geographic positioning, penetration of emerging markets and market share growth
Throughout our history, we have successfully identified and capitalized on acquisitions, alliances, and divestitures to achieve strategic growth and alignment. Through these transactions, we have (1) expanded our product portfolio with complementary technologies; (2) realized incremental business from existing customers; (3) gained access to new customers; (4) achieved leadership positions in geographic regions outside North America; and (5) re-focused on areas that will contribute to our profitable growth. 
We intend to continue to explore strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that complement, expand, enhance or realign our existing products, technology, systems development efforts, customer base and/or global presence. We are committed to developing a broader ecosystem-based approach that allows us to work with new and existing customers, suppliers, and entrants to provide timely and leading-edge solutions across the mobility market. We will align with companies that have proven products, proprietary technology, advanced research capabilities, broad geographic reach, and/or strong market positions to further strengthen our product leadership, technology position, global reach, and customer relationships. 
Adapt cost structure to economic realities
We aggressively respond to difficult economic environments, aligning our operations to any resulting reductions in production levels and replacement demand and executing comprehensive restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives. Suppliers must continually identify and implement product innovation and cost reduction activities to fund customer annual price concession expectations in order to retain current business as well as to be competitively positioned for future new business opportunities. 
Original Equipment Specific Strategies
The converging forces of connectivity, autonomy, electrification, and shared mobility are spawning a new age of automotive autonomy and a unique opportunity to position our business for significant growth and profitability. We strive to strengthen our global position by designing, manufacturing, delivering, and marketing technologically innovative products and solutions for OE manufacturers. The key components of our OE strategy are described below:
Capitalize on our breadth of technology, differentiated products, and global reach to support and strengthen relationships with existing and emerging OE customers across the world
We conduct business with nearly all of the major automotive OE customers around the world. Within the highly competitive automotive parts industry, we seek to extend the significant advantages that come from our world-class global manufacturing, engineering and distribution footprint and global sourcing capabilities. This footprint enables the design, production and delivery of premium parts emphasizing quality, safety and reliability virtually anywhere in the world and also supports the continual innovation of new products, technologies, and solutions for new and existing OE customers.
Maintain technological leadership to drive further growth from secular market trends
In order to maintain our strong market positions, we are focused on meeting changing performance requirements and keeping up with emerging OE trends such as connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility, and electrification. In pursuit of delivering the ideal ride characteristics for any application, our ride performance division will leverage its innovative technology, NVH performance materials, differentiated products, and advanced system capabilities to provide innovative solutions. Aligning product lines and technical capabilities creates an ideal foundation to meet changing performance requirements for comfort and safety and again ultimately reinventing the ride of the future. The 2019 acquisition of Öhlins will continue to accelerate the development of advanced technology suspension solutions, while also fast-tracking time to market. That acquisition is yet another example of our strategy to leverage key technologies that will better position us to take advantage of secular trends. It also enhances our portfolio in broader mobility markets through the addition of Öhlins’ range of premium OE and aftermarket automotive and motorsports performance products. In addition, our suite of mobility solutions under development represents an opportunity to drive greater partnership with OE manufacturers and broader mobility ecosystem players, creating and capturing value, and growth with higher value content per vehicle.
OE manufacturers are responding to changing end customer trends and preferences alongside their own challenging cost structures by reducing design and production complexities and investing in advanced technologies that enable vehicle electrification and autonomy. We anticipate that OE suppliers with high technology capabilities in vehicle system integration will be able to enable a more seamless transition to next-generation electric vehicles and become preferred suppliers to OE manufacturers. Though many vehicle and customer requirements will evolve, we believe one of the remaining characteristics that will continue to provide differentiated experience and value in the future of mobility is the ride experience. By leveraging our deep component level expertise as well as working with partners across the broader mobility ecosystem, our intent is to lead in the next generation development of motion management products, systems and solutions to engineer the ideal ride for any customer. 
Invest in applications that benefit from global light vehicle battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption
We continually assess our growth investment priorities. Industry forecasts project global light vehicle BEV penetration rates to increase steadily in the current decade. In response, we have prioritized investments in light vehicle product lines and applications that have content growth opportunities in light vehicle BEV and are agnostic to an anticipated increase in adoption rates.
Penetrate adjacent market segments
We seek to penetrate a variety of adjacent sales opportunities and achieve growth in higher-margin businesses by applying our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities. For example, we aggressively leverage our technology and engineering leadership in powertrain, clean air, ride performance and aftermarket into adjacent sales opportunities for commercial trucks, buses, agricultural equipment, construction machinery, and other vehicles in other regions around the world. 
We design and launch clean air products for commercial vehicle customers such as Caterpillar, for whom we are their global diesel clean air system integrator, John Deere, Navistar, Deutz, Daimler Trucks, Scania, Weichai Power, FAW Group, and Kubota. We also engineer and build modular NOx-reduction systems for large engines that meet standards of the International Maritime Organization, among others.
Aftermarket Specific Strategies
Our aftermarket business strategy incorporates a go-to-market model that we believe differentiates us from our competitors and creates structural support for sustained revenue growth. The model is designed to drive revenue growth by capitalizing on three of the company’s key competitive strengths: a leading portfolio of products and brands; extensive global manufacturing, distribution and service capabilities; and market intelligence gathered from the company’s distributors, installers and consumers. 
We expect this distinctive go-to-market model will result in a sustainable competitive advantage, particularly as the industry trends previously mentioned disrupt the traditional aftermarket landscape and business practices. We expect the demand for replacement parts to increase as a result of the increase in the average age of VIO and the increase in the average miles driven per year. The characteristics of aftermarket sales and distribution are defined regionally, which require localized strategies to address the key success factors of our customers. The key components of our aftermarket strategy are described below:
Leverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brand positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities for global growth
We are well-positioned to capitalize on aftermarket trends and expand in mature markets (e.g. North America, Europe, and Australia) as well as high-growth regions (i.e. China, South America, India, and Southeast and Northeast Asia). Important factors enabling our growth strategy include our brand strength, broad product portfolio and range, sales and marketing expertise, supply chain and distribution capability. In addition, we also strive to maintain very close relationships with our customers and help position them for success.
Our aftermarket business includes multiple leading brands with strong product offerings. Our portfolio includes the industry’s most well-respected and enduring brands. We will leverage our go-to-market model to build upon our brand strengths and grow our global aftermarket business by consistently delivering differentiated benefits, by growing our brand equity among our target end-customers, and by leveraging our broad product coverage and extensive distribution network. We are dedicated to being stewards of these brands and continually strengthening their equity through robust marketing programs. We are also focusing on leveraging our market connectivity to drive innovative solutions in both products and service to support or channel partners. 
Continue to strengthen our aftermarket capabilities and product offerings in mature markets, including North America and Europe
The scale of our aftermarket business allows for strong distribution channels that significantly enhance our go-to-market capabilities across mature markets in North America and Europe. We continually rationalize our already strong distribution networks with the goal of improved customer service at a lower cost. This is achieved by continually harnessing and leveraging market intelligence, and sharing information with our channel partners to drive best practices in go-to-market, manufacturing and distribution processes.
The North America and Europe go-to-market capabilities will be defined by positioning our distribution and installer partners for success. We believe this will require maintaining an extensive catalog of products to provide the ability to address customer requirements quickly and easily. Managing a large and complex catalog of products requires an understanding of the composition of the car parc within the regions including wear patterns, typical replacement rates based on weather, road quality, and average miles driven annually. These compositions differ significantly by region, which will affect the range and frequency of replacement part requirements. The understanding of these regional dynamics will help us provide the right parts when they are needed and achieve the industry’s best “Order to Delivery” times. We will continue to innovate product solutions that will be cost competitive and reliable, reduce install time, reduce the number of unique parts that installers need to inventory on-site, reduce the number of unique installer tools and equipment required, and improve installer safety. 
In addition to having a comprehensive product offering, we also strive to maintain very close relationships with our customers and help position them for success. We have launched a series of “Tech First” initiatives to provide online, on demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products in North America, Europe, and China and plan to expand into South America. This initiative included a network of Garage Gurus™ technical support centers that provide some of the most comprehensive training programs in the industry to educate our partners and customers with emerging vehicle technologies and vehicle repair operational skills. We believe it is key to our strategy to provide aftermarket parts that are simple to install and to make sure our customers have the resources to know how to install these parts properly. In having the right products and resources for our customers, we believe we will continue to be a preferred aftermarket supplier and continue to drive growth in the Americas and emerging economic areas.
Increase aftermarket position in high-growth regions, notably in Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific region, particularly the high-growth markets of China and India, presents a significant opportunity for us to expand our business. We have made investments in distribution and in our sales force in both China and the rest of Asia to help drive growth in this increasingly important region. We must take into account the different operational requirements in Asia Pacific in order to drive aftermarket growth in this region. 
The Asia Pacific light vehicle and commercial vehicle aftermarket industry is fragmented with a large number of small distributors and installers that require different strategies and solutions than more mature consolidated markets. Distribution in smaller volumes will require us to utilize a unique approach, as compared to the approach in mature markets, in order to compete on the basis of optimal “Order to Delivery” timeliness while maintaining a broad range of products.
Additionally, buying online is the preferred purchase method for many smaller distribution and installer partners. The sophistication of the existing online marketplaces in Asia Pacific will require us to develop adaptive and flexible omnichannel tools in order to compete effectively. We believe that developing a competitive online platform for our Asia Pacific customers will be the foundation for us to build a digital platform that will improve our competitiveness globally.

Human Capital Resources
Employees
Our employees set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 73,000 employees with approximately 42% located in the Americas, 39% located in EMEA and 19% located in China and Asia Pacific. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 53% of our employee base was covered by collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of two facilities in the U.S., most of our unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates and, as a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. Management believes that employee relations are favorable.
Safety, Health and Wellness
The health and safety of our employees and anyone who enters our workplace is of utmost importance to us. Our commitment to environmental, health and safety applies to all of our locations and all leadership levels within the organization. We utilize a robust tool kit of programs to achieve our health and safety goals. 
In 2020, we introduced a range of new safety protocols in our facilities in an effort to protect our employees and support appropriate health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19 and the global pandemic. Through the use of education and awareness, provision of necessary personal protective equipment, and changes to our manufacturing sites and screening, we strive to make our workplaces a safe place for employees during the workday. 
Creating a culture where all of our employees feel supported and valued is vital to Tenneco’s values. We strive to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our employees. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is critical to attract and retain employees, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. 
Inclusion and Diversity
At Tenneco, we embrace the unique needs of each geographical market — from customer requirements to team member cultures. We actively cultivate the diverse talents of our team and strive to recruit and maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate, which we believe enables better business decisions and rapid innovation. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training, in particular with respect to our policies against harassment in the workplace. 
We have made progress in inclusion and diversity through a variety of diverse partnerships and organizations. Additionally, in 2020, to drive further changes in inclusion and diversity, we commissioned an IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action) Board which partners with management to build a more robust inclusion and diversity strategy for the future. Tenneco’s IDEA Board is sponsored by the Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and is made up of members from the Company representing locations, functions and business segments across the globe.
Competitive Pay
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and to provide proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. We believe the structure of our compensation programs balance incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Further, we are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across the enterprise.
Talent Management
We have developed initiatives and opportunities to empower team members to progress their skill sets, focusing on tools and training to build capability and technical, professional and leadership skills throughout our organization, as well as use a progressive learning approach of “learn-do-lead” to develop our future leaders. We provide training programs in a variety of topics which cover both soft and technical skills. We also have supervisor development resources to continue to build tools for leaders to develop their teams on the job and in roles to create new opportunities to learn and grow. Core development programs are discussed in our Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report.
Team member engagement is critical to our success. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, Tenneco surveys employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and takes actions to understand our current engagement levels and to develop actions to address areas for improvement. 
Tenneco is also focused on completing talent and performance reviews. Our in-depth talent reviews serve to identify high potential talent to advance in roles with greater responsibility, assess learning and development needs, and establish and refresh succession plans for critical leadership roles across the enterprise. Our performance review process promotes transparent communication of team member performance, which we believe is a key factor in our success. The performance and the talent reviews enable ongoing assessments, reviews, and mentoring to identify career development and training opportunities for our employees. 
Raw Materials
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in our manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings, and forgings. We also purchase parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. The principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. We believe that an adequate supply of steel can presently be obtained from a number of different domestic and foreign suppliers. We address price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best cost countries, strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities, and aggressively negotiating with our customers to allow us to recover these higher costs from them.
Intellectual Property
We are the owner of a large number of U.S. and foreign country patents and trademarks relating to our products and businesses. We manufacture and distribute our aftermarket products and products sold directly to OE manufacturers under a number of trademarks that are well-recognized in the marketplace. The patents, trademarks and other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us are important in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of our products. The primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs, technologies, and products. However, we do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. While our current patents will expire in the normal course at various times between now and 2040, we continually develop new technologies and products and apply for and obtain new U.S. and foreign patents.
