Summary
 
B2Digital, Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 3, 2004. Historically, the Company had been a provider of in-room, on-demand video entertainment and satellite services to the domestic lodging industry. In the past, the Company had provided the video services to over 50,000 hotel rooms in the lodging industry. Pay-Per View (“PPV”) lost a great deal of market share due to the increased internet use by hotel guests. With this loss, the Company’s Board of Directors agreed to dissolve Hotel Movie Network on March 11, 2010.
 
In February 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a complete restructuring, new management team and strategic direction for the Company. Capitalizing on its history in television, video and technology, the Company is now forging ahead and becoming a full-service live event sports company.
 
Since the restructuring, the Company has been led by a management team headed by the Company’s Chairman and CEO, Greg P. Bell. The management team has over 30 years of global experience developing more than 20 companies in the sports, television, entertainment, digital distribution, and banking transaction industries. As part of its growth strategy, the Company intends to continue to develop and acquire assets meeting its business model with the goal of becoming a premier vertically-integrated live event sports company.
