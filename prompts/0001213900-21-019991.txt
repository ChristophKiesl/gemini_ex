ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 
Our primary business is the development of a portfolio of transdermal pharmaceutical products. Our lead product is our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system which we are developing to provide clinicians and patients with an extended-release transdermal fentanyl product for use in managing chronic pain requiring around the clock opioid therapy combined with our AVERSA® technology which we plan to show can reduce the abuse and misuse of fentanyl patches. We believe that AVERSA® can be broadly applied to various transdermal products and our strategy is to follow the development of our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system with the development of additional transdermal prescription products for pharmaceuticals that have risks or a history of abuse. In addition, we are developing a portfolio of transdermal pharmaceutical products to deliver commercially available drugs or biologics that are typically delivered by injection but with the potential to improve compliance and therapeutic outcomes.
 
Because of our financial position, we have put our development efforts with respect to these products on hold, and our only business is the performance of contract manufacturing and R&D services. The description of our business in this annual report is based on our ability to raise significant financing or enter into a joint venture agreement with a third party that has the financial ability to fund the joint venture’s operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or enter into a joint venture agreement on reasonable, if any, terms for the development of our prescription pipeline.
 
Through July 31, 2018, we had not generated any revenue from our business, which was the development of a range of transdermal consumer patches. Consumer products are products that can be sold over-the-counter and do not require a prescription. Most transdermal patches are considered drugs in the United States and cannot be marketed in the United States without approval from the FDA. We have not taken any steps to seek to obtain FDA approval for any of our consumer products, and we have no plans to do so in the near term.
 
We acquired 4P Therapeutics on August 1, 2018 for $2,250,000 consisting of 62,500 shares of common stock, valued at $1,850,000, cash of $400,000, and a 6% royalty on any revenues we generate or derive from the abuse deterrent intellectual property developed by 4P Therapeutics payable to Steve Damon, who has been one of our directors since April 2018 and who was the sole equity owner of 4P Therapeutics. As a result of the acquisition, the focus of our business has changed from the development and marketing of consumer transdermal products to the development of 4P Therapeutics’ portfolio of pharmaceutical transdermal system, with the lead product being the abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, AVERSA®.
 
We have received patent protection from the European Patent Office, the patent offices for Japan, Australia and Russia and and the patent office of Mexico has granted a notice of allowance for abuse deterrent transdermal technology patent used in our lead product, an abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system. The patent is being prosecuted in the United States and in other countries. The patent applications were filed by 4P Therapeutics prior to our acquisition of 4P Therapeutics and any patents issued in respect of these applications will be in the name of 4P Therapeutics. In addition to applying the technology to developing an abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, we believe that the abuse deterrent patch technology can be applied to other opioids and pain medication patches where there is a risk of abuse and overdose, as well as other transdermal pharmaceuticals where we believe our technology can help prevent abuse or accidental misuse.
 
Our lead product under development is our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system which we plan to develop to deter the abuse and accidental misuse of fentanyl transdermal patches. Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid that is marketed as a transdermal patch for chronic pain management. There are currently a number of generic fentanyl patches on the market but we believe that none of them are abuse deterrent. We believe that our abuse deterrent technology, AVERSA®, containing aversive agents will significantly deter the abuse and accidental misuse of fentanyl from transdermal patches. In 2017, according to a report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, of the more than 72,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States, nearly 30,000 occurred due to overdoses of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.
 
The development of our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system requires preclinical and clinical trials to be conducted for the purposes of obtaining FDA approval. We require funds for these trials.

With the acquisition of 4P Therapeutics, we acquired a pipeline of other transdermal products, including peptides and proteins such as exenatide for type 2 diabetes and FSH for infertility, which we anticipate will be the next products for development. These drugs are off-patent but are currently only available as injections, and we are evaluating the possibility of developing a transdermal delivery system for these drugs as an alternative to injection but with improved compliance and safety. In addition we may develop certain generic transdermal products where we think we can make an improvement to existing patches and where we believe we can take significant market share with good profit margins. One example of such a product candidate is the development of a generic scopolamine patch. The prioritization of our portfolio product candidates will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will take into account technical progress, market potential and commercial interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and obtain FDA approval for any of these potential products or that we can be successful in marketing any such products. The FDA approval process can take many years to complete successfully and we will require substantial funding for each product that goes through the process. We cannot assure you that we will obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our products.
 
Since 4P Therapeutics did not have any products that it can market, its sole source of revenue to date was derived from the performance of contract research and development and other services for a small number of clients in the life sciences field on an as-needed basis to support its ongoing operations. The work varied in nature and includes early stage drug and device preclinical studies, commercial biologic manufacturing support, clinical-regulatory consulting, drug or device clinical studies and formulation/analytical services relating to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls function of drug manufacturing. The current continuing arrangements are varied, from purchase order supported per animal study fees, to hourly rate research and development services, to flat rate contract research and development projects. Neither we nor current clients have any long-term commitments, and either party can terminate at any time. If we raise financing we intend to devote our efforts toward the development and testing of our lead product and other product candidates in our pipeline. However, for the near term, we are looking to perform research and development services for third parties although we do not expect to generate significant revenues from these services.
 
We have a distribution agreement dated April 13, 2018 with EMI-Korea (Best Choice), Inc., whom we refer to as Best Choice, for marketing in certain regions in Asia. Pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement, we granted Best Choice exclusive distribution rights for all of our transdermal consumer products in South Korea, Taiwan (the Republic of China), the People’s Republic of China and South Asia. We currently have no plans to market our own products in these regions and following our acquisition of Pocono Pharma we are primarily focused on contract manufacturing services for Best Choice and its partners. Best Choice is responsible for complying with all applicable regulations.
 
Acquisition of 4P Therapeutics
 
Pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated April 5, 2018 between us and 4P Therapeutics, on August 1, 2018, we acquired all of the equity interest in 4P Therapeutics from Steven Damon, the owner of 4P Therapeutics. The purchase price of $2,250,000, consisting of 62,500 shares of common stock, valued at $1,850,000, and cash of $400,000, and are to pay Mr. Damon a 6% royalty on any revenue we receive or derive from our utilization or sale of the abuse deterrent intellectual property that we acquired as a part of the assets 4P Therapeutics, including partner license milestones and development payments. The royalty is payable pursuant to the acquisition agreement and continues as long as we generate revenue from our utilization or sale of the abuse deterrent intellectual property we acquired as part of the acquisition of 4P Therapeutics. The 62,500 shares were issued to Mr. Damon (41,750 shares) and Dr. Alan Smith (20,750 shares). In connection with the acquisition, Mr. Damon retained any cash and accounts receivable and assumed any liabilities other than those relating to the ongoing business. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, we appointed Mr. Damon to our board of directors in April 2018, when we signed the acquisition agreement, and we agreed to pay Mr. Damon the compensation received by independent board members.
Acquisition of Pocono Coated Products
 
Effective August 31, 2020, the Company acquired from Pocono Coated Products (“PCP”), pursuant to which PCP agreed to sell the Company certain of the assets and liabilities associated with its Transdermal, Topical, Cosmetic and Nutraceutical business. Included in the transaction, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Active Intelligence LLC. The purchase price for the acquired assets was (i) $6,085,180 paid in shares of the Company’s common stock of Nutriband at a value of the average price of the previous 90 days at the date of Closing equal to 608,519 shares; (ii) a promissory note of the Company in the principal amount of $1,500,000, which is due upon the earlier of (a) twelve (12) months from issuance, or (b) immediately following a capital raise of not less than $4,000,000 and/or a public offering of no less than $4,000,000

Our corporate headquarters are located at 121 S. Orange Ave. Suite 1500, Orlando, Florida 32765, telephone (407) 377-6695. Our website is www.nutriband.com. Information contained on or available through our website or any other website does not constitute a portion of this annual report.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies, although as a smaller reporting company we are taking advantage of reduced reporting requirements. In particular, as an emerging growth company, we:

● | may present only two years of audited financial statements and related disclosure under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives, which is commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis”;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and chief executive officer pay ratio disclosure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not be required to conduct an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting by our auditors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions. However, since we have already adopted certain new or revised accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act, we are not able to take advantage of the delayed phase in of the new or revised accounting standards.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. The JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues (as adjusted for inflation), have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Under current Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules however, we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have either (i) a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million and a public float of less than $700 million.
 
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 
Our business may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to the pandemic. Factors which may affect our business include, but are not limited to, the following:

Pharmaceutical Products in Development
 
We have a pipeline of transdermal pharmaceutical products that are primarily in the early, preclinical, stages of development. Our pipeline consists primarily of drug compounds which have been previously approved by the FDA and are now off-patent. In many cases, we are developing the first non-injectable version of the drug utilizing our transdermal technology which represents a new route of administration. In most cases, we plan to utilize the 505(b) (2) regulatory pathway provided by the FDA which allows us to reference the safety information on file at FDA for the approved drug or to reference the published literature instead of having to generate new safety information that would typically be required for new chemical entities. However, we cannot assure you that the FDA will concur with our approach or that we will be able to receive FDA approval to market any of products that we develop.
 
Our lead product under development is our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system. As the United States faces an epidemic of opioid abuse, fentanyl transdermal patches have become an attractive target for recreational drug abusers due to the drug’s potency and its ease of abuse by the oral route. We are looking to utilize our proprietary approach to incorporate aversive agents into the transdermal patch to deter the abuse of fentanyl patches by the oral, buccal and inhaled routes, which represent as much as 70% of all transdermal fentanyl abuse. The technology is based on the incorporation of taste and sensory aversive agents into the patch. We believe that the aversive agents we selected have several advantages, such as their high potency, established safety, and the potential to prevent accidental misuse by children and pets. The aversive agents are formulated in a controlled-release matrix that is coated onto the backing of a transdermal fentanyl patch. The controlled release aspect of the technology is designed so that the abuse deterrent properties are maintained after normal use and during attempts to separate the aversive agents from the fentanyl. We believe that this structure provides maximum exposure during oral abuse and during attempts to extract the drug, while preventing exposure of the patient to the aversive agents during transdermal wear. We believe that a key differentiating aspect of the technology is that the aversive agents are physically separated from the drug matrix, meaning that the aversive agents do not have to be formulated in the fentanyl drug matrix and do not contact the skin. In addition to the fentanyl patch, this technology has broad applicability to any therapeutic patch where deterring abuse and accidental misuse by children and pets are valuable attributes.

We believe that our abuse deterrent technology can be broadly applied to various transdermal products and our strategy is to follow the development of our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system with the development of additional products for pharmaceuticals that have risks or history of abuse. For example, we believe that our technology can be utilized in other transdermal products to deter the abuse of other transdermal drugs such as buprenorphine, an opioid used to treat acute pain and chronic pain, and methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant.
 
Buprenorphine is an opioid used to treat opioid addiction, acute pain and chronic pain. It can be used under the tongue, by injection, as a skin patch, or as an implant. For opioid addiction, it is typically only started when withdrawal symptoms have begun and for the first two days of treatment under direct observation of a health care provider. For longer term treatment of addiction, a combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is recommended to prevent misuse by injection.
 
Methylphenidate, sold under various trade names, such as Ritalin in oral form, and in transdermal patch form known as Daytrana, is a central nervous system stimulant of the phenethylamine and Piperidine classes that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. We plan to follow up with transdermal delivery systems for buprenorphine and methylphenidate after we make significant progress on our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system.
 
We are also exploring product applications for our transdermal technology to deliver proteins and peptides such as exenatide for type 2 diabetes and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for infertility. Presently, these products are only available by injection or oral routes. We believe that transdermal delivery has the potential to improve compliance, which can lead to improved therapeutic outcomes associated with these treatments.
 
Exenatide (exendin-4) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist which is approved to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide is currently approved as a twice-daily subcutaneous injection or as a once-weekly injection. However, many patients have a strong aversion to needles, resist initiation of injections even when oral agents are failing to control their diabetes and struggle with compliance after starting therapy. We have performed pre-clinical work on the development of a novel transdermal patch for administration of exenatide to match the therapeutic plasma levels achieved by subcutaneous injections of exenatide. However, we need substantial funds before we can continue these efforts. In addition to being needle-free, painless and easy-to-use, our proposed exenatide transdermal system is being designed to incorporate compliance tracking to help providers improve patient outcomes. We believe that the development of an exenatide patch matching the profile of exenatide injections will follow the 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory pathway, thereby limiting the extent of safety and efficacy trials required for FDA approval, although we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree. Transdermal exenatide is currently in the preclinical phase of development.
 
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin, a glycoprotein polypeptide hormone that is synthesized and secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is indicated for the treatment of infertility in women and is currently only approved and marketed as a subcutaneous injection. FSH is mainly used for ovarian hyperstimulation as part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) regimen. There are several purified and recombinant FSH injections currently on the market. We are developing a novel transdermal patch to match the pharmacokinetic profile of FSH subcutaneous injection but without the need for painful injections. Transdermal FSH is intended to offer a painless, easy to use one-step application to improve patient compliance with FSH therapy. Transdermal FSH will be offered at multiple strengths to match the typical doses prescribed to treat infertility. We plan to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate that the transdermal patch can match the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous injection. Then we plan to conduct an irritation and sensitization study to demonstrate the skin safety of the product and a pivotal clinical efficacy trial to demonstrate that transdermal FSH is not inferior to subcutaneous injection. We intend to seek to utilize the 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory pathway to register the product with the FDA which allows us to reference the know safety of FSH on file at FDA for the reference listed drug and the safety information that has been published in the literature. We have not yet communicated with the FDA on our proposed development plan or registration plan and we cannot assure you that the FDA will agree to our use of the 505(b)(2) pathway. Transdermal FSH is currently in the preclinical phase of development.
 
In addition, we may seek to develop certain generic transdermal products where we think we can efficiently make an improvement to existing patches and potentially take significant market share with good profit margins. One example of such a product candidate is the development of a generic scopolamine patch.
 
- 5 -

 

Transdermal scopolamine (Transderm Scop®) was developed in the 1970s by Alza Corporation for Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis) for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and recovery from anesthesia and surgery. The product was approved as the first modern transdermal therapeutic system by the FDA in 1979. A generic transdermal scopolamine product was approved in 2015 (Perrigo) but was not marketed until 2017. As of November 2018, there was only one generic transdermal scopolamine approved and marketed. We are looking to develop what we believe is an improved proprietary generic scopolamine patch. Product improvements include enhancements to the manufacturing processes to reduce the manufacturing cost and optimization of the adhesive formulation to reduce cold flow and increase patient acceptability. We have performed pre-clinical work on this proposed product, however, we cannot proceed further without significant funding. We plan to follow the FDA guidance on the product development of a generic transdermal scopolamine patch and plan on utilizing the ANDA regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for marketing. Transdermal scopolamine is currently in the preclinical phase of development.
 
We have not yet determined which product we will seek to develop after our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system. The prioritization of our portfolio of product candidates will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will take into account technical progress, market potential, available funding and commercial interest. Our ability to take any meaningful steps to the development of any of these products is determined by our ability to provide sufficient funding for such purchase. As stated above, without significant financing or a joint venture agreement we will not be able to take any steps to the development of any of these products.
 
We currently have no branded OTC or Consumer products nor do we plan to launch any OTC or Consumer products in the near term as our focus is primarily on our prescription pipeline and contract services offered by both 4P Therapeutics and Pocono Pharma.
 
Manufacturing of our pharmaceutical transdermal products will be performed for clinical trials during the development program and for manufacturing of commercial products prior to FDA approval and for sales and marketing. Clinical manufacturing for our early stage clinical trials will most likely be performed at our facilities at 4P Therapeutics. However, the manufacture of clinical products for later stage pivotal clinical trials and for commercial manufacturing may either be done by contract manufacturers or done in our commercial facilities. Manufacture of clinical and commercial product will be performed in compliance with current FDA Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP) and all applicable local regulations. All manufacturing processes will be subject to review by the FDA during development, prior to approval and during subsequent routine FDA inspections.
 
On December 9, 2020, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Rambam Med-Tech Ltd., Haifa, Israel (“RamBam”), for us to develop the RAMBAM Closed System Transfer Device (CSTD) the (“Medical Products”). As a part of the transaction with RamBam for the License Agreement, and to assist in the development of the RAMBAM CSTD Device, on March 10, 2021, the Company finalized a Distribution Agreement (“Distribution Agreement”)_with BPM Inno Ltd., Kiryat, Israel (“BPM”), providing for distribution of the Medical Products developed and produced under the License Agreement and a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), dated December 7, 2020, providing for the purchase by BPM of 81,396 shares of common stock at a price of $8.60 per share, or $700,000. The investment by BPM in our common stock under the SPA was completed on February 26, 2021. Under the Distribution Agreement, BPM has the right to distribute the Medical Products in Israel and has a right of first refusal in relation to all other countries/states, other than United States, Korea, China, Vietnam, Canada and Ecuador, which are termed excluded countries.
 
Employees
 
As of January 1, 2021, we had five employees, all of which are officers of the Company, and three of which are full-time and two of which are currently part-time. We also engage one consultant who provides services on a part-time basis. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Government Regulation
 
United States
 
The pharmaceutical business is subject to extensive government regulation. In the United States, we must comply with the rules and regulations of the FDA. In other countries we must comply with the laws and regulations of each country to legally market and sell our products. Obtaining FDA approval does not mean that the product will be approved in other countries. Each country may require that additional clinical and nonclinical studies be conducted prior to approval.

The process required by the FDA to receive approval prior to marketing and distributing a drug in the United States generally involves the following. The definition of drug is broadly defined, and includes our pharmaceutical products and most of our consumer transdermal patches. Even though the drug used in each of our proposed products is currently approved by the FDA in oral or injectable dosage forms, we will still need to conduct a full development program including preclinical and clinical trials before we receive FDA marketing approval. The FDA also has a number of abbreviated approval pathways which, if we are eligible, could shorten the time for approval. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to use any abbreviated approval pathway, in which event we will need to comply with the full regulatory pathway.
 

● | Preclinical phase. Before a drug company can test an experimental treatment in humans, it must prove the drug is safe and effective in animals. Scientists run tests in various animals before presenting the data to the FDA as an investigational new drug application. For already approved drugs, an animal study may not be required prior to testing in humans. In most cases, the company must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to get clearance to test the product in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase one clinical trial. In the first round of clinical trials, the drug company attempts to establish the drug’s safety in humans. Drug researchers administer the treatment to healthy individuals — instead of patients suffering from the disease or condition the drug is intended to treat — and gradually increase the dose to see if the drug is toxic at higher levels or if any possible side effects occur. These drug trials are usually small, containing about 20 to 80 participants, according to the FDA. For drug delivery products incorporating already approved drugs, Phase 1 studies involve measuring blood levels of the drug to understand the pharmacokinetics for a new route of administration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase two clinical trial. In the second round of clinical trials, researchers give the treatment to patients who have the disease to assess the drug’s efficacy. The trial is randomized, meaning half of the study participants receive the drug and half receive a placebo. These trials usually contain hundreds of participants, according to the FDA. There is about a 30 percent chance of a drug moving on to a phase three clinical trial, according to data from the biotech trade organization BIO. For already approved drugs, as is the case with drug delivery products, a Phase 2 trial may not be necessary as the therapeutic drug doses and blood concentrations are already known. However, a Phase 2 may be conducted to inform the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial in regards to the safety and efficacy of the product when used by patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase three clinical trial. In the third phase of clinical trials, researchers work with the FDA to design a larger trial to test the drug’s ideal dosage, patient population and other factors that could decide whether the drug is approved, according to the report. These trials usually contain a few hundred to thousands of participants. In the case of drug delivery products that utilize an approved drug, Phase 3 trials will typically include a comparison to the already approved reference product. For example a transdermal patch may be compared to an injection.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New drug application. Once a drug company collects and analyzes all data from the clinical trials, it submits a new drug application to the FDA. The application includes trial data, preclinical information and details on the drug’s manufacturing process. If the FDA accepts the application for review, the agency has ten months — or six months if the drug has priority review status — to make a decision, according to the report. The FDA can hold an advisory committee meeting where independent experts assess the data and recommend whether to approve the drug. From there, the FDA will either approve the drug or give the applicant a complete response letter, which explains why the drug did not get approved and what steps the applicant must take before resubmitting the application for approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA may also require Human Abuse Liability or Human Abuse Potential clinical studies to evaluate the abuse liability or abuse potential of a new chemical entity for drugs that affect the central nervous system. If the abuse deterrent technology renders a product less desirable than conventional formulations, it is said to convey abuse deterrent properties and can include specific label language indicating this difference.
 
In other instances, sponsors are required to evaluate the effectiveness of an Abuse Deterrent Formulation. For Abuse Deterrent Formulation trials, the objective is to assess the ability of the new formulation to be tampered with and abused, and is often pursuant to a 505(b)(2) strategy.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities where the product is being manufactured or facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process and will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing processes is satisfactory. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. In pursuing FDA approval there may be various delays and it is possible that approval may never be granted. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
If a product is approved, the FDA may impose limitations on the indications for use for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies or trials be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or impose other limitations.
 
Once a product receives FDA approval, marketing the product for other indicated uses or making certain manufacturing or other changes related to the product will require FDA review and approval of a supplemental NDA or a new NDA, which may require additional clinical safety and efficacy data and may require additional review fees. In addition, further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product may be required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing.
 
With respect to the labeling for our abuse deterrent transdermal fentanyl system or any other opioid transdermal patch we develop, it is likely that we will need to disclose the risks of improper use or abuse using language required by the FDA.
 
FDA Approval Pathways
 
The FDA has several pathways that can be followed to obtain FDA approval.
 

● | A stand-alone NDA is an application submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and approved under Section 505(c) of the FD&C Act that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. This is typically the pathway used for new chemical entities.

● | A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) and approved under Section 505(c) of the FD&C Act that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. This is the pathway typically taken for off-patent drugs that are being development into alternate dosage forms or routes of administration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An ANDA is an application for a duplicate of a previously approved drug product that was submitted and approved under Section 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An ANDA relies on the FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug product is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the proposed generic product (1) is the same as the drug with respect to the active ingredients, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength and labeling (with certain permissible differences) and (2) is bioequivalent to the referenced drug. An ANDA may not be submitted if studies are necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. This is the pathway taken for generic drugs.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of any of the available abbreviated approval pathways for any of our proposed products.

Post-approval requirements
 
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. Certain requirements include, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” and other promotional activities, such as those considered to be false or misleading. Failure to comply with FDA regulations can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Such enforcement may also lead to scrutiny and enforcement by other government and regulatory bodies.
 
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not encourage, market or promote such off-label uses. As a result, “off-label promotion” has formed the basis for litigation under the Federal False Claims Act, violations of which are subject to significant civil fines and penalties. In addition, manufacturers of prescription products are required to disclose annually to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare any payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S. under the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Reportable payments may be direct or indirect, in cash or kind, for any reason, and are required to be disclosed even if the payments are not related to the approved product. Failure to fully disclose or not in time reporting could lead to penalties up to $1.15 million per year.
 
The manufacturing of any of our products will be required to comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing process (cGMP) regulations. These regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register with the FDA their establishments and list any products they make and to comply with related requirements in certain states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing processes and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions may include recalls, suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, and continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a “consent decree,” which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, or Phase IV testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of our products.
 
Other Government Regulations
 
We are subject to government regulations that are applicable to businesses generally, including those relating to workers’ health and safety, environmental and waste disposal, wage and hour and labor practices, including sexual harassment laws and regulations, and anti-discrimination laws and regulations.
 
In addition, we must comply with the laws and regulations governing the research and manufacture of products containing controlled substances such as fentanyl and other opioids. We must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the state(s) in which we conduct research and development activities. We currently hold a DEA license and a Georgia State Board of Pharmacy license to support our current research activities at our facility in Georgia. As a result we have been inspected by the DEA and the Georgia Board of Pharmacy. As we enter the manufacturing phase of development we will need to obtain a DEA manufacturing license and a Georgia Board of Pharmacy manufacturing license and obtain production quota from the DEA to allocate sufficient amounts of controlled substances to us to conduct our development program. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient production quota from the DEA to support our manufacturing operations.

Europe and Other Countries
 
If we market our products in any countries other than the United States, we would be subject to the laws of those countries. In order to obtain market our products in other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our products.
 
The European medicines regulatory system is based on a network of around 50 regulatory authorities from the 31 countries in the European Economic Area, the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency. All medicines must be authorized before they can be placed on the market in the European Union. The European system offers different routes for authorization. A centralized procedure allows the marketing of a medicine on the basis of a single European Union assessment and marketing authorization which is valid throughout the European Union. However, a majority of medicines authorized in the European Union do not fall within the scope of the centralized procedure, and we do not know whether our proposed products will fall within the centralized authorization. We also do not know how the withdrawal of Great Britain from the European Union will affect the procedure for approval of medicines in the United Kingdom. If we are not able to use the centralized procedure, we would need to use one of the following procedures. One method is the decentralized procedure where we would apply for the simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union member. The second method is the mutual-recognition procedure where we would have a medicine authorized in one European Union country apply for authorization to be recognized in other European Union countries. In either case, we would be required to complete clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medicine and show and that the medicine is manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice based upon European Union standards.
 
In countries other than the United States and the European Union, we would be required to comply with the applicable laws of those countries, which may require us to perform additional clinical testing.
 
Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in those countries. In order to market and sell our products in jurisdictions other than the United States and the European Union, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and the European Union generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA and European Union approval, but can involve additional testing.
 
In addition, in many countries worldwide, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Even if we were to receive approval in the United States or the European Union, approval by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Similarly, approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States would not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in other foreign jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of those product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.
 
Outside the United States, particularly in member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations or the successful completion of health technology assessment procedures with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Certain countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor the pricing.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, if we market outside of the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
4P Therapeutics filed an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty for worldwide prosecution of the abuse deterrent transdermal technology patent used in our lead product, an abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system. The patent is being prosecuted in the United States and in other countries. The European Patent Office and the patent offices for Japan, Australia and Russia had granted patent protection for the patent application filed by 4P Therapeutics for its abuse deterrent transdermal technology and the patent office of Mexico has granted a notice of allowance. In addition to applying the technology to developing an abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, we believe that the abuse deterrent patch technology can be applied to other opioids and pain medication patches where there is risk of abuse and overdose, as well as other transdermal pharmaceuticals where we believe our technology can help prevent abuse or accidental misuse.
 
We have received a trademark and Wordmark for the name Nutriband. We have also received a trademark for the name AVERSA® which we use for our abuse deterrent technology.
 
Competition
 
Since our proposed pharmaceutical products deliver a drug which is off patent and presently available, we will compete with a number of companies who are presently selling the drug which is generally taken by injection. In addition, there are a number of companies that market generic transdermal patches, including fentanyl transdermal patches, and we will compete against those companies that make products with the same drug. Further, as transdermal patches become more popular, other companies, many of which have significantly greater resources and existing relationships with physicians and medical personnel, may use their resources to develop improved transdermal delivery systems for the drugs that are in our pipeline. We believe that competition is based on such factors as price, insurance/Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates and policies, safety and efficacy, side effects or reduction in side effects and the reliability of the supplier or manufacturer. Since we are developing our products to meet the needs of the patients, physicians, and the payers, we need to demonstrate advantages in terms of safety, efficacy, compliance and cost. If we obtain regulatory approval to market our products, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the marketplace.
