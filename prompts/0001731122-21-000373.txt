Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a rapidly growing homebuilder focused on providing High Performance Homes that deliver energy efficient living in highly attractive geographies. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, we primarily engage in the design, construction, marketing and sale of suburban and urban single-family detached and attached homes in California, Arizona and Metro New York. While we offer a wide range of properties, we primarily focus on entry-level and first-time move-up homes. We maintain a conservative capital structure and we believe our markets are characterized by attractive long-term housing fundamentals.
 
Building on the global homebuilding experience and environmentally focused strategy of Landsea Green Properties Co., Ltd. (Landsea Green), who indirectly owns 100% of our largest stockholder Landsea Holdings, we are driven by a pioneering commitment to sustainability. Drawing on new-home innovation and technology, including a partnership with a leading technology company, we are focused on sustainable, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly building practices that result in a lighter environmental impact, lower resource consumption and a reduced carbon footprint. The three pillars of our High Performance Homes platform are home automation, energy efficiency and sustainability. These pillars are reflected in such features as WiFi mesh networking, smart light switches, smart door locks, smart thermostats, WiFi garage door openers; LED lighting and upgraded insulation. Our efficient home designs help reduce lumber, concrete and building material waste on our jobsites.
 
Our communities are positioned in attractive markets like California and Arizona that, based on market conditions like low new home supply levels and high levels of employment relative to permits, are poised for growth. We are also prudently evaluating opportunities in new regional markets in which there is high demand and favorable population and employment growth as a result of proximity to job centers or primary transportation corridors. We are committed to achieving among the highest standards in design, quality and customer satisfaction and are a leader among our peers on several key operating and homebuilding metrics.
 
We have developed several award-winning master-planned communities. We have been recognized locally and nationally for our communities, including as recipient of the OC Registers Best Home Builder and Best New Home Community awards and placing in the top 3% of all homebuilders for positive customer experience in Eliant Homebuyers survey.
 
While we have construction expertise across a wide array of product offerings, we are focused on entry-level and first-time move-up homes. Additionally, we believe our high concentration in entry-level homes positions us to meet changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. In addition, our attached and higher density product in certain markets enables us to keep our entry-level price point attainable and within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that bringing attainable housing product helps to offset rising land and home costs and support our expansion into densely populated markets.
 
Landsea Homes home sales revenue has grown rapidly from approximately $29 million in 2017 to $735 million in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes owned or controlled almost 6,700 lots, of which more than 2,400 lots were under land option contracts or purchase contracts and more than 4,200 lots were owned. We believe that this represents approximately 3 to 4 years of supply under our current growth plan. We seek to invest in land inventory that we can efficiently develop over a 24-to-36-month horizon in order to maximize our returns on capital and minimize our exposure to market risk. We continue to evaluate new communities and to develop an attractive pipeline of land acquisition opportunities.
 
In California, Landsea Homes owned and controlled almost 1,800 lots as of December 31, 2020 in the high-demand San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties.
 
In Arizona, Landsea Homes owned and controlled more than 4,800 lots as of December 31, 2020. Since entering the Arizona market less than two years ago, Landsea Homes has acquired several communities organically in addition to two Phoenix-based homebuilders. In June 2019, Landsea Homes acquired Pinnacle West Homes (Pinnacle West), a homebuilder focused in the Phoenix market. In January 2020, Landsea Homes acquired Garrett Walker Homes (Garrett Walker), a leading homebuilder and brand also in the metropolitan Phoenix area that boasts a management team with decades of combined homebuilding experience. These acquisitions expanded our portfolio and breadth in the Arizona market. As a result of these acquisitions, we have become one of the largest homebuilders in Arizona.

In Metro New York, after giving effect to the Distribution (as defined below), Landsea Homes owned 50 lots as of December 31, 2020 related to one project in Manhattan, and almost 40 lots within LS-NJ Port Imperial Member, LLC (the Avora JV), an unconsolidated joint venture.
 
Net new home orders for Landsea Homes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were approximately 1,900 and 480, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes delivered more than 1,500 homes for total home sales revenue of $735 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Landsea Homes delivered nearly 600 homes for total home sales revenue of $569 million.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average selling price (ASP) of homes delivered was approximately $481,000 and $953,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Landsea Homes had a backlog of 750 and 121 sold but unclosed homes, respectively with an associated sales value of $389 million and $84 million. The average selling price of homes in backlog as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was approximately $519,000 and $694,000, respectively.
 
Metro New York
 
On June 30, 2020, Landsea Homes effectuated a distribution (the Distribution), pursuant to which Landsea Urban LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Landsea Homes, distributed 100% of its membership interests in LS-212 West 93 Member LLC (the 212 Project Entity) to Landsea Holdings. The 212 Project Entity owns 20 condo units in Manhattan that are currently under construction. The total assets, liabilities, and equity of the 212 Project Entity as of the date of Distribution were $50 million, $21 million and $29 million, respectively.
 
We are currently a joint venture partner in LS-14 Ave JV LLC (the 14th Street JV), that has a development project located at 14th Street and 6th Ave., New York (the 14th Street Project). The 14th Street JV is 95.89% held by us and owns 50 condo units and a retail space in Manhattan that are currently under construction and nearing top off.
 
We are currently a joint venture partner in the Aurora JV, that has a development project located on the New Jersey Gold Coast in the city of Weehawken (the Avora Project). The Avora JV is 51% held by us and owns 39 condo units, of which 35 were unsold as of December 31, 2020.
 
Our Markets
 
We operate in three primary markets: California, Arizona and Metro New York. The following table sets forth homebuilding revenue from each of these markets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018
Arizona (1) | $ | 320,691 | | $ | 40,024 | | $ | - 
California (2) | | 413,917 | | | 528,848 | | | 347,828
Metro New York (3) | | - | | | - | | | - 
 | $ | 734,608 | | $ | 568,872 | | $ | 347,828

 
(1)       The Arizona market consists primarily of entry-level, single-family homes in Goodyear, Buckeye, Chandler, Mesa, Avondale, Tolleson, Queen Creek and Phoenix counties in Arizona.
  2

 
(2)       The California market consists of single-family detached and attached homes in (i) Marin, Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Alameda counties in Northern California and (ii) Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties in Southern California.
 
(3)       The Metro New York market consists of two condominium projects in premier locations: Chelsea, New York and Weehawken, New Jersey along the gold coast. The Avora Project in Weehawken is an unconsolidated joint venture.
 
These markets are generally characterized by high job growth and increasing populations, creating strong demand for new housing, and we believe they represent attractive homebuilding markets with opportunities for long-term growth. Moreover, our management team has deep local market knowledge of the California and Arizona homebuilding and development industries. We believe this experience and strong relationships with local market participants enable us to efficiently source, entitle and close on land.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world caused significant volatility in the U.S. market beginning in early 2020. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy. The homebuilding industry was impacted by COVID-19, which saw reduced levels of orders and deliveries primarily in March, April and May 2020, with partial recovery beginning in June 2020.
 
During the first and second quarters of 2020, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for many markets across the United States, we experienced meaningful increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders, particularly in California and New York. However, as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders began to be lifted, our pace of sales increased and our cancellation rate returned to normal levels. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we had almost 600 home deliveries and home sales revenues of $284.7 million, as compared to less than 300 home deliveries and home sales revenues of $136.3 million in the first quarter of 2020, less than 250 home deliveries and home sales revenues of $95.1 million in the second quarter of 2020, and more than 400 home deliveries and home sales revenues of $218.5 million in the third quarter of 2020.
 
We believe the increase in demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from mid-March through early April, which caused some pent-up demand. We were and remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory.
 
In response to the pandemic and government restrictions, we implemented new operating measures relating to our sales, construction and other operations. Under these measures, we shifted our sales process to offer additional virtual online tours and appointments and, where permitted, appointment-only, in-person meetings intended to comply with social distancing and other health and safety requirements and protocols. We have also instituted social distancing, hygiene and sanitation guidelines in accordance with recommended protocols throughout the organization. We have encouraged employees at our corporate and division offices whose duties could be performed from home to work remotely, and we have implemented flexible schedules for employees that are permitted by applicable government orders or guidelines to be back in our corporate and division offices to limit the number of individuals in our offices on a given day. We have also encouraged our employees to use our virtual working and communication platforms in lieu of holding in-person meetings whenever possible.
 
Construction and sale of residential real estate has been determined to be an essential business in many of the regions in which we operate, and accordingly our operations, other than in certain markets during March and April 2020, have been exempted from certain health orders. There is still uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation has continued to evolve, and associated government and consumer responses have remained in a state of flux, especially in light of recent spikes in infections in key markets and the rollout of vaccines. In addition, because the full magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and difficult to predict, changes in our cash flow projections may change our conclusions on the recoverability of inventory in the future.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Our primary business objective is to create long-term, above industry average returns for our stockholders through our commitment to securing growth-oriented land positions, imposing strong operational discipline and control and providing High Performance Homes to our customers. We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from other public company homebuilders and position us well to execute our business strategy and capitalize on opportunities across our footprint:
Attractive Land Positions Focused on High Growth
 
We have positioned our business to strategically grow by selecting markets with favorable population and employment growth as a result of proximity to job centers or primary transportation corridors. Currently, we are focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative single-family detached and attached homes in planned communities in major metropolitan areas in California and Arizona. Additionally, we plan to evaluate opportunities in other markets opportunistically.
 
Generally, we believe that we have strong land positions strategically located within our core markets. We select communities in markets across the United States with high demand and convenient access to metropolitan areas that are generally characterized by a robust local economy and continued job growth, attraction of new residents and opportunities for potential homebuyers.

Strong Operational Discipline and Controls
 
Our management team possesses significant operating expertise, gleaned from its experiences with much larger public homebuilders. The perspective gained from that experience has helped shape the strict discipline and hands-on approach with which we are managed. From real-time dashboard updates on each project to monthly operating committee review and financial accountability at the project management level, our strict operating discipline is a key part of our strategy to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
High Performance Homes
 
We are committed to sustainability. We place heavy emphasis on environmental protection and are committed to delivering comfortable and eco-friendly residential properties to the market. Landsea Green has received numerous awards and recognition for various properties and enjoys broad recognition among its customers as one of the few brand names representative of eco-friendly building design and construction.
 
We are committed to sustainable building practices and conduct a multitude of energy-efficient, sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices that result in a lighter environmental impact, lower resource consumption and a reduced carbon footprint.
 
In 2019, Landsea Homes officially launched a High Performance Homes program in select communities across California and Arizona. The new program focuses on home automation, sustainability and energy savings, three factors that we believe are highly desired by our customers.
 
As part of the High Performance Homes program, we have established a partnership with a leading technology company. High Performance Homes utilize such companys proprietary software, which offers home automation options through applications on homebuyers mobile phones. Smart home automation options include a media manager device, MeshNet wireless internet throughout the home, entry door locks, thermostat control, garage door opener control, light dimmer switches, doorbell camera pre-wire and high-touch customer service with an individualized training session.

In addition, each High Performance Home includes upgraded roof insulation, upgraded wall insulation, upgraded floor insulation, more efficient mechanical systems, ENERGY STAR® rated appliances and LED lighting. The cost-in-use features lower homebuyers monthly bills and are intended to encourage environmental awareness and stewardship.
 
Our Growth Strategies
 
Building upon our success to date, we see a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth across our business by executing on the following growth strategies:
 
Strategy and Lot Position
 
Landsea Homes owned approximately 4,200 lots and had options to purchase an additional 2,400 lots, approximately, as of December 31, 2020. We intend to continue to utilize our current inventory of lots and future land acquisitions to conduct our operating strategy, which consists of:

● | converting our lot supply into active projects;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | maximizing revenue at communities;
--+-----------------------------------


● | maintaining a low cost structure;
--+----------------------------------


● | acquiring land positions through disciplined acquisition strategies in key markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | leveraging an experienced management team;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | gaining access to growth capital while keeping a conservative leverage profile; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generating positive cash flows.
--+--------------------------------

Acquire Attractive Land Positions While Reducing Risk
 
We believe that our reputation and extensive relationships with land sellers, master plan developers, financial institutions, brokers and other builders will enable us to continue to acquire well-positioned land parcels in our target markets. Before contracting to acquire land, we complete our land acquisition process, which consists of performing due diligence, reviewing the status of entitlements to mitigate zoning and other development risk and focusing on land as a component of a homes cost structure, rather than on the lands speculative value.
 
We believe that our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target customers expectations, while operating at competitive costs. We also seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, as well as the use of land options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements.
 
We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand in our existing and target markets, and we continually review our selection of markets based on both aggregate demographic information and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to reallocate our investments to maximize our profitability and return on capital over a two to three year timeframe. Our growth strategy will focus on increasing our market position in our existing markets and exploring expansion into other markets through organic growth or acquisitions.
 
Offer a Diverse Range of Products with a Focus on Entry-Level and First Move-Up
 
While our construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeal to a broad range of potential homebuyers, we are currently focused on entry-level and first-time move-up homes. We believe our high concentration in entry level and first-time move-up homes positions us to meet changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. In addition, our attached and higher density product in certain markets enables us to keep our entry-level price point attainable and within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that bringing attainable housing products helps to counter rising land and home costs and support our expansion into densely populated markets.
  5

 
We spend extensive time studying and designing our products through the use of architects, consultants and homeowner focus groups in our target markets. Our focus on entry-level and first-time move-up homes is a part of our pyramid strategy in which the largest ratio of communities of entry level homes forms the base of the pyramid, followed by first move-up and second move-up. At the top of the pyramid are our luxury homes that are the lowest in count and most selective in opportunistic locations.
 
 Focus on Efficient Cost Structure and Target Attractive Returns
 
We believe that our homebuilding platform and focus on controlling costs position us well to generate attractive returns for our investors. Our experienced management team is vigilant in maintaining its focus on controlling costs. We competitively bid each phase of development while maintaining strong relationships with our trade partners by managing production schedules closely and paying our vendors on time.
 
We combine decentralized management in those aspects of our business where we believe detailed knowledge of local market conditions is critical (such as governmental processing, construction, land development, accounts payable and sales and marketing), with centralized management in those functions where we believe central control is required (such as approval of land acquisitions, financial, treasury, human resources and legal matters). We have also made significant investments in systems and infrastructure to operate our business efficiently and to support our planned future growth as a result of executing our expansion strategy.
 
Description of Projects and Communities Under Development
 
The following table presents project information relating to each of Landsea Homes homebuilding markets as of December 31, 2020 and includes certain information that is forward-looking or predictive in nature and is based on expectations and projections about future events. Such information is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecast in the table below. 

 | Backlog (1) | | Lots Owned or Controlled (2) | | Homes Closed for Year Ended December 31, 2020 | Estimated Average Sales Price Range (3)
---------------+-------------+---------+------------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------
California | $ | 216,410 | | 1,766 | | 423 | $ | 979
Arizona | | 172,932 | | 4,864 | | 1,104 | | 290
Metro New York | | - | | 50 | | - | | 
GRAND TOTALS | $ | 389,342 | | 6,680 | | 1,527 | $ | 481

 
(1)       Backlog consists of homes sold under sales contracts that have not yet delivered, and there can be no assurance that delivery of sold homes will occur.
 
(2)       Lots owned or controlled as of December 31, 2020 include lots in backlog. Certain lots controlled are under land banking arrangements which will become owned and begin producing deliveries during 2021. Actual homes at completion may change prior to the marketing and sales of homes in these projects and the sales price ranges for these projects are to be determined and will be based on current market conditions and other factors upon the commencement of active selling. There can be no assurance that we will acquire any of the controlled lots reflected in these amounts.
 
(3)       Estimated average sales price range reflects historical actuals for delivered homes and current pricing estimates for homes not yet delivered and might not be indicative of future pricing. Further, any potential benefit to be gained from an increase in sales prices as compared to previously estimated amounts may be offset by increases in costs, selling commissions and other factors.
 
Pending Acquisitions
  6

 
As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes had options to acquire or were under contract to acquire land for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $257.6 million (net of deposits) on which it expects to build almost 2,500 homes in approximately 20 new communities in California and Arizona. As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes had paid $32.0 million in deposits relating to these pending acquisitions of which $31.0 million was nonrefundable.
Acquisition Process
 
As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes owned or controlled approximately 60 communities containing almost 6,700 lots under various stages of development. We believe that our current inventory of owned and controlled lots and lots under land option or purchase contracts will be adequate to supply our homebuilding operations for approximately three to four years.
 
Our acquisition strategy focuses on the development of entitled parcels that we can complete within approximately two to three years from the start of sales in order to reduce development and market cycle risk while maintaining an inventory of owned lots and lots under land option or purchase contracts sufficient for construction of homes over a three to four-year period. Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps to reduce development and market cycle risk:
 

1. | review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title review;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | limitation on the size of an acquisition to minimize investment levels in any one project;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | completion of due diligence on the land parcel and/or holding entity prior to committing to the acquisition;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | preparation of detailed budgets for all cost categories;
---+---------------------------------------------------------


5. | completion of environmental reviews and third-party market studies;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | utilization of options, joint ventures, mergers, equity purchases and other acquisition arrangements, if necessary; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | employment of centralized control of approval over all acquisitions through a land committee process.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Before purchasing a land parcel or entity, we also engage outside consultants to help review our proposed acquisition and design our homes and communities.
 
We acquire land parcels pursuant to purchase agreements, many of which are structured as option contracts. Such option contracts require us to pay non-refundable deposits, which can vary by transaction, and entitle (but do not obligate) us to acquire the land typically at fixed prices. The term within which we can exercise our option varies by transaction and the acquisition is often contingent upon the completion of entitlement or other work with regard to the land (which often include backbone improvements, such as the installation of main roads or sewer mains). Depending upon the transaction, we may be required to purchase all of the land subject to the option at once or we may have a right to acquire identified groups of lots over a specified timetable. In some transactions, a portion of the consideration that we pay for the land may be in the form of a profit share, which would be triggered upon exceeding an agreed-upon level of profit. In limited instances such as where we acquire land from a master developer that is part of a larger project, the seller may have repurchase rights entitling it to repurchase the land if we do not develop the land by an outside deadline (unless the delay is caused by certain circumstances outside our control) or seek to sell the land directly to a third party or indirectly through a change in control. Repurchase rights typically allow the seller to repurchase the land at our acquisition cost plus the cost of improvements made to the land and less a specified discount.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market homes through the extensive use of advertising and other promotional activities, including our website (www.landseahomes.com), in-house sales teams, mass-media advertisements, brochures, direct mail and the placement of signboards in the immediate areas of developments.
 
We normally build, decorate, furnish and landscape model homes for each product line and maintain on-site sales offices, which typically are open seven days a week. We believe that model homes and sales offices play a particularly important role in our marketing efforts. Consequently, we expend a significant amount of effort to create an attractive atmosphere at our model homes and tailor the exteriors and interiors of each home to coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers.
  7

 

We employ in-house commissioned sales personnel and occasionally outside brokers to sell our homes. In-house sales personnel typically work from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes and the selection of options. Sales personnel are licensed by the applicable real estate bodies in their respective markets, are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market.
 
We also offer a virtual sales experience, which provides potential home shoppers with a you are here experience that combines a variety of online tools, including 360° virtual tours, photo galleries, videos, interactive floor plans, site maps and local area maps. We employ a team of dedicated inside sales counselors who support all division and community web leads, phone calls, and on-site appointments, seven (7) days a week. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes virtual sales team managed almost 3,000 on-site appointments, 1,900 net orders, 39,000 direct phone calls, and 836,000 unique web users.
 
Our residences are typically sold before or during construction through sales contracts accompanied by a small cash deposit. Such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyers ability to qualify for financing. The cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow at Landsea Homes was approximately 12.7% during 2020 and 12.4% during 2019. Cancellations are caused by a variety of factors beyond our control such as a buyers change in ability to secure financing over time, individual life changing events, or overall economic market conditions.
 
In addition, our High Performance Homes are equipped with a proprietary software from a leading technology company, which offers home automation features through applications on homebuyers mobile phones. Such software comprises a significant portion of the High Performance Homes program, which is central to our marketing strategy.
 
Customer Financing
 
We seek to assist our homebuyers in obtaining financing by arranging with certain preferred mortgage lenders to offer qualified buyers a variety of financing options. These arrangements with preferred mortgage lenders are informal and non-binding. Unlike other homebuilders, we do not offer residential mortgages or other financing alternatives, whether directly or through any of our joint ventures. Instead, we offer certain incentives to our homebuyers if they go through preferred mortgage lenders. Using preferred mortgage lenders affords us greater control and transparency, as well as possible options that may not otherwise be made available by other mortgage lenders.
 
The following is a summary of our preferred lending relationships by region:
 
Northern California: We offer qualified homebuyers up to $2,500 towards closing costs if they use the preferred mortgage lender, Wells Fargo.
 
Southern California: We offer qualified homebuyers $5,000 to $10,000 towards closing costs if they use the preferred mortgage lender, Loan Depot, and the preferred title providers, First American and Fidelity (depending on community). Of this amount, the preferred mortgage lender contributes $2,500 and we contribute the balance.
 
Arizona: We offer qualified homebuyers $5,000 towards closing costs if they use the preferred mortgage lenders, NFM Inc. and VIP Mortgage (depending on community), and the preferred title providers, First American and DHI Title (depending on community). Of this amount, the preferred mortgage lender contributes $3,000 and we contribute the balance.
 
Metro New York: We do not have a preferred mortgage lender and do not offer closing cost incentives to our homebuyers.
  8

 
Substantially all homebuyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers.
 
Quality Control and Customer Service
 
We strive to provide a high level of customer service throughout the entire sales process and after a home has closed escrow. The participation of the sales representatives, on-site construction supervisors and the post-closing customer service personnel, working in a team effort, is intended to foster our reputation for quality and service and ultimately lead to an overall better customer home-buying experience that will benefit not only the customer directly, but also benefit us in improving buyer retention and future homeowner referrals.
Warranty Program
 
We provide our homebuyers with a limited warranty, covering workmanship and materials. The scope and duration of the limited warranty varies based on the location of the project. This limited warranty covers construction defects, as defined in the limited warranty agreement provided to each home buyer, for the length of its legal liability for such defects (which may be up to ten years in some circumstances), as determined by the law of the state in which we build. The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with us and requires that homebuyers agree to the definitions and procedures set forth in the warranty, including the submission of unresolved construction-related disputes to binding arbitration.
 
In connection with the limited warranty covering construction defects, we maintain general liability insurance coverage. We believe that our insurance policies will respond to construction defect claims on homes that close during each policy period for the duration of our legal liability, upon satisfaction of the applicable self-insured retention. In California, each of our insurance policies provides a single wrap-up policy of insurance to us and our subcontractors. As a result, we are not required to obtain proof of insurance from our subcontractors nor be named as an additional insured under their individual insurance policies regarding the subcontractors general liability policies for work on our projects. The subcontractors still must provide proof of insurance regarding general liability coverage for off-site work, workers compensation and auto coverage. Furthermore, we generally require that each subcontractor and design professional agreement provide us with an indemnity, subject to various limitations. In Arizona, we maintain excess liability insurance covering products and completed operations and obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to damages resulting from faulty workmanship and materials. In addition, we maintain warranty and other reserves for homes based on our historical market experience and judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes built.
 
There can be no assurance, however, that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be enforceable against the homebuyers, that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that we will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building-related claims or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors and design professionals or that such subcontractors and design professionals will be viable entities at the time of the claim. Although we actively monitor our insurance reserves and coverage, because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractors indemnities and warranty arrangements, and our reserves will collectively be adequate to address all warranty and construction defect claims in the future. In addition, contractual indemnities with subcontractors may be difficult to enforce. We may also be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of products and completed operations excess liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly. This coverage may be further restricted or become more costly in the future.
 
Raw Materials
 
Typically, the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started or other market conditions could cause delays in the delivery of, shortages in, or higher prices for necessary materials. Delivery delays or the inability to obtain necessary materials could result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We have established national and regional purchase programs for certain materials and will continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve competitive pricing.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, nondisclosure, license agreements and/or other contractual provisions and technical measures with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. We also use the Landsea trademark pursuant to an exclusive license and its terms as granted under the License Agreement described below. While all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular trademark, license, franchise, or concession to be material to our overall business.
 
Sale of Lots and Land
 
In the ordinary course of business, we continually evaluate land sales and have sold and expect that we will continue to sell land as market and business conditions warrant. We may also sell both multiple lots to other builders (bulk sales) and improved individual lots for the construction of custom homes where the presence of such homes adds to the quality of the community. In addition, in the future we may acquire sites with commercial, industrial and multi-family parcels which will generally be sold to third-party developers.
 
Information Systems and Controls
 
We assign a high priority to the development and maintenance of our budget and cost control systems and procedures. Through our fully integrated accounting, financial and operational management information system, management regularly evaluates the status of our projects in relation to budgets to determine the cause of any variances and, where appropriate, adjusts our operations to capitalize on favorable variances or to limit adverse financial impacts.
Regulation
 
We and our competitors are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulation which imposes restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can ultimately be built within the boundaries of a particular project. We and our competitors may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or slow-growth or no-growth initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate. Because we usually purchase entitled land, we believe that the moratoriums would adversely affect us only if they arose from unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. However, these are normally locked-in when we receive entitlements.
 
We and our competitors are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the sites environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, cause us and our competitors to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Environmental laws and regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. Our projects in California and New York are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. California, for example, includes a ten-year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims and imposes notification obligations respecting environmental conditions, sometimes recorded on deeds, and also those required to be delivered to persons accessing property or to home buyers or renters, which may cause some persons, or their financing sources, to view the subject parcels as less valuable or as impaired. However, environmental laws have not, to date, had a material adverse impact on our operations.

Competition
 
The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and fragmented. While our competitors vary by market, we compete directly with major national builders such as KB Home, Lennar Corp., Tri Pointe Homes, Inc., PulteGroup, Inc. and D.R. Horton, Inc. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including home design and location, construction quality, customer service and satisfaction and reputation. We believe that we compete effectively in our existing markets as a result of our product differentiation through environmentally focused technology homebuilding, home automation, geographic diversity and substantial development expertise. Further, we believe that we are adept at acquiring and integrating existing homebuilders based on our recent acquisition history, allowing us to grow both organically and via acquisition.
Seasonality
 
Our operations are historically seasonal, with the highest new order activity typically occurring in the spring and summer, although this is impacted by the timing of project openings and competition in surrounding projects, among other factors. In addition, a majority of our home deliveries typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of each fiscal year, based on the construction cycle times of our homes. As a result, our revenues, cash flow and profitability are higher in that same period. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
We believe that we maintain strong relations with our employees. Some employees of the subcontractors we utilize are unionized, but none of our employees are unionized.
 
Number of Employees. As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes employed 253 employees, including corporate staff, supervisory personnel of construction projects, warranty service personnel for completed projects, as well as persons engaged in administrative, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, sales and marketing activities. 252 of these employees were full-time employees.
 
Retention and Turnover. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2020, with a 12-month lookback period, Landsea Homes had a voluntary turnover rate of approximately 14.6%. In total, during this period, Landsea Homes had an involuntary turnover rate of approximately 18.2%, which was largely attributable to corporate restructuring to reduce overhead in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, representing approximately 12.6% of its workforce. During this period, approximately 5.1% of involuntary turnover was the result of operational restructuring of overlapping functions as a result of Landsea Homes recent acquisition of Garrett Walker.
 
Internal Promotion and Compensation. Every year, each manager helps set his or her employees professional goals for internal promotion, and monitors employees progress throughout the year. Employee compensation is determined based on industry benchmarks and cost of living factors. Bonus incentives are primarily paid out annually based on division performance goals. We recommend and promote continuing education for all employees, and offers tuition reimbursement for job-related curriculum.
 
Employee Productivity. Senior management works with department level leads to appropriately tailor and establish annual, quarterly, and monthly goals, depending on position. These metrics are actively monitored via the use of third-party service providers and internal workflow programs. In addition, division level leads regularly meet with staff on a weekly basis to discuss workplace metrics. We also utilize a number of third-party services providers to track employee metrics.
 
11

 
 Worker Safety and Compliance with Laws. We actively train our employees and management on workplace safety and related laws and regulations. With respect to workplace safety, we utilize a third-party vendor to ensurecompliance with California/Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and federal OSHA safety requirements. Internally, we have a formal safety committee that meets quarterly to review employee safety protocols. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted office and field safety guidelines, supplied personal protective equipment to all staff and implemented work from home protocols as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With respect to compliance with employment related laws and regulations, we continuously provide management training on leadership development, the progressive discipline process, and updates on labor laws, protected leaves and wage and hour rules. In addition, each of our employees is required to complete a two-hour harassment prevention training.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following June 22, 2023, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock and public warrants that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
We also qualify as a smaller reporting company (smaller reporting company), as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
