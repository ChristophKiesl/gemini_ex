ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
TG Venture Acquisition Corp. (the “Company” or “TG Venture”) is a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the technology industries in the United States and other developed countries, with a special focus within the space technology, financial technology, technology, media and telecom (“TMT”) industries and related sectors. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
Corporate Information
 
TG Venture was incorporated in Delaware in 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 1390 Market Street, Suite 200 San Francisco, CA 94102. Our corporate website is https://tgventureacquisition.com/
 
IPO
 
On November 5, 2021, TG Venture consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 11,500,000 units (the “Units”), which included 1,500,000 Units upon a full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000.
 
On November 5, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,500,000 Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Tsangs Group Holdings Limited (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,500,000. Each of the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.
 
A total of $117,300,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
We initially filed a registration statement for the IPO on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on August 13, 2021, as amended, and it was declared effective on November 2, 2021 (File No. 333-258773) (the “IPO Registration Statement”); the “IPO Prospectus” filed in connection with our IPO pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) was filed with the SEC on November 3, 2021.

Business Combination Agreement
 
On December 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) by and among (i) The Flexi Group Limited, a business company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (the “Flexi”), (ii) The Flexi Group Holdings, Ltd., a business company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Flexi (“PubCo” and, together with Flexi, the “Flexi Group”), (iii) The Flexi Merger Co. Ltd., a business company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub 1”), and (iv) Flexi Merger Co. LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub 2” and, Merger Sub 2, PubCo and Merger Sub 1, each, individually, an “Acquisition Entity”).
 
Capitalized terms used in this section, but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Business Combination Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into Flexi (the “Initial Merger”), whereby the separate existence of Merger Sub 1 will cease and Flexi will be the surviving entity of the Initial Merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, and (ii) following confirmation of the effective filing of the documents required to implement the Initial Merger, Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into TGVC (the “SPAC Merger” and together with the Initial Merger, the “Mergers”), the separate existence of Merger Sub 2 will cease and the Company will be the surviving entity of the SPAC Merger and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo.
 
As a result of the Mergers, among other things, (i) each outstanding Flexi Ordinary Share will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive such number of PubCo Ordinary Shares that is equal to the Company Exchange Ratio, (ii) each outstanding SPAC Unit will be automatically detached and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one share of SPAC Class A Common Stock and one SPAC Warrant, (iii) each outstanding share of SPAC Class B Common Stock will automatically convert into SPAC Class A Common Stock, (iv) each outstanding share of SPAC Class A Common Stock will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive such number of PubCo Ordinary Shares that is equal to the SPAC Exchange Ratio, and (v) each outstanding SPAC Warrant will be assumed by PubCo and converted into a warrant to purchase PubCo Ordinary Shares (each, an “Assumed SPAC Warrant”).
 
Earnout
 
The Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, provides that Flexi shareholders as of the Initial Merger will have the right to receive up to an aggregate of 2,900,000 additional PubCo Ordinary Shares based on the total annual revenues of PubCo in each of the two fiscal years following the Closing Date.
 
On August 10, 2023, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Business Combination Agreement. The First Amendment revises the earnout periods set forth in the Business Combination Agreement to provide that Flexi shareholders may receive earnout shares based on PubCo revenue targets achieved during the first two full fiscal years following the closing of the business combination to be effected pursuant thereto.
 
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
 
The Business Combination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties, which will not survive the Closing. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect (with respect to Flexi) or SPAC Material Adverse Effect (with respect to the Company). “Material Adverse Effect” as used in the Business Combination Agreement means with respect to Flexi or the Company, as applicable, any event, state of facts, development, change, circumstance, occurrence or effect that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets and liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the applicable party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of such party or any of its subsidiaries to consummate the Transactions, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Business Combination Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the Business Combination Agreement.

The Business Combination Agreement also contains pre-closing covenants of the parties, including obligations of the parties to operate their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and to refrain from taking certain specified actions without the prior written consent of the other applicable parties, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. Additionally, the parties have agreed not to solicit, negotiate or enter into competing transactions, as further provided in the Business Combination Agreement. The covenants do not survive the Closing (other than those that are to be performed after the Closing).
 
As promptly as practicable after the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and PubCo have agreed to prepare and file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form F-4 (as amended, the “F-4 Registration Statement”) in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of the offer and issuance of the PubCo Ordinary Shares and Assumed SPAC Warrants to be issued pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement The F-4 Registration Statement will contain a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of (i) the Company soliciting proxies from its shareholders to approve the Business Combination Agreement, the Transactions and related matters (the “the Company Shareholder Approval”) at a special meeting of the Company shareholders (the “Shareholder Meeting”), (ii) providing the Company’s shareholders an opportunity, in accordance with its organizational documents and initial public offering prospectus, to redeem their shares of SPAC Class A Common Stock (collectively, the “Redemptions”), and (iii) PubCo’s offering and issuance of the PubCo Ordinary Shares and Assumed Warrants in connection with the Transactions.
 
PubCo agreed to take all action within its power so that effective at the Closing, the board of directors of PubCo will consist of no less than five individuals, two of whom may be designated by the Sponsor, and a majority of whom shall be independent directors in accordance with Nasdaq requirements, and which shall comply with all diversity requirements under applicable Law.
 
In addition, prior to Closing, PubCo agreed to amend and restate its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association (the “PubCo Governing Documents”). The PubCo Governing Documents will include customary provisions for a memorandum of association and articles of association of a British Virgin Islands publicly traded company that is traded on Nasdaq.
 
Conditions to the Parties’ Obligations to Consummate the Mergers
 
Under the Business Combination Agreement, the parties’ obligations to consummate the Transactions are subject to a number of customary conditions for special purpose acquisition companies, including, among others, the following: (i) the approval of the Mergers and the other shareholder proposals required to approve the Transactions by the Company’s and Flexi’s shareholders, (ii) all specified approvals or consents (including governmental and regulatory approvals) have been obtained and all waiting, notice, or review periods have expired or been terminated, as applicable, (iii) the effectiveness of the F-4 Registration Statement, (iv) PubCo’s initial listing application with Nasdaq shall have been conditionally approved and, immediately following the Closing, PubCo shall satisfy any applicable initial and continuing listing requirements of Nasdaq and PubCo shall not have received any notice of non-compliance therewith, and (v) the PubCo Ordinary Shares and Assumed SPAC Warrants having been approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to round lot holder requirements.
 
In addition to these customary closing conditions, the Company must also hold net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to Closing, net of Redemptions and liabilities (including the Company’s transaction expenses).
 
The obligations of the Company to consummate the Transactions are also subject to, among other things (i) the representations and warranties of Flexi and of each Acquisition Entity being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement, (ii) material compliance by Flexi and each Acquisition Entity with its pre-closing covenants, and (iii) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect.
 
In addition, the obligations of Flexi to consummate the Transactions are also subject to, among other things (i) the representations and warranties of the Company being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement, (ii) material compliance by the Company with its pre-closing covenants, and (iii) the absence of a SPAC Material Adverse Effect.

Termination Rights
 
The Business Combination Agreement contains certain termination rights, including, among others, the following: (i) upon the mutual written consent of the Company and Flexi, (ii) if the consummation of the Transactions is prohibited by governmental order, (iii) if the Closing has not occurred on or before May 5, 2023, (iv) in connection with a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement by Flexi or the Company which is not capable of being cured or is not cured within 30 days after receipt of notice of such breach, (v) by either the Company or Flexi if the board of directors of the other party publicly changes its recommendation with respect to the Business Combination Agreement and Transactions and related shareholder approvals under certain circumstances detailed in the Business Combination Agreement, (vi) by either the Company or Flexi if the Shareholder Meeting is held and the Company Shareholder Approval is not received, (vii) by the Company if the requisite Company Audited Financial Statements and PCAOB-compliant unaudited financials of Flexi for the first, second and third quarters of 2022 (to the extent required in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement) have not been delivered by January 4, 2023, with respect to the first and second quarters, and January 16, 2023, with respect to the third quarter, or (viii) by the Company if Flexi does not receive the written consent of its shareholders to the Business Combination Agreement and related approvals within five business days after the F-4 Registration Statement has become effective.
 
None of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement are required to pay a termination fee or reimburse any other party for its expenses as a result of a termination of the Business Combination Agreement. However, each party will remain liable for willful and material breaches of the Business Combination Agreement prior to termination.
 
Trust Account Waiver
 
Flexi and each Acquisition Entity agreed that it and its affiliates will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Company’s trust account held for its public shareholders, and agreed not to, and waived any right to, make any claim against the trust account (including any distributions therefrom).
 
The Business Combination Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the foregoing description thereof is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement provides investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about the parties. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Business Combination Agreement were made as of the execution date of the Business Combination Agreement only and are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by the parties to each other in connection with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies, and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement as characterizations of the actual statements of fact about the parties.
 
Shareholder Support Agreement
 
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo, Flexi and certain Flexi shareholders entered into a Shareholder Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain Flexi shareholders agreed (i) to vote their Flexi shares in favor of the Business Combination Agreement (including by execution of a written consent), the Mergers and the other Transactions, (ii) to waive any rights to seek appraisal or rights of dissent in connection with the Business Combination Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (iii) to consent to the termination of all shareholder agreements with Flexi (with certain exceptions), effective at Closing, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Shareholder Support Agreement. Flexi shareholders party to the Shareholder Support Agreement collectively have a sufficient number of votes to approve the Business Combination Agreement, the Mergers and the other Transactions.

The Shareholder Support Agreement and all of its provisions will terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earlier of the Closing and termination of the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to its terms. Upon such termination of the Shareholder Support Agreement, all obligations of the parties under the Shareholder Support Agreement will terminate; provided, however, that such termination will not relieve any party thereto from liability arising in respect of any breach of the Shareholder Support Agreement prior to such termination.
 
Sponsor Support Agreement
 
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement with the Sponsor, PubCo, Flexi, and certain members of the Company’s board of directors and management team (the “Holders”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and the Holders agreed to vote their the Company shares in favor of the Business Combination Agreement (including by execution of a written consent), the Mergers and the other Transactions, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Support Agreement.
 
The Sponsor Support Agreement and all of its provisions will terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earlier to occur of Closing and termination of the Business Combination Agreement pursuant to its terms.
 
Lock-Up Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and PubCo entered into separate Lock-Up Agreements (each a “Lock-Up Agreement”) with Sponsor, certain members of the Company’s board of directors and management team, and certain Flexi shareholders, pursuant to which 95% of the PubCo Ordinary Shares to be received by such shareholders will be locked-up and subject to transfer restrictions for a period of time following the Closing, as described below, subject to certain exceptions. That portion of the securities held by such shareholders will be locked-up until the earliest of: (i) the six month anniversary of the date of the Closing, (ii) subsequent to the Business Combination, if the last sale price of PubCo Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the date of the Business Combination, and (iii) the date after the Closing on which PubCo completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of PubCo’s shareholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in PubCo for cash, securities or other property.
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Sponsor and certain Flexi shareholders pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo agreed to provide Sponsor and such shareholders with certain rights relating to the registration for resale under the Securities Act of the PubCo Ordinary Shares and Assumed Warrants that they received in the Mergers.
 
Forms of the foregoing agreements related to the Business Combination Transaction are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report, and the foregoing description thereof is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the respective agreement.
 
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. After closing, The Flexi Group’s ordinary shares are expected to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under ticker symbol FLXG.
 
Nasdaq Listing
 
On June 22, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company’s Class A common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days and its number of publicly held shares, the Company no longer meets Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(C), which requires listed companies to maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares (“MVPHS”) of at least $15 million.
 
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D) provides a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 19, 2023 (the “First Compliance Date”), in which to regain compliance with this requirement. If the Company’s market value of publicly held shares is $15 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-day compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written notice of compliance to the Company. If the Company fails to regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing standards, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s class A common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel.

On August 11, 2023, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company is no longer in compliance with the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) of $50,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) (the “MVLS Requirement”). The Notice has no effect at this time on the listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq. 
 
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days, or until February 7, 2024 (the “Second Compliance Date,” together with the First Compliance Date, the “Compliance Dates”), to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. To regain compliance, the Company’s MVLS must close at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to the Compliance Date. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement prior to the Compliance Date, Nasdaq will notify the Company that its securities are subject to delisting, at which point the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. 
 
 The notifications have no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s Class A common stock on Nasdaq Global Market. The Company intends to actively monitor its MVPHS and MVLS between now and the respective Compliance Dates, and may, if appropriate, evaluate available options including applying for a transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the requirements. While the Company is exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its securities on Nasdaq Global, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with Nasdaq Global listing standards or satisfy the requirements necessary to transfer the listing of its securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market.
 
PRC Limitations and Concerns
 
Our company is a Delaware corporation with no subsidiaries in mainland China. We do not maintain operations in mainland China, do not generate revenues from mainland China, and do not provide services or conduct sales or marketing activities in mainland China or to residents in mainland China. We have committed not to undertake our initial business combination with any entity that is based in, located in or has its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and have conducted a target search outside of China. We will not conduct an initial business combination with any target company that conducts operations through variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are a series of contractual arrangements used to provide the economic benefits of foreign investment in Chinese-based companies where Chinese law prohibits direct foreign investment in the operating companies. As of the date of this filing, we have not been contacted by any Chinese authorities in connection with our operations or the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 
The Sponsor is not incorporated in mainland China and none of its subsidiaries are incorporated in mainland China. It does not maintain operations in mainland China, does not generate revenues from mainland China, and does not provide services or conduct sales or marketing activities in mainland China or to residents in mainland China. As of the date of this filing, the Sponsor has not been contacted by any Chinese authorities in connection with the operation of TGVC’s business or consummation of the Business Combination. However, we have significant ties to China, because Mr. Tsang, our Chief Executive Officer, who is also the sole member and sole director of the Sponsor, is located in Hong Kong and because the Sponsor is a Hong Kong company.
 
As of the date of this filing, we have not been contacted by any Chinese authorities in connection with our operations or consummation of the Business Combination. Our PRC legal counsel, Han Kun Law Offices, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other PRC governmental agency to operate our business or to consummate the Business Combination. TGVC’s Hong Kong legal counsel, DLA Piper Hong Kong, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from any Hong Kong governmental agency to operate TGVC’s business or to consummate the Business Combination.

Given the risks and uncertainties of doing business in China discussed elsewhere in this report, the location and ties of the Sponsor to China may make us a less attractive partner to a target company not based in China, which may thus increase the likelihood that we will not consummate a business combination. Our ties to the PRC may make us less likely to consummate a business combination with any target company outside of the PRC, which may result in non-PRC target businesses having increased leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination within a certain timeframe, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. If we fail to complete an initial business combination in the prescribed timeframe, we will cease all our operations and would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public shareholders may receive only $10.83 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, based on the amount available in our trust account on a per share basis, and our warrants will expire worthless.  See “Risk Factors — We may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.” on page 30.


We do not believe that, as of the date of this filing, there are legal or operational risks to us associated with the laws and regulations of mainland China solely due to or as a result of the Sponsor being based in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC and enjoys its own limited autonomy as defined by the Basic Law, which is a national law of the PRC and the constitutional document for Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s legal system, which is different from that of the PRC, is based on common law and has its own laws and regulations. Though some of the national laws of the PRC are made applicable in Hong Kong under the Basic Law, as of the date hereof, such laws are not applicable to us.
 
Pursuant to the Basic Law, national laws of the PRC shall not be applied in Hong Kong, except for those relating to defense, foreign affairs and other matters outside the autonomy of Hong Kong, which may be listed in Annex III of the Basic Law and applied locally by promulgation or local legislation. While the National People’s Congress of the PRC has the power to amend the Basic Law, the Basic Law expressly provides that no amendment to the Basic Law shall contravene the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong. As a result, national laws of the PRC not listed in Annex III of the Basic Law (and any regulatory notices issued pursuant to those national laws) do not apply in Hong Kong.
 
Except as set forth above, the laws in the PRC are expected to apply to mainland Chinese businesses, rather than businesses in Hong Kong which operate under a different set of laws from mainland China. As a result, we do not believe that, as of the date hereof, there are legal or operational risks associated with the laws and regulations of mainland China affecting us solely due to or as a result of the Sponsor being based in Hong Kong. However, as the Sponsor is based in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, there is no guarantee that certain existing or future laws of the PRC will not become applicable to a company such as us.
 
Given the PRC government’s significant oversight over the conduct of business operations in mainland China and in Hong Kong, and in light of (a) China’s recent extension of authority not only in mainland China but into Hong Kong and (b) the fact that rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice, there are risks and uncertainties that we and the Sponsor cannot foresee at this time. For example, (i) the government of Hong Kong may (x) enact similar laws and regulations to those in mainland China, which may seek to exert control over business combinations conducted by Hong Kong-based entities or sponsors or (y) implement laws on such business activities to be more aligned with mainland China, and (ii) certain PRC laws and regulations may become applicable in Hong Kong in the future. To the extent that any PRC laws and regulations become applicable to us or the Sponsor, we or the Sponsor may be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the evolving laws and regulations of the PRC, their interpretation and implementation, and the legal and regulatory system in the PRC more generally, including with respect to the enforcement of laws and the possibility of changes of rules and regulations with little or no notice. If certain PRC laws and regulations, including existing laws and regulations and those enacted or promulgated in the future, were to become applicable to companies such as us or the Sponsor in the future, the application of such laws and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, our ability to consummate the Business Combination and our ability to offer securities to investors, any of which may, in turn, cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.

Relevant organizations of the PRC government have made recent statements or recently taken regulatory actions related to data security, anti-monopoly, and overseas listings of PRC-based businesses. For example, in addition to the PRC Data Security Law and the Measures for Cybersecurity Review issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) that became effective on February 15, 2022 (the “Cybersecurity Review Measures”), relevant PRC government agencies have recently taken anti-trust enforcement action against certain PRC-based businesses. Our management understands that such enforcement action was taken pursuant to the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law that applies to monopolistic activities in domestic economic activities in mainland China and monopolistic activities outside mainland China that eliminate or restrict market competition in mainland China. In addition, in July 2021, the PRC government provided new guidance on PRC-based companies raising capital outside of the PRC, including through arrangements called VIEs. In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed enhanced disclosure requirements on PRC-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. To date, the Cybersecurity Review Measures have not impacted our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investment or list our securities on the Nasdaq because neither we nor the Sponsor are PRC-based businesses and because neither we nor the Sponsor engage in the types of activities regulated by the Cybersecurity Review Measures. However, if the PRC government were to expand the scope of the Cybersecurity Review Measures to regulate non- PRC-based companies, such regulation could impact our ability to conduct our business and accept foreign investment.
 
Additionally, on February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) published the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies and several supporting guidelines (collectively, the “Overseas Listing Filing Rules”), which became effective on March 31, 2023 and regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC-based companies by adopting a filing-based regulatory regime. According to the Overseas Listing Filing Rules, if the issuer meets both of the following criteria ( “Criteria for CSRC Filing”), the overseas securities offering and listing conducted by such issuer shall be deemed as an indirect overseas offering and listing: (i) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the main parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China. As of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor meet the Criteria for CSRC Filing above.
 
Although we do not believe that, as of the date hereof, there are legal or operational risks associated with the laws and regulations of the PRC solely due to or as a result of the Sponsor being based in Hong Kong, changes in the policies, regulations, rules and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may be made quickly with little or no advance notice. Recent statements by the PRC government have indicated an intent of the PRC government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in PRC-based issuers. The PRC government may intervene or influence the operations of PRC-based issuers at any time, and may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in PRC-based issuers.
 
If the PRC government determines that we or the Sponsor is a PRC-based issuer, if the PRC government takes any other actions to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas, if the PRC rules and regulations become applicable in Hong Kong, or if the PRC government’s statements and regulatory actions otherwise apply to us or the Sponsor, the PRC government would be able to intervene in and influence our or the Sponsor’s operations at any time and such governmental or regulatory interference could result in a material change in TGVC’s operations and its ability to consummate the Business Combination and/or the value of our securities. To date, the Cybersecurity Review Measures have not impacted our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investment or list its securities on the Nasdaq because neither we nor the Sponsor are mainland PRC-based businesses and because neither we nor the Sponsor engage in the types of activities regulated by the Cybersecurity Review Measures. However, if the PRC government were to expand the scope of the Cybersecurity Review Measures to regulate non-mainland PRC-based companies, such regulation could impact our ability to conduct our business and accept foreign investment.

Further our Sponsor currently owns approximately 39.95% of our issued and outstanding shares. As a result, we may be considered a “foreign person” under rules promulgated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) and may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as CFIUS, or ultimately prohibited. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited. See “Risk Factors — We may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company if such initial business combination is subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), or ultimately prohibited.” on page 31.
 
Although we are a Delaware corporation, the Sponsor is a Hong Kong company and certain of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and most of their assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for our stockholders to effect service of process upon the Sponsor, us or our managements inside China, or to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Acquiring or Operating Businesses in the PRC” under the subheading “Our Stockholders may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process in the U.S. and enforcing civil liabilities in mainland China or Hong Kong against us, the Sponsor and certain of their directors and officers.” on page 32.
 
Our PRC legal counsel, Han Kun Law Offices, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither we nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other PRC governmental agency to operate TGVC’s business and to consummate our initial business combination. This conclusion is based on the fact that: (i)we are a Delaware corporation without subsidiaries, operations and revenues in mainland China, and have committed not to undertake our initial business combination with any entity that is based in, located in or has its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and it has conducted a target search outside of China, (ii) the Sponsor is a Hong Kong company without subsidiaries, operations and revenues in mainland China, (iii) Flexi   is a British Virgin Islands company without subsidiaries, operations and revenues in mainland China, and only some of Flexi’s business operations are conducted in Hong Kong through its Hong Kong subsidiary, and (iv) pursuant to the Basic Law, national laws of the PRC shall not be applied in Hong Kong except for those listed in Annex III of the Basic Law (which is confined to laws relating to defense and foreign affairs, as well as other matters outside the autonomy of Hong Kong). However, since the PRC governmental agencies have certain discretion in administration, interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations of the PRC, and in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC governmental agencies, such as those related to the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by PRC-based companies, we and the Sponsor may become subject to the risks of the uncertainty of any future regulatory actions of the PRC governmental agencies. In addition, Flexi and PubCo may also become subject to the laws and regulations of the PRC to the extent that it commences business and customer facing operations in mainland China as a result of any future partnership, acquisition, expansion, or organic growth. Furthermore, our Hong Kong legal counsel, DLA Piper Hong Kong, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from any Hong Kong governmental agency to operate our business or to consummate the Business Combination.

Neither we nor the Sponsor have relied, and do not expect to rely, on dividends or other distributions on equity from any of our subsidiaries for our cash requirements. Although we have no plans to declare cash dividends, if we determine to pay cash dividends to the our stockholders in the future, it may depend on receipt of funds from one or more subsidiaries.
 If, in the future, (i) we were to have any PRC-based subsidiaries or (ii) we were to be considered by the PRC government to be a PRC-based subsidiary of the Sponsor, such subsidiaries, or us, as applicable, would be subject to certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends under PRC laws and regulations. In particular, any PRC subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated after-tax profits after making up losses as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, any PRC subsidiaries would be required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Such reserve funds would not be permitted to be distributed to TGVC as dividends. At its discretion, any PRC subsidiaries would be permitted to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to a discretionary common reserve.
 Any future PRC subsidiaries would likely generate a portion of their revenue in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of any such PRC subsidiaries to use their Renminbi revenues to pay dividends to us. In addition, the PRC Enterprise Tax Law (“EIT Law”) and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC-resident enterprises are incorporated.
 Furthermore, if certain procedural requirements are satisfied, the payment of current account items, as defined in the relevant PRC laws and regulations, including profit distributions and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) or its local branches. However, where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of mainland China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies, approval from or registration with competent government authorities or their authorized banks is required. The PRC government may take measures at its discretion from time to time to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account or capital account transactions. To the extent we desire to use funds from any future PRC subsidiaries to fund our operations, the foreign exchange control system could prevent us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, and we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to any offshore intermediate holding companies or ultimate parent company, or to our shareholders or investors. Further, we cannot assure you that new regulations or policies will not be promulgated in the future, which may further restrict the remittance of Renminbi into or out of the PRC. We cannot assure you, in light of the restrictions in place, or any amendment to be made from time to time, that our future PRC subsidiaries, if any, will be able to satisfy their respective payment obligations that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the remittance of dividends outside of the PRC.

For a detailed description of risks associated with the cash transfer through the post combination organization, see “Transfers of Cash to and from our Post Business Combination Subsidiaries” on page 33 and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Acquiring or Operating Businesses in the PRC” under the subheadings “Cash-Flow Structure of a Post-Acquisition Company Based in China” on page 33 and “Exchange controls that exist in the PRC may limit our ability to utilize our cash flow effectively following our initial business combination” on page 34. To date, we have not pursued an initial business combination with a PRC-based entity and there have not been any capital contribution or shareholder loans by us to any PRC entities, we do not yet have any subsidiaries, and we have not received, declared or made any dividends or distributions.
 
Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCA Act”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in (1) mainland China of the PRC because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations.
 
In December 2020, Congress enacted the HFCA Act, and the SEC released interim final amendments that begin to address the components of this Act. In November 2021, the SEC approved PCAOB Rule 6100, which establishes a process for determining which registered public accounting firms the board is unable to inspect or investigate completely. In December 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize its rules under the HFCA Act that set forth submission and disclosure requirements for commission-identified issuers identified under the Act, specify the processes by which the SEC will identify and notify Commission-Identified Issuers, and implement trading prohibitions after three consecutive years of identification.
 
In December 2022, Congress passed the omnibus spending bill and the President signed it into law. This spending bill included the enactment of provisions to accelerate the timeline for implementation of trading prohibitions from three years to two years. Separately, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB published its determination that in 2022, the PCAOB was able to inspect and investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. This determination reset the now two-year clock for compliance with the trading prohibitions for identified issuers audited by these firms. The amendment had originally been passed by the U.S. Senate in June 2021, as the “Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.”
 
Our auditor, Marcum LLP, is a United States accounting firm and is subject to regular inspection by the PCAOB. Marcum LLP is headquartered in New York, NY, not mainland China or Hong Kong and was not identified as a firm subject to the PCAOB’s Determination Report announced on December 16, 2021. As a result, we do not believe that HFCA Act and related regulations will affect us. Nevertheless, trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCA Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and that as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. Moreover, on August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China – the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely, consistent with U.S. law. The Statement of Protocol is intended to grant to the PCAOB complete access to the audit work papers, audit personnel, and other information it needs to inspect and investigate any firm it chooses, with no loopholes and no exceptions.

PROPOSED BUSINESS
 
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on February 8, 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the IPO. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
 
The Company plans to take a differentiated approach compared to the recent plethora of special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) issuances by focusing its initial business combination search on the following industry segments:
 

● | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) 
● | Edge Computing 
● | Quantum Computing 
● | Virtual Reality (“VR”) 
● | Augmented Reality 
● | Blockchain 
● | Space Exploration 
● | Internet of Things 
● | 5G Data and Telecommunications 
● | Cybersecurity 
● | AI Powered Drug Discovery 
● | Hydrogen Energy 
● | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure 
● | Financial Technology 
● | Technology, media and telecom TMT 

 
We will not be limited to any particular industry, sector or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a business combination target, except that we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). However, we believe that we have created a significant competitive advantage compared to other SPACs that have chosen to pursue potential business combinations with a much wider targeted mandate. With nearly 420 active SPACs as of June 11, 2021 still searching for a business combination, target companies have never had more choices nor do they necessarily know which SPACs to approach. By assembling a management team and board of directors with highly successful operating and investing track records in the industries we seek to pursue, we believe that we will be the preferred SPAC partner for the highest quality assets within our focus areas. In addition, our management team and board of directors have vast experience both investing in and leading various organizations, both public and private, and domestic and international government agencies. This experience base affords us the opportunity to leverage our robust network of contacts to execute our focused strategy across the globe.

--


We also intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses with enterprise values less than $1.25 billion. We believe that this segment of the market is underserved and has greater valuation arbitrage opportunities and more favorable competitive dynamics compared to many SPACs that are targeting assets with enterprise values greater than $2 billion. In 2020, the average SPAC initial public offering raised gross proceeds of $336 million. Raising less capital in our IPO will enable us to offer target companies at our preferred valuation range a more compelling transaction structure versus larger SPACs that may be seeking a similar asset. In addition, we can maintain a higher degree of agility and flexibility should we choose to pursue a business with an enterprise value greater than $1.25 billion by leveraging our public stock as additional currency for the merger consideration.
 
We believe we have the right team, strategy and market opportunity to identify, acquire and manage a “best-in-class” business with the ultimate mandate of delivering an attractive return to all stakeholders.
 
Our co-Founders, Pui Lan Patrick Tsang (Chairman and CEO) and Philip Rettger (CFO and Director), are industry pioneers, visionary investors, serial entrepreneurs and deeply experienced operators with an extensive deal-making history. Over the course of their careers, Mr. Tsang and Mr. Rettger have founded, controlled, assembled and financed enterprises across various segments and industries, including cable, broadcast, cellular, fiber, satellite, communications technologies, wireless broadband, energy and technology invention and project development. As pioneering investors, they have brought value and profits to stockholders of numerous businesses through rollups, acquisitions, mergers, both independently and in partnerships with other public corporations, and private equity firms.
 
Mr. Tsang and Mr. Rettger have shown repeated foresight in identifying and investing in key trends that have shaped the global space technology, financial technology and TMT markets. In bringing vision into reality, they have consistently built cohesive executive teams and culture-led organizations to execute within competitive markets.
 
Mr. Tsang currently serves as Chairman of Tsangs Group, a fourth-generation Single-Family Office. Tsangs Group has made concentrated investments in companies, businesses and assets across multiple sectors, and currently has operations in over 50 countries spanning 6 continents. In most circumstances, Tsangs Group prefers to make investments in a project of early stage in a particular sector and subsequently seek to make complementary investments in that sector to achieve improved economies of scale, market penetration and operating efficiencies.
 
The co-Founders have proven their extensive deal-making abilities throughout their careers and created significant stockholder value across numerous high-profile transactions including:
 
Tsangs Group became the early-stage investor and strategic advisor to Pulse Evolution Group in 2018, which subsequently acquired the German listed Nexway Group, and the combined group rebranded as FaceBank Group in 2018. On April 2020, FaceBank Group completed the merger with fuboTV, the largest vMVPD streaming platform in the US with primary focus on channels that distribute live sports including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and international soccer. fuboTV became successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2020 (FUBO:US). When comparing with the valuation at the time when Tsangs Group came in, the share price of fuboTV reached $62 at the end of December 2020; Tsangs Group achieved an approximately 300 times return in 2 years on this investment.
 
Under the leadership of Patrick Tsang (Chairman of our sponsor), the Original IPO Opportunities SP1 (formerly known as OX Global Fund SPC-OX Global Fund IPO Opportunities SP1), managed by Original Asset Management Limited (wholly owned by Patrick Tsang and a SFC regulated company) has been actively involved in the sourcing and investment in the highly sought-after IPO investment opportunities in Asia, Japan, Korea and the US. The performance of the Fund in 2020 was quite promising with a return of 42.89% for the year then ended.
 
Patrick Tsang founded Vale International Group Limited, which changed its name to Fragrant Prosperity Holdings Limited. It was established to undergo acquisitions of businesses in the financial and technology sectors in Europe and Asia. It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since September 2016. Patrick came in as GBP0.0233 per share and the share price was GBP0.07 on April 10, 2021, achieving a return of 200%.
 
Tsangs Group was an investor of Live Company Group (“LVCG”), a leading Live Events and Entertainment company. LVCG was founded in 2017 and is trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. LVCG acquired BRICKLIVE Group and the Parallel Live Group. BRICKLIVE holds events that have received widespread acclaim of partner-driven shows designed to showcase the benefits of LEGO-brand toys as an educational tool worldwide. During the very short period of 9 months, Tsangs Group achieved a total return of 33%.

No Permission Required from the Chinese Authorities (including Hong Kong Authorities) for the Business Combination

We are a Delaware corporation with no subsidiaries in the PRC. We do not maintain operations in the PRC, do not generate revenues from the PRC, and do not provide services or conduct sales or marketing activities in the PRC or to residents in the PRC. None of our officers and directors are located in the PRC. We have committed not to undertake our initial business combination with any entity that is based in, located in or has its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and we have conducted a target search outside of China. As of the date of this filing, we have not been contacted by any Chinese authorities in connection with our operations or consummation of the Business Combination. Our PRC legal counsel, Han Kun Law Offices, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other PRC governmental agency to operate our business or to consummate the Business Combination. Our Hong Kong legal counsel, DLA Piper Hong Kong, has advised that, as of the date of this filing, neither TGVC nor the Sponsor is required to obtain permissions or approvals from any Hong Kong governmental agency to operate our business or to consummate the Business Combination. 
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, our focus will be on the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries in the United States and other developed countries (excluding mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau). There are a number of emerging technology sub-sections where we believe superior acquisition opportunities may be identified and secured through management’s network and connections. These include, but are not limited to:

● | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning. Technologies that enable computers to autonomously learn, deduce and act, through utilization of large data sets. These technologies enable development of systems that collect and store massive amounts of data, and analyze that content to make decisions based on probability and statistical analysis. Applications for Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning include speech recognition, computer vision, robotic control and accelerating processes in the empirical sciences where large data sets are essential.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”). Automated or remote-controlled mechanical devices and technology. This includes machinery programmed to perform repetitive tasks such as manufacturing and loading; precision tasks such as surgery or semiconductor production; and remote-operated movement or travel, such as that provided by unmanned aerial vehicles, subsea vehicles and land vehicles. 
● | Edge Computing. Distributed IT architecture which moves computing resources from clouds and data centers as close as possible to the originating source. Edge computing reduces latency requirements while processing data and saving network costs. The edge can be the router, ISP, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, etc. Near-term applications include smart homes and the cloud gaming industry. 
● | Quantum Computing. The exploitation of collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. Real-world use includes artificial intelligence, cryptography, financial modelling, molecular modelling, particle physics and weather forecasting. 
● | Virtual Reality (“VR”). Hardware and software technologies providing an immersive, three-dimensional user experience in a virtual world. VR environments are provided through a computer screen augmented with wearable devices, such as head-mounted stereo-optical displays or sensor-embedded gloves. VR also includes remote communication environments, where users interact with each other through computer-generated avatars. 


● | Augmented Reality. Technology which overlays superimposed computer-generated images over a view of the real-world, thus altering and/or enhancing the current perception of reality. Companies in this space are involved with hardware and software development, content creation, and distribution related to AR products. This includes headsets, eye tracking technology, smart glasses, video games, mobile applications, training programs, advertising, and commercial and retail applications that utilize AR technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Blockchain. The blockchain refers to a digital ledger that provides a secure way of making and recording transactions, agreements and contracts. Blockchains are unique in that their ledger is distributed across a network of computers such that it cannot be controlled by a single entity and has no single point of failure. This space includes companies involved in developing blockchain applications related to smart contracts, crowd funding, supply chain auditing, cryptocurrency, identity management, intellectual property, and file storage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Space Exploration. The provision of services, scientific research, or technology related to spaceflight, satellites, or space exploration. This includes micro-satellites, nano-satellites, ground station networks, rocket technology, payload systems, spacecraft development, satellite imagery, satellite telecommunications, space-based data, space materials, space tourism, and asteroid mining. 
● | Internet of Things. Products that are enabled with sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects and/or software that uses this sensor data to improve the user experience or allows for sharing this data with a network of other devices, often using the same Internet Protocol that connects the Internet. 
● | 5G Data and Telecommunications. In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will increasingly be used as general internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine areas. 4G cellphones are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G enabled wireless devices.
● | Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access. Common types of cybersecurity include network security, data loss prevention, cloud security, intrusion detection/prevention systems, identity and access management and antivirus/anti-malware solutions. 
● | AI Powered Drug Discovery. AI and other innovative technologies that use data from multiple sources can enable more precise, targeted treatments that will help shift the health ecosystem toward a future where medicine is personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory. While these solutions focus mostly on transforming the process of small-molecule research, they are also showing potential in the identification of new biologics such as therapeutic antibodies against cancer, fibrosis, and other diseases. 


● | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure. The number of charging outlets has expanded as awareness and adoption of electric vehicles has increased, and this trend is expected to continue and accelerate as large automakers continue to make investments into electric vehicle development. Includes companies building EV charging infrastructure to support the electrification of the mobility sector. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hydrogen Energy. Hydrogen is potentially promising as an energy storage and delivery system, due to its zero emissions output (other than water) and high energy density per weight unit. Companies in this space are developing methods, machines, and materials to use hydrogen for multiple purposes. Key technologies represented here include the design and manufacture of hydrogen fuel cells, new methods of hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, hydrogen fuel infrastructure, and hydrogen-powered mobility solutions. 
● | Financial Technology. FinTech is disruptive to our life every day. The power dynamics in the payments industry are changing as consumers shift from cash and checks to digital payment methods and the COVID-19 Pandemic accelerated digitization. The payments industry demonstrated its adaptability, springing quickly to serve as a crisis response co-partner for individuals and businesses, assist in distributing government stimulus payments, and help customers, merchants, and corporate clients transact in contactless ways. Favorable trends such as the shift to contactless payments, the growing adoption of digital wallets, and the more widespread use of B2B payments automation are lifting the industry’s prospects.
● | Technology, media and telecom. The TMT, sector is an industry grouping that includes the majority of companies focused on new technologies. The TMT sector is sometimes also referred to as technology, media, and communications (“TMC”).

Business Strategy
 
We believe the future success of the capital markets for space technology, financial technology and TMT, companies is dependent on new company formation, the sustainability of robust private market funding and an increased willingness of private technology companies to become publicly-traded and therefore become available to a broader universe of investors who can benefit from their disruption and growth. Our mission is to create an alternative path to a traditional IPO for disruptive and agile technology companies to achieve their long-term objectives and overcome key deterrents to becoming public. By leveraging our extensive operational experience and network, we believe we can provide a number of benefits to potential targets and public market investors that can potentially lead to attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns in the public markets. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
Our strategy revolves around seeking targets in the following sectors:
 

● | Technologies including but not limited to:
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) 
● | Edge Computing 
● | Quantum Computing 
● | Virtual Reality (“VR”) 
● | Augmented Reality 
● | Blockchain 
● | Space Exploration 
● | Internet of Things 
● | 5G Data and Telecommunications 
● | Cybersecurity 
● | AI Powered Drug Discovery 
● | Hydrogen Energy 
● | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure 


● | Financial Technology
--+---------------------


● | Technology, media and telecom, or TMT
--+--------------------------------------

 
We also intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses with enterprise values of less than $1.25 billion and may be located in the United States and other developed countries. We believe this segment of the market has greater sourcing inefficiencies, as companies of this scale and geographic “footprint” tend to be overlooked. Our core competencies and international rolodex will allow us to identify opportunities earlier, move faster, and catalyze more accretive value creation strategies compared to our competition. In addition to potential business combinations, we may identify on our own, we also anticipate that our focused mandate and pedigreed team will generate inbound leads from various sources outside of our network, including investment market participants, private equity and venture capital groups, investment banking firms, consultants, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 

21

Our management team possesses the following characteristics necessary to execute on our business strategy:
 

● | Extensive leadership experience: Our management team and board of directors have held leadership positions at and invested in some of the world’s most cutting edge and forward-thinking public and private companies in our core focus areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Access to proprietary deal flow: As both lead investors and operators with deep relationships across the globe, we have access to specific opportunities before they become more widely available to others. 
● | Deep-pocketed network: Our network includes asset managers who collectively manage billions of dollars, allowing us to support fully the strategies we wish to implement and provide target companies with deal certainty. 
● | Focus on aligning interests: We have a deep commitment to providing win-win scenarios for all stakeholders and intend to focus on generating attractive outcomes for our investors as well as the target company’s stockholders, employees and customers.
● | Extensive investing and M&A experience: Our team has completed numerous investments and transactions with companies through their lifecycle, including seed and growth equity rounds, IPOs and integrating acquisitions. 
● | Track record of value creation: We have a long history of generating substantial risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders across public and private markets and through many business cycles over the last several decades. 

 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in the space technology, financial technology, and TMT industries in the United Stated and other developed countries, we intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive operational experience and that presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile under our stewardship.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We intend to leverage what we believe is a competitive advantage in sourcing potential targets that will materially benefit from our unique expertise and where we are best situated to augment the value of the business following the completion of the initial business combination.
 
We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities across the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries, but we will not undertake our initial business combination with an entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Our selection process will leverage our relationships with leading company founders, executives of private and public companies, venture capitalists and growth equity funds, in addition to the extensive industry and geographical reach of TG Venture’s platforms, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination targets. Given our profile and thematic approach, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources.
 
We also believe that our founders’ reputation, experience and track record of making investments especially in the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets.

We also anticipate offering the following benefits to our business combination partner:
 

● | Partnership with our management team and board of directors who have extensive and proven experiences in leading, operating and investing in world-class companies in our focus areas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Access to our vast network of contacts and relationships across the globe to accelerate growth initiatives; 
● | Access to deep-pocketed, fundamental investors who can provide confidence with respect to deal closure and long-term support of implementing management’s strategy; 
● | A listed public currency for future acquisitions and quick access to the capital markets to support organic growth opportunities; 
● | Ability for the existing management team to retain control and accelerate their long-term vision. 

 
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines to evaluate prospective target businesses. We may, however, decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:
 

● | can be leaders or pioneers in space technology, financial technology and TMT; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | are technology first companies with strong portfolios of intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how; 
● | can benefit from the extensive networks and insights we have built. 
● | can use technology to drive meaningful operational improvements and efficiency gains; 
● | are ready to operate in the scrutiny of public markets, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place; 
● | will likely be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets; 
● | are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, innovation to develop new products or services, improvement of financial performance or growth through a business combination; 
● | have significant embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities; 
● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the market, based on our company-specific analysis and due diligence review; for a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends; and
● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. 

 
We may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our stockholder communications related to the acquisition. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, this would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
NASDAQ rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We expect to be able to comply with NASDAQ rules and by reason of our arrangements with ThinkEquity, there are no deferred underwriting commissions. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to NASDAQ rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We will also seek to utilize the expertise of our management team in the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Certain of our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity, including Mr. Patrick Tsang, our CEO, who is also an independent director of Model, another blank check company. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
In addition, members of our team may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 1390 Market Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, California 94102, and our telephone number is (628) 251-1369. Our executive offices are provided to us by our sponsor. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.
