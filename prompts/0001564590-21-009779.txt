 Our Industry
 Outsourcing engineering and manufacturing services enable OEMs to concentrate on their core strengths, such as research and development, branding, and marketing and sales. In an outsourcing model, OEMs also benefit from improved efficiencies and reduced production costs, volume purchasing leverage, reduced fixed capital investments, improved inventory management, and access to global engineering and manufacturing resources. OEMs continue to turn to outsourcing partners to reduce time-to-market and time-to-volume production through utilization of their service providers’ product design and engineering services, technology solutions and manufacturing services.
 Outsourcing rates fluctuate periodically, and not all industries we serve are outsourcing at the same growth rates. The traditional markets of computing and telecommunications have used the outsourcing model for a number of years and have a lower outsourcing growth potential than the less-outsourced medical, complex industrials, A&D, and semi-cap markets, which we identify as our higher-value markets. The higher-value markets typically provide the opportunity for increased value-add which leads to higher profitability than the traditional markets and in some cases provide the potential for stable growth. The higher-value markets also align well with our expertise in more complex and highly regulated products, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on increased outsourcing in these markets.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be the solutions provider of choice to leading OEMs that we believe offer the greatest potential for profitable growth. To meet this goal, we have implemented the following strategies:

• | Focus on More Complex Products for Customers. EMS providers serve a wide range of OEMs in different industries, offering scalable electronics assembly as a service. The product scope ranges from easy-to-assemble, low-cost, high-volume products targeted for the consumer market to complicated, state-of-the-art, mission-critical products. Higher-volume manufacturing customers in the more traditional markets of computing and telecommunications often compete on price with short product life cycles and require less value-add from EMS providers. We focus on lower-volume manufacturing customers in the A&D, medical, and industrial markets, which are often in highly regulated industries where they are increasingly outsourcing higher value-added services to their EMS providers to meet stringent regulatory and time-to-market requirements. In the traditional markets, we focus on customers with more complex requirements

such as high-performance computing and next generation telecommunications. In the higher-value markets where outsourcing growth rates are increasing and product life cycles are longer, we focus on customers where there is a strong match between our capabilities and their needs. Our objective is to achieve annual sales from higher-value market customers around 80% of total revenue which may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of revenue between sectors.

(1) Prior to the second quarter of 2019, results in the semi-cap sector were reported under test and instrumentation.
 
A substantial percentage of our sales are made to a small number of customers and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Sales to our ten largest customers represented 41%, 38% and 44% of our sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, sales to Applied Materials represented 12% of our sales. In 2019, no single customer represented 10% or more of our sales and in 2018, sales to International Business Machines Corporation represented 13% of our sales. 
 During the first quarter of 2019, we indicated we would not renew a legacy computing contract with a long-standing customer that represented $324 million and $285 million in revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  When this contract was last renewed in early 2016, it was assumed that the related product line would go end-of-life or decline substantially over time. The opposite happened and business performance on this contract deteriorated due to model mix and supply chain changes.  We notified the customer that we would not renew the contract past the expiration date at the end of 2019.  We coordinated a transition plan with the customer and fully exited the contract in the third quarter of 2019. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—The loss of a major customer would adversely affect us” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report and “2020 Overview” in Part II, Item 7 of this Report.
 Seasonality
 Seasonality in our business has historically been driven by customer complexion and product mix, particularly the industries that our customers serve. Although we have historically experienced higher sales during the fourth quarter, this pattern does not repeat itself every year. In addition, we typically experience our lowest sales volume in the first quarter of each year.
Suppliers
 We maintain a network of suppliers of components and other materials used in our operations. We procure components when a purchase order or forecast is received from a customer and occasionally utilize components or other materials for which a supplier is the single source of supply. If any of these single-source suppliers were unable to provide these materials, a shortage of components could temporarily interrupt our operations and lower

our profits until an alternate component could be identified and qualified for use. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Shortages or price increases of components specified by our customers would delay shipments and adversely affect our profitability” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Although we occasionally experience component shortages and longer lead times for various components, we have generally been able to reduce the impact of component shortages by working with customers to reschedule deliveries and with suppliers to provide the needed components using just-in-time inventory programs, or by purchasing components at slightly higher prices from distributors rather than directly from manufacturers. In addition, by developing long-term relationships with suppliers, we have been better able to minimize the effects of component shortages compared to manufacturers without such relationships. The goal of these procedures is to reduce our inventory risk.
 Competition
 The services we provide are available from many independent sources as well as from the in-house manufacturing capabilities of current and potential customers. Our competitors include Celestica Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Plexus Corp and Sanmina Corporation. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted markets are engineering solutions capabilities, product quality, flexibility, cost and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, reliability in meeting product delivery schedules, pricing, technological sophistication and geographic location.
 In addition, original design manufacturers (ODMs) that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in traditional markets, such as computing and telecommunication. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets.
 Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) & Sustainability
 Benchmark continues to evolve and improve upon its ESG strategy and is implementing and managing long-term, strategic sustainability initiatives.  The Nominating/Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is sponsoring this effort and in 2020, Benchmark established an ESG/Sustainability Council.  The ESG/Sustainability Council is currently chaired by Stephen J. Beaver, SVP, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, who is a member of our senior executive leadership team.  The Council also includes a cross-functional team of leaders representing operations, human resources, supply chain, regulatory compliance, finance, marketing communications, investor relations, facilities and the legal department.  The team has performed a materiality assessment aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) with the goal of developing future reporting that will likely include other frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For additional information, see “Human Capital Management” below.
 Benchmark’s long-term commitment to sustainability is comprehensive, placing increased focus and emphasis on environmental consciousness, social responsibility, ethics and corporate governance, and supply chain ecosystem responsibility. Our goal is to do our part in contributing to a more sustainable world, while providing value to our shareholders consistent with our business objectives. Our sustainability priorities include:
 Environmental Responsibility:
  
• | We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We engage our employees to accomplish this by conserving energy; reducing consumption of natural resources; preserving air, soil, and water quality, managing waste properly and encouraging reuse or recycling; reducing use of toxic substances and applying an ethical approach to source reduction and disposal efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All Benchmark manufacturing facilities are either currently certified or undergoing certification to ISO 14001, which is a set of standards related to environmental management and systems. The ISO 14001 standards help organizations minimize adverse impacts to the environment, comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, and achieve continual improvement in these areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benchmark has launched a number of global initiatives designed to reduce energy consumption in our facilities, including upgrades and or retrofits in LED and motion detector lighting, cooling towers, compressed air and vacuum systems, and exhaust fans.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Care for Our People:
  
• | We believe in upholding the principle of human rights, worker safety and observing fair labor practices within our organization and our supply chain.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We embrace diverse viewpoints and perspectives, recognizing that greater inclusion fosters innovation and achieves better decision making and financial results. Thus, we are strengthening our diversity, equity and inclusion programs with a planned set of actions around organizational training, refreshed company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of our employees, such as the implementation of 6S and visual management practices, developing, implementing and continuously improving our Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and providing appropriate education, reporting and controls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are committed to participating in the development of our surrounding communities and supporting diversity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the fall of 2019, a strategic customer presented a Benchmark operation with a “Supplier ESG Excellence Award” for their “participation, leadership and superiority during the Forced and Bonded Labor Prevention Program.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethics & Corporate Responsibility:
  
• | We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance, promoting business ethics and integrity, and embracing diversity and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are committed to observing fair, transparent and accountable operating practices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benchmark believes that its ultimate responsibility is to help create and foster the best possible work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we implemented a “Speak Up!” campaign designed to promote a positive and ethical organizational culture. We believe that each team member, regardless of position, shares in this responsibility, and we encourage all of them to “Speak Up!” with questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues, questions about company policies, suggestions about how we can make our organization better and to address any other concerns.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | To facilitate open and honest communication, in 2018 we upgraded our Helpline to include global local phone numbers together with language support that allows reporters to “Speak Up!” in over 150 native languages. In addition, we added a web portal that allows online reporting of concerns, a place to ask questions, or quickly access ethics and compliance policies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe these efforts strengthen our enterprise ethics and compliance efforts and foster the environment where employees and stakeholders can express and have concerns resolved.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain Responsibility:
  
• | We are committed to sourcing with suppliers willing to support our sustainability initiatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benchmark endorses the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)(formerly the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition or EICC) Code of Conduct, which provides guidance in five critical areas of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance, including labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. Benchmark also seeks the same endorsement from our business partners, requesting that each business partner adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent at initial engagement and flowing these requirements through our commercial contracts to our business partners and supply chain. Benchmark also conducts a supply chain monitoring system to assess adherence in these areas with regard to our supply chain partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benchmark also endorses EcoVadis, a provider of sustainability ratings, intelligence and collaborative performance improvement tools for global supply chains. The EcoVadis methodology evaluates criteria across four themes: environment, fair labor practices, ethics/fair business practices and supply chains. In 2019, Benchmark was awarded the EcoVadis Silver Medal-Sustainability rating. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benchmark also supports Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act (Conflict Minerals Law) and efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Conflict Minerals Law and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, Benchmark adopted the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seeks to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from its suppliers, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. Benchmark does not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and is in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Benchmark therefore expects:
--+-----------------------------


- | our suppliers to source 3TG only from smelters and refiners validated as being conflict free and that do not directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in the DRC or other covered country;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | our suppliers to fully-comply with the Conflict Minerals Law and provide all necessary declarations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | our suppliers to pass these requirements through to their supply chain and determine the source and chain of custody of specified minerals, including 3TG; and any suppliers not willing to comply with these requirements shall be reviewed by global procurement with regard to future business and sourcing declarations. This conflict minerals policy encourages our suppliers to respect and protect human rights throughout the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Capital Management
 Our employees are an indispensable contributor to our success.  Only an inspired community of talented employees enable us to realize our Company Vision of “positively impacting lives by solving complex challenges with our customers, creating innovative products that no one imagined were possible.”
 We believe we have a responsibility to foster the best possible work environment for everyone in our organization through sound ethical and organizational governance, by promoting business ethics and integrity, and by embracing equality, diversity and inclusion throughout our organization and even extending to the board room. For additional information, see “Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) & Sustainability—Ethics & Corporate Responsibility,” in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.
 As mentioned, we established an ESG/Sustainability Council in 2020 with Board oversight to drive the five tenets of our long-term ESG strategy:  Environmental Responsibility, Our People, Our Community, Governance and COVID-19 Response.  Our commitment to ESG and these tenets is a strategic imperative as we build a sustainable infrastructure across the Company.  In partnership with our employees, we are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community through pollution prevention, conservation, responsible use and sustainable practices.  Through our sustainability initiatives, we further engage our employees to ensure that our business practices support diversity and inclusion to build an innovative workforce and to strive toward having our organization reflect the complexion of our customers and suppliers.  We are strengthening our diversity and inclusion programs with a planned set of actions around organizational training, refreshed company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy.  In our view, the goals of providing value to shareholders and upholding the principle of human rights and treating people fairly and with dignity are integrally interconnected.  To this end, we actively participate in the development of our surrounding community.  In June 2020, our CEO Jeffrey Benck broadly communicated our commitment to taking positive steps toward promoting equality and supporting racial justice.  In furtherance of this objective, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the One Benchmark Foundation made donations to advance the cause around racial inequality. 
 The safety of our employees is also of paramount concern to us.  We are committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of our employees, such as the implementation of 6S and visual management practices, developing, implementing and continuously improving our Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and providing appropriate education, reporting and controls.  We engage our employees to participate in decision-making as part of our Occupational Health and Safety Management System to ensure that we are developing, implementing and continuously improving our health and safety ecosystem and performance to prevent injury and illness.  From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a COVID-19 Task Force, a cross-functional advisory team of Company leaders committed to promoting the health and safety of our employees in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and ensuring that our employees’ safety remains a constant focal point.  The COVID-19 Task Force has promulgated policies, procedures, protocols and guidelines relating to symptom awareness and contact tracing, remote work requirements, effective hygiene practices, travel restrictions, temperature screening and visitor protocols, social distancing, facial mask requirements, enhanced cleaning protocols and decontamination procedures.
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 11,234 people, approximately 376 of whom were engaged in design and development engineering. None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by works councils. Some European countries also often have mandatory legal provisions regarding terms of employment, severance compensation and other conditions of employment that are more restrictive than U.S. laws. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we believe that our employee and labor relations are strong.

Segments and International Operations
 We have manufacturing facilities in the Americas, Asia and Europe to serve our customers. Benchmark is operated and managed geographically, and management evaluates performance and allocates resources on a geographic basis. We currently operate outside the United States in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Romania, Singapore and Thailand. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, 52%, 47% and 45%, respectively, of our sales were from our international operations. See Note 9 and Note 14 to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for segment and geographical information.
Governmental Regulation
 Our operations, and the operations of businesses that we acquire, are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to security clearance, trade compliance, anticorruption, environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable requirements. Significant costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements, which could affect our earnings and competitive position. In addition, our past, current and future operations, and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns. 
 We periodically generate and temporarily handle limited amounts of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law. We contract for the off-site disposal of these materials and have implemented a waste management program to address related regulatory issues. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Compliance or the failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause us significant expense” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.
