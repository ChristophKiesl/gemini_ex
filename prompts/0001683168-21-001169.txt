Overview
 
Genius Brands International, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a global content and brand management company that creates and licenses multimedia content. Led by experienced industry personnel, we distribute our content in all formats as well as a broad range of consumer products based on our characters. In the children's media sector, our portfolio features “content with a purpose” for toddlers to tweens, which provides enrichment as well as entertainment. New intellectual property titles include the preschool property Rainbow Rangers, which debuted in November 2018 on Nickelodeon and which was renewed for a second season and preschool property Llama Llama, which debuted on Netflix in January 2018
 and was renewed by Netflix for a second season. Our library titles include the award-winning Baby Genius, adventure comedy Thomas Edison's Secret Lab® and Warren Buffett’s Secret Millionaires Club, created with and starring iconic investor Warren Buffett, which is distributed across our Genius Brands Network on Comcast’s Xfinity on Demand, AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Cox, Dish, Sling and Zumo, as well as Connected TV. We are also developing an all-new animated series, Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten with Stan Lee’s Pow! Entertainment, Oak Productions. Arnold Schwarzenegger lends his voice as the lead and is also an Executive Producer on the series. The show will be broadcast in the United States on Amazon Prime and the Company’s wholly owned distribution outlet, Kartoon Channel!. In July 2020, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with POW, Inc. (“POW!”) in which we agreed to form an entity with POW! to exploit certain rights in intellectual property created by Stan Lee, as well as the name and likeness of Stan Lee. The entity is called “Stan Lee Universe, LLC”. POW! and the Company are finalizing the details of the venture. This agreement will enable us to assume the worldwide rights, in perpetuity, to the name, physical likeness, physical signature, live-action and animated motion picture, television, online, digital, publishing, comic book, merchandising and licensing rights to Stan Lee and over 100 original Stan Lee creations, from which Genius Brands plans to develop and license approximately multiple properties each year.
 
In addition, we act as licensing agent for Penguin Young Readers, a division of Penguin Random House LLC which owns or controls the underlying rights to Llama Llama, leveraging our existing licensing infrastructure to expand this brand into new product categories, new retailers, and new territories.
 
Our Products
 
Original Content
 
We own and produce original content that is meant to entertain and enrich toddlers to tweens as well as families. It is generally a three-year cycle from the inception of an idea, through production of the content and development and distribution of a range of consumer products to retail, creating an inevitable lag time between the creation of the intellectual property to the realization of economic benefit of those assets. Our goal is to maintain a robust and diverse portfolio of brands, appealing to various interests and ages, featuring evergreen topics with global appeal. Our portfolio of intellectual property can be licensed, re-licensed, and potentially exploited for years to come, with revenue derived from multiple sources and territories. Our portfolio of original content includes:

Distribution
 
Content
 
Today’s global marketplace and the manner in which content is consumed has evolved to a point where we believe there is only one viable strategy, ubiquity. Kids today expect to be able to watch what they want whenever they want and wherever they want. As such, content creators now must offer direct access on multiple fronts. This includes not only linear broadcast in key territories around the world but also across a multitude of digital platforms. We have strong relationships to and actively solicit placement for our content via major linear broadcasters, as well as on the digital side with Netflix, Comcast’s Xfinity platform, AppleTV, Roku, Samsung TV, Amazon Fire, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, Cox, Dish, Sling and Zumo and Connected TV. We replicate this model of ubiquity around the world defining content distribution strategies by market that blends the best of linear, VOD, and digital distribution.
 
Finally, we expanded our long-term strategic partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment from domestic to global in January 2017. On August 31, 2018, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment assigned all of its rights and interest in our programs to Alliance Entertainment, LLC (“AEC”).
 
Consumer Products
 
A source of our revenue is our licensing and merchandising activities from our underlying intellectual property content. We work directly in licensing properties to a variety of manufacturers and occasionally to retailers. We currently have across all brands in excess of 50 licensees and hundreds of licensed products either in development, in market or scheduled to enter the market. Products bearing our marks can be found in a wide variety of retail distribution outlets reaching consumers in retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Barnes & Noble, Kohl’s, Amazon.com and many more. License agreements that we enter into often include financial guarantees and commitments from the manufacturers guaranteeing a minimum stream of revenue for us. As licensed merchandise is sold at retail, these advances and/or minimum guarantees can earn out at which point we could earn additional revenue.

Marketing
 
Our marketing mission is to generate awareness and consumer interest in our brands via a 360-degree approach to reach our audience through all touchpoints. Successful marketing campaigns for our brands have not only included traditional marketing tactics but now include utilizing influencers (individuals with a strong, existing social media presence who drive awareness of our brands to their followers), strategic social media marketing, and cross-promotional consumer product campaigns. We also deploy digital and print advertising to support the brands, as well as work with external media relations professionals to promote our efforts to both consumer and industry. We consistently initiate grass roots marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships with brands that align and offer value to us. Our Kartoon Channel! platform, which reaches over 100 million U.S. television households, provides reach for cross promotion of content and consumer products.
Competition
 
We compete against other creators of children’s content including Disney, Nickelodeon, PBS Kids, and Sesame Street, as well as other small and large creators. In the saturated children’s media space, we compete with these other creators for both content distribution across linear, VOD, and digital platforms, as well as retail shelf space for our licensed products. To compete effectively, we are focused on our strategic positioning of “content with a purpose,” which we believe is a point of differentiation embraced by the industry, as well as parents and educators. Additionally, the Kartoon Channel! enables us to increase the awareness of our brands through an owned platform.
Customers and Licensees
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for 44% of our revenue from the delivery of Rainbow Rangers Season 2 to Nick Jr. and MTV Networks Latin America. For the year ended December 31, 2019 two customers accounted for 65% of our revenue from the delivery of Llama Llama Season 2 to Netflix and the delivery of Rainbow Rangers Season 1 to Nick Jr. As of December 31, 2020, we had partnered with over 50 consumer products licensees. As of the same date, we licensed our content to over 50 broadcasters in over 145 countries globally as well as a number of VOD and online platforms that have a global reach. This broad cross-section of customers includes companies such as Comcast, Netflix, Sony, YouTube, Mattel, Target, Penguin Publishing, Manhattan Toys, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon, Google, Bertelsmann Music Group, Discovery International, and others both domestically and internationally.
Government Regulation
 
The FCC requires broadcast networks to air a required number of hours of Educational and Informational content (E/I). We are subject to online distribution regulations, namely the FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which regulates the collection of information of children younger than 13 years old.
 
We are currently subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally, including numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, enforcement and advertising of credit accounts, and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Although credit to some of our customers is provided by third parties without recourse to us based upon a customer’s failure to pay, any restrictive change in the regulation of credit, including the imposition of, or changes in, interest rate ceilings, could adversely affect the cost or availability of credit to our customers and, consequently, our results of operations or financial condition.
 
Licensed toy products are subject to regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act and regulations issued thereunder. These laws authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) to protect the public from products which present a substantial risk of injury. The CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products. The CPSC may also impose fines or penalties on manufacturers or retailers. Similar laws exist in some states and other countries in which we plan to market our products. Although we do not manufacture and may not directly distribute toy products, a recall of any of the products may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We also maintain websites which include our corporate website located at www.gnusbrands.com, as well as www.spacepopgirls.com, www.kidgeniustv.com, www.babygenius.com, www.smckids.com, www.slam7.com, www.edisonsecretlab.com and www.rainbowrangers.com. These websites are subject to laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications and commerce, which is a currently developing area of the law. The United States has enacted Internet laws related to children’s privacy, copyrights and taxation. However, laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled. The growth of the market for Internet commerce may result in more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that place additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. We cannot predict with certainty what impact such laws will have on our business in the future.  In order to comply with new or existing laws regulating Internet commerce, we may need to modify the manner in which we conduct our website business, which may result in additional expense.
 
Because our products are manufactured by third parties and licensees, we are not significantly impacted by federal, state and local environmental laws and do not have significant costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations.
 
Human Capital
 
Our continued success depends on management implementing effective human resource initiatives in order to recruit, develop and retain key employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had 27 full-time equivalent employees and one contracted part-time employee. We employ on an outsourced, as-needed basis, contractors in the fields of investor relations, public relations, accounting, legal, and production. We strive to foster an innovative and team-oriented culture and view our human capital resources and initiatives as an ongoing priority. Further in 2020, we appointed one of our employees as our first “Director of Diversity.” That individual works to both insure that diverse candidates are considered for open positions and works to make sure our content offerings represent characters of diverse backgrounds and are free from bias.

As of December 31, 2020, we own the following properties and related trademarks: “SpacePop”, Secret Millionaires Club, Thomas Edison’s Secret Lab, “Baby Genius”, “Kid Genius”, “Wee Worship”, and “Kaflooey”, as well as several other names and trademarks on characters that had been developed for our content and brands.
