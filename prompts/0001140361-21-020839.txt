Introduction
 
Roth CH Acquisition I Co. (the “Company” or “ROCH”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 13, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
On May 7, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 7,500,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), and three-quarters of one warrant (“Warrant” or “Public Warrants”) entitling the holder of each whole Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $75,000,000.
 
On March 7, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with initial shareholders of the Company of 262,500 units (the “Private Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,625,000.The Private Units are identical to the Units sold as part of the public Units in the IPO except that the Warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.
 
Subsequently, on May 22, 2020, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) on May 26, 2020. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 150,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $1,500,000. On May 26, 2020, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 3,000 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $30,000. On May 26, 2020, the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option, the Company has canceled an aggregate of 243,750 shares of Common Stock issued to certain stockholder of the Company prior to the IPO and Private Placement.
 
A total of $76,500,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the initial public offering (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placements on May 7, 2020 and May 26, 2020, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by November 7, 2021 and (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (iv) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of the Company’s public shares to seek redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination by November 7, 2021 or (v) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On November 16, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Roth CH Acquisition I Co. Parent Corp. (“ParentCo”), Roth CH Merger Sub LLC (“Merger Sub LLC”), Roth CH Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub Corp.”) and PureCycle Technologies LLC, pursuant to which we will acquire PCT for consideration of a combination of shares in ParentCo and assumption of indebtedness. A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and you should read it carefully to understand the rights and obligations of the Company contained therein.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub Corp will merge with and into the Company (the “RH Merger”), with the Company surviving the RH Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ParentCo (the “ROCH Surviving Company”); (ii) simultaneously with the RH Merger, Merger Sub LLC will merge with and into PCT (the “PCT Merger”), with PCT surviving the PCT Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ParentCo (the “PCT Surviving Company”); and (iii) following the PCT Merger, ParentCo will contribute to the PCT Surviving Company the proceeds of the PIPE Placement (as defined in the Merger Agreement). ROCH Surviving Company will acquire, and ParentCo will contribute to ROCH Surviving Company (the “ParentCo Contribution”) all units of the PCT Surviving Company directly held by ParentCo after the PCT Merger, such that, following the ParentCo Contribution, the PCT Surviving Company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ROCH Surviving Company (together with the RH Merger, the PCT Merger and the other transactions related thereto, the “Business Combination”).
 
The aggregate consideration payable to the PCT securityholders for the Proposed Transactions (the “PCT Merger Consideration“) consists of ParentCo Common Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) issued on the closing date (the “Share Consideration”), up to 4,000,000 additional ParentCo Common Shares upon the achievement of certain targets (the “Earnout Shares“) and the assumption of all indebtedness related to (a) the Limited Offering Memorandum, dated September 23, 2020 (in connection with the bond offering by Southern Ohio Port Authority to PureCycle: Ohio LLC) and (b) the convertible senior notes and certain other indebtedness used to fund the construction of an industrial process facility in Ironton, Ohio (collectively, the “Construction Indebtedness”) of PCT as of the closing date (the “Assumed Indebtedness”).
 
The Company has called a special meeting of stockholders to be held on March 16, 2021 to approve the Business Combination and related matters. If approved, the Business Combination is expected to be consummated in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions and other deliverables and provisions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
