TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.
 
Business Overview
 
Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp., together with its subsidiaries (collectively “we,” “our,” “us,” “Tonix” or the “Company”), is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative pharmaceutical products to address public health challenges. Our most advanced drug development program is focused on delivering an efficacious and safe long-term treatment for PTSD. PTSD is characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates. We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD and other central nervous system disorders. In September 2016, we discontinued our fibromyalgia program in order to fully focus our resources on our PTSD program.
 
Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment for PTSD. Our development pipeline includes: TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate), a separate pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) candidate designed for daytime administration for the treatment of PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with steroid use; TNX-801, a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, or HPXV; TNX-301 an IND candidate for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, or AUD; and TNX-701, a biodefense development program for protection from radiation injury. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
 
TNX-102 SL – Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Program
 
TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, for sublingual administration and transmucosal absorption. TNX-102 SL has a proprietary, Protectic™ protective eutectic formulation of cyclobenzaprine that allows for rapid systemic exposure and increased bioavailability through the transmucosal delivery. We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD under an IND cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in June 2014.

An estimated 8.6 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by hyperarousal, avoidance, emotional numbing, and sleep disturbances. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD. Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use. Antianxiety drugs, also called anxiolytics, are not approved for PTSD, but are commonly prescribed despite the recommendations against their use by many experts. Anxiolytics are comprised of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs, which carry risks of tolerance and addiction and are also associated with potential serious side-effects, such as retrograde amnesia.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The principal components of our strategy are to:
 

• | Develop TNX-102 SL for PTSD. We currently are focusing on the development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD. Our broader development strategy is to leverage the patentable formulation to explore the clinical potential of TNX-102 SL in multiple other central nervous system disorders that are underserved by currently available medications and represent large unmet medical needs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL. We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL for PTSD, either on our own or through collaboration with partners. We believe TNX-102 SL can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage. An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas. If we determine that such a strategy would be more favorable than developing our own sales capabilities, we would seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of TNX-102 SL; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates. We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution. In the case of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties. We recently received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, for patent claims the will protect the pharmaceutical eutectic composition of TNX-102 SL until 2034. We plan to opportunistically apply for new patents to protect TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates. We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors. In the case of TNX-102 SL, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy. We plan to continue these activities in tandem with our clinical development of TNX-102 SL and to conduct similar work in relation to our other product candidates as they advance in their development; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates. We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates. For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
 
PTSD is a chronic syndrome that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death. The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians. As of 2015, there were approximately 638,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA. Based on March 2015 VHA data, more than 19% of military veterans involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.
 
The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings. Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge. Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
 
TNX-102 SL
 
Overview
 
TNX-102 SL is a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation. We are developing TNX-102 SL for PTSD. We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization. Excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved for pharmaceutical use. Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
 
The current TNX-102 SL sublingual tablets contain 2.8 mg of CBP. For the treatment of PTSD, 5.6 mg of TNX-102 SL, comprised of two TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets administered simultaneously at bedtime, is in Phase 3 development. We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
 
TNX-102 SL is a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI. In PTSD, both paroxetine and sertraline are believed to exert their clinical benefit primarily by blocking serotonin reuptake. As such, TNX-102 SL acts upon cellular receptors that play important roles in the treatment of PTSD, including the transporters that mediate serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TNX-102 SL also acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for PTSD, including the serotonin 2A, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H-1 receptors.
 
CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL® (oral immediate-release tablet, 5 mg and 10 mg dosage forms) and AMRIX® (oral extended-release capsule, 15 mg and 30 mg dosage forms). The FLEXERIL brand of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablet has been discontinued since May 2013. There are numerous generic versions of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablets on the market. CBP-containing products are not indicated for the treatment of PTSD. CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Immediate-release, or IR, CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment. Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day immediate-release CBP tablets.
 
We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term dosing regimen. We believe the selected dose of TNX-102 SL and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in PTSD. Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral immediate-release CBP tablets. In clinical studies, TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg were generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies. Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration.
 
We expect that any applications we submit to the FDA for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product. In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States. Currently, we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 3 development. We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to provide clinical benefit to this and possibly other CNS indications that are underserved by currently marketed products.

On March 10, 2017, we received a notice of allowance for the US patent application No. 14/214,433 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride”, which includes compositions of cyclobenzaprine HCl and methods of manufacturing the eutectic. The allowed claims will protect the pharmaceutical composition, since it is based on the eutectic. The allowed claims will also protect the method of manufacturing the eutectic. Eutectic tablets containing cyclobenzaprine HCl and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability. A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal’s lattice. The distance between the molecular units is not changed. A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2034 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
 
TNX-102 SL – PTSD Program
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD under an effective IND application.
 
Clinical Development Plan
 
Phase 2 AtEase Study
 
In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 study of TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related PTSD, which we refer to as the AtEase study. We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016. In the AtEase study, patients were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks. This study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 patients in the modified intent-to-treat population. The primary objective of the AtEase study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using TNX-102 SL to treat military-related PTSD at a dose of 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo. The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
 
AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD. Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by Mixed-effect Model Repeated Measures, or MMRM, with Multiple Imputation, or MI, analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of patients of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms. TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.
 
In the AtEase study, TNX-102 SL was well tolerated and the patient retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and 84% on TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg. Four distinct serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess) in the TNX-102 SL arm, which was determined to be unrelated to TNX-102 SL. The most common non-dose related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the patients receiving placebo. Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the patients receiving placebo. Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of patients receiving placebo. Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the patients receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the patients receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the patients receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the patients receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the patients receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo. For the patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.

Open-label Extension Study for AtEase 
 
Patients who completed the AtEase study were eligible to enroll into a three-month open-label extension study with TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg. We conducted this open-label extension study to obtain additional safety information from patients in the AtEase Study. The clinical phase of this open-label extension study is complete. TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg was well tolerated for up to six months of treatment and no new safety signals were revealed in this open-label extension study.
 
Ongoing Phase 3 Study
 
We have commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in approximately 550 patients with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017. This first Phase 3 study, the “HONOR study,” is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study. The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study, except there will be one planned interim analysis and the involvement of an independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded interim analysis results. The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited patients or to stop for success. In addition, there will be one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 ≥ 33 in this Phase 3 study. The interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 50% (approximately 250 – 300 patients) of the initially planned patient enrollment is evaluable for efficacy. We received FDA acceptance of the Phase 3 HONOR study design in January of 2017. The HONOR study involves approximately 35 U.S. centers. As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
Prospective Phase 3 Study
 
A second, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in approximately 550 predominantly civilian PTSD patients will follow. We expect this study to be conducted at approximately 35 U.S. centers. As in the case of the HONOR and AtEase studies, the primary efficacy endpoint of this second Phase 3 study will be the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
 
Long-Term Safety Exposure Study for TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg
 
We plan to conduct the registration-required open-label extension studies of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg in patients who complete either the HONOR study or the predominantly civilian PTSD Phase 3 study. The goal of the open-label extension studies is to obtain adequate 6- and 12-month safety exposure data from the maximum therapeutic dose to support the registration of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD, a chronic psychiatric condition.
 
Regulatory Update
 
Subsequent to reporting the Phase 2 AtEase study topline result, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in early August 2016 to discuss the Phase 3 program required to support the registration of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for the treatment of PTSD and the remaining data package for the NDA filing. Based on this meeting discussion and the official FDA meeting minutes, we expect that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support the clinical approval of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for the treatment of PTSD. As described below, the first Phase 3 study will be in patients with military-related PTSD and the second Phase 3 study will study predominately civilian PTSD patients.
 
We held an End-of-Phase 2 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, meeting with the FDA in February 2016 to discuss the quality data requirement for an NDA submission for TNX-102 SL. In general, our proposed NDA CMC plan for TNX-102 SL was acceptable to the FDA and can be applied to the PTSD NDA.
 
In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD. The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was based on the preliminary clinical evidence of TNX 102-SL on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
 
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA within six months instead of 10 months and rolling submission of portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA's senior managers contributing significant guidance. The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our drug development program.

In March 2017, we held the Initial Cross-Disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the opportunity to accelerate the development and submission of the TNX-102 SL NDA for the treatment of PTSD. Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, a single-study NDA approval could be possible based on topline data from the ongoing HONOR study. Additionally, due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of TNX-102 SL, the FDA agreed that studies in assessing abuse potential of TNX-102 SL are not required to support the TNX-102 SL NDA.
 
Other NDA Requirements
 
An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, is required for the initial NDA submission. We submitted an Agreed iPSP in the first quarter of 2017, which incorporated the FDA comments received on our Initial Pediatric Study Plan submitted in the third quarter of 2016. A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
 
Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the NDA filing. Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for PTSD and the long-term safety data (up to 15 months) on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg in a prior fibromyalgia program, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product. Similarly, no drug abuse and dependence study is required for this NDA.
 
Phase 1 Bioequivalence, Bridging PK, Food-Effect and Dose-Proportionality Studies
 
Completed Bioequivalence Study
 
We completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence study that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-dose of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: (i) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets for the Phase 2 AtEase study; and (ii) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8.mg tablets for our clinical studies required to support the PTSD NDA submission and the to-be-marketed product. This bioequivalence study demonstrated that the TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at these two facilities were bioequivalent, supporting the use of the AtEase study to support the Phase 3 studies.
Planned Multi-dose Bridging PK Study
 
We intend to seek FDA marketing approval for TNX-102 SL pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA using AMRIX extended-release capsules (30 mg) as our reference listed drug, or RLD. As agreed upon by the FDA, we plan to study TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (two 2.8 mg tablets) in comparison to AMRIX 30 mg extended-release capsules in a multiple-dose bridging PK study to provide a systemic exposure bridge. If the exposures of TNX-102 SL (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) are less than the RLD maximum approved dose (30 mg) for the initial dose and at steady state, the results of this study will provide the necessary systemic exposure bridge of TNX-102 SL 5.6.mg to AMRIX 30 mg extended-release capsules and the approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD can rely on the safety findings (clinical and nonclinical) of the currently approved cyclobenzaprine drug products. 
Food Effect and Dose-proportionality Studies
 
To support the TNX-102 SL product registration, a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, food-effect, comparative bioavailability study of TNX-102 SL following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions and a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, dose-proportionality, comparative bioavailability study of TNX-102 SL following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions will be completed for the TNX-102 SL NDA submission.
TNX-102 SL Nonclinical Development
 
The FDA has accepted our proposed nonclinical data package to support our PTSD NDA filing. In October 2016, we completed the six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of TNX-102 in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S., if necessary. These chronic toxicity studies were requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the AMRIX approved prescribing information, or labeling, which is necessary to support the TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use. Based on the prescribing information of AMRIX and the post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for cyclobenzaprine. As a result, the FDA has advised that we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA submission for the treatment of PTSD.
Manufacturing
 
The TNX-102 SL drug product was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production. For the HONOR study, the predominantly civilian PTSD Phase 3 study and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA. The product’s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study.

Additional Product Candidates
 
We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601 for PTSD and TNX-801, a biologic vaccine product for the prevention of smallpox, as well as an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD.
 
TNX-601
 
TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the treatment for PTSD. Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but tianeptine sodium (amorphous) has been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for the treatment of depression since 1987. It is effective in various depressive states and also improves depression-associated anxiety and somatic complaints. We have discovered a novel oxalate salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine. Like cyclobenzaprine, tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties. Tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of stress and corticosteroid use. It is a weak mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, but does not have significant affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors. Due to its use in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for several decades, tianeptine has an established safety profile. In addition to being used to treat depression, several published studies support the potential of tianeptine as a potentially effective and safe therapy for patients with PTSD. Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed for daytime usage as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD. Tianeptine’s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than TNX-102 SL.
 
On April 19, 2016, we were issued US patent 9,314,469 B2 “Method for treating neurocognitive dysfunction,” which includes using tianeptine for cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use. We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use. Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
 
TNX-801
 
TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of HPXV grown in cell culture. TNX-801 was synthesized by Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us. HPXV has protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection. Vaccine manufacturing activities have been initiated to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801. We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile. Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
 
We intend to develop TNX-801 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, pursuant to which the FDA may grant marketing approval for a biological product for which safety has been established in humans and for which the requirements for efficacy are met based on adequate and well-controlled animal studies, where human studies are not ethical or feasible. This approval pathway has been described as the “Animal Rule”. In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security. We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine. In addition, 12 years of non-patent based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon FDA approval. We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND.
 
TNX-301
 
TNX-301 is a fixed-dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline. We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations. A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD. At that meeting, the FDA advised us of the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301. IND planning activities are underway.

TNX-701
 
In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701. We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701. Similar to the regulatory pathway intended for TNX-801, we plan to develop TNX-701 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, or the “Animal Rule”. We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level. Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
 
The markets for medicines to treat PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies. GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil®) and Pfizer (Zoloft®) market FDA-approved drugs for PTSD. Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
 
Certain other companies and institutions are known to be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Bionomics (BNC-201), Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti® [brexpiprazole]), Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (riluzole) and the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]). BNC-201 is in Phase 2 for civilian PTSD and is an allosteric modulator of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Rexulti is in Phase 2 for PTSD and is an atypical antipsychotic. Riluzole is in a Phase 2 trial for active duty military members and veterans with PTSD and is a blocker of certain sodium channels and a modulator of the glutamatergic system. MDMA is Phase 3 ready for PTSD and is a Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, schedule 1 hallucinogen that is being studied for drug-assisted psychotherapy. Brainsway Ltd., a medical device company, is currently recruiting patients for a pivotal Phase 3 trial using a deep transcranial magnetic stimulation device. A number of other companies have or may be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Actavis, Johnson and Johnson, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Merck, and Pfizer. Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include: anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone. Additionally, a number of companies are working on vaccines/treatments for smallpox, including Bavarian Nordic, SIGA and Chimerix. Bavarian Nordic is developing Modified Virus Ankara, or MVA, which is a vaccine. SIGA is developing Arestvy® (tecovirimat), which is an antiviral. Chimerix is developing brincidofovir (CMX001), which is an antiviral.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use. As of March 31, 2017, the patents we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to include three issued U.S. patents and 16 issued non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing an additional 15 U.S. patent applications, of which four are provisional and 11 are non-provisional, one international patent application, and 71 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.
 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 
Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the PTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
 
The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
 
The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of March 31, 2017 are summarized below.
 
TNX-102 SL — CNS
 
Our patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL includes patent applications directed to compositions of matter of CBP, formulations containing CBP, and methods for treating CNS conditions utilizing these compositions and formulations. U.S. Patent No. 9,474,728 is expected to expire in 2031, excluding any patent term extensions.
 
 Certain eutectic compositions were discovered by development partners and are termed the “Eutectic Technology.” The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the Eutectic Technology includes patent applications directed to eutectic compositions containing CBP, eutectic CBP formulations, methods for treating PTSD and other CNS conditions utilizing eutectic CBP compositions and formulations, and methods of manufacturing eutectic CBP compositions. The Eutectic Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. patent applications, such as U.S. Patent Application No. 14/214,433. If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034 or 2035, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
On March 10, 2017, we received a notice of allowance from the PTO for the US patent No. 14/214,433 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride,” which includes compositions of cyclobenzaprine HCl and methods of manufacturing the eutectic. The allowed claims will protect the pharmaceutical composition since it is based on the eutectic. The allowed claims will also protect the method of manufacturing the eutectic. Eutectic tablets containing cyclobenzaprine HCl and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability. A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal lattice. The distance between the molecular units is not changed.
 
The unique pharmacokinetic profile of TNX-102 SL was discovered by Tonix and its development partners and is termed the “PK Technology.” The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the PK Technology includes patent applications directed to compositions of matter of CBP, formulations containing CBP, and methods for treating PTSD and other CNS conditions utilizing these compositions and formulations. The PK Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 13/918,692. If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2033, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
TNX-601 — PTSD
 
Our patent portfolio for tianeptine oxalate includes U.S. provisional Patent Application No. 62/439,533. It includes claims directed to composition, including pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use.

TNX-801 — Live HPXV Vaccine for Prevention of Smallpox
 
We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, TNX-801, a live HPXV that is a new vaccine candidate against smallpox. We have patent applications directed to synthetic chimeric poxviruses and methods of using these poxviruses to protect individuals against smallpox. These applications include U.S. provisional Patent Application Nos. 62/416,577 and 62/434,794. We also own the rights to develop some different vaccine candidates against smallpox. With respect to this smallpox vaccine candidate, we own U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights. The smallpox vaccine technologies relate to proprietary forms of live HPXV and vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease. We believe that this technology, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
 
TNX-301 — Alcohol Use Disorders 
 
Our patent portfolio for disulfiram and selegiline combinations includes patents and patent applications. It includes claims directed to disulfiram and selegiline, pharmaceutical compositions containing disulfiram and selegiline, disulfiram and selegiline formulations, methods of treating AUD, and methods of modulating alcohol abuse and dependence. It includes issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,300 and 8,481,599. The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
TNX-701 — Radioprotection Biodefense Technology
 
We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, which is a potential radioprotective therapy. For protection of intellectual property, we have not disclosed the identity of the new development candidate.
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.

We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing. For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial. Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.
 
All of our small molecules drug candidates are synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
 
Our smallpox-preventing vaccine candidate is a biologic uses live form of HPXV. Both the drug substance (horsepox virus and the cell bank) and the drug product (vaccine) will be manufactured by contract cGMP-compliant facilities capable of manufacturing for nonclinical/clinical testing and licensed product.
 
Government Regulations
 
The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
 
The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products, or a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for biologic products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.

Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety. Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations. Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
New Drug Applications
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product. An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.

Section 505(b) NDAs
 
There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates. We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future. A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA’s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs. Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA. The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant’s drug and the reference drug. In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA. As such, we plan to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for PTSD. The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for PTSD as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. If the FDA determines that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA is not appropriate and that a full NDA is required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved. If the FDA requires a full NDA for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted. If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
 
Patent Protections
 
An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug. With respect to every patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book, which is the FDA’s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
 
If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
 
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.

Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market. The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety. This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period. However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7½ years after the NCE approval date. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria. They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed. FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation –Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:

• | intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD. The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was submitted based on the preliminary clinical evidence of TNX 102-SL on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
 
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA within six months instead of 10 months and rolling submission of portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA's senior managers contributing significant guidance. The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our drug development program.

Material Threat Medical Countermeasures
 
In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation. One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at “Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.” The Act created a new priority review voucher program for “material threat medical countermeasures.” The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent. The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism. A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10 months to 6 months. The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it. We intend to seek a priority voucher for TNX-801 as a material threat medical countermeasure.
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:

• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | drug sampling and distribution requirements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
 
The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
The Impact of New Legislation and Amendments to Existing Laws
 
 The FDCA is subject to routine legislative amendments with a broad range of downstream effects. In addition to new legislation, such as the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, or the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012, Congress introduces amendments to reauthorize drug user fees and address emerging concerns every five years. We cannot predict the impact of these new legislative acts and their implementing regulations on our business. The programs established or to be established under the legislation may have adverse effects upon us, including increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. In addition, the FDA’s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act establishes a number of requirements, such as the public disclosure of information on experimental treatments, which may be costly and take time to implement. Additionally, the current legislative authority for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act expires in September 2017. The requirements and changes imposed by the legislation to reauthorize the act may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
