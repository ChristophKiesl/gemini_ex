Item 1.    Business.
​
Overview
​
As of December 31, 2022, we were a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 20, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”).
Our registration statements for our initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”) became effective on July 15, 2020. On July 20, 2020, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 25,300,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 3,300,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $253,000,000.
​
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 7,060,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a Private Placement to the Sponsor (the “Private Placement”), generating gross proceeds of $7,060,000.
​
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on July 20, 2020, an amount of $253,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our shareholders, as described below.
​
As of December 31, 2022, our Class A common stock, warrants and units traded on the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”) under the symbols “HPX,” “HPX.WS” and “HPX.U,” respectively. Our units commenced public trading on July 16, 2020 and our Class A common stock and warrants commenced separate public trading on September 5, 2020. On March 3, 2023, the NYSE American filed a Form 25 (Notification of Removal from Listing) with the SEC relating to the delisting of our units, Class A common stock and warrants. As a result, our units, Class A common stock and warrants are no longer listed on the NYSE American.
Combination Period Extensions
As previously reported in the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 14, 2022, on July 14, 2022, in connection with its Extraordinary General Meeting held on July 14, 2022 (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”), the Company’s shareholders approved: (1) a special resolution to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company (the “Extension Amendment”) to extend the date by which the Company must (a) consummate a Business Combination, (b) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such Business Combination, and (c) redeem all of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in the Company’s Initial Public Offering from July 20, 2022 to November 20, 2022; and (2) the proposal to extend the date on which Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”) must liquidate the trust account established in connection with the Company’s Initial Public Offering if the Company has not completed its initial Business Combination from July 20, 2022 to November 20, 2022 (the “Trust Amendment” and, together with the Extension Amendment, the “Initial Extension”).
On November 3, 2022, in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved an additional extension of the Combination Period from November 20, 2022 to March 31, 2023 (the “Additional Extension”).

Ambipar Emergency Response Business Combination
On the Closing Date, the Company consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, by and among the Company, AMBI, Merger Sub, Emergencia, and Ambipar.
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, one business day before the Closing Date, Ambipar contributed all of the issued and outstanding equity of Emergencia into Merger Sub in exchange for the newly issued ordinary shares of Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Ordinary Shares”). On the Closing Date, (i) the Company merged with and into AMBI, with AMBI as the surviving entity (the “First Merger” and the effective time of the First Merger, the “First Effective Time”) and (ii) immediately following the First Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into AMBI, with AMBI as the surviving entity and holding all of the issued and outstanding equity of Emergencia (the “Second Merger” and the effective time of the Second Merger, the “Second Effective Time”; the Second Merger together with the First Merger, the “Mergers;” and the Mergers, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”).
As part of the Business Combination, at the First Effective Time: (i) each issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Share, was canceled and converted into the right to receive one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of AMBI (the “AMBI Class A Ordinary Shares”); (ii) each issued and outstanding whole warrant to purchase the Class A Ordinary Shares was converted into one warrant to purchase one AMBI Class A Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Warrants”), subject to the same terms and conditions existing prior to such conversion, and (iii) each outstanding and unvested restricted stock unit in respect of Class A Ordinary Shares was converted into a restricted stock unit settled in AMBI Class A Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such restricted stock units of the Company as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time.
Additionally, at the Second Effective Time, each issued and outstanding Merger Sub Ordinary Share was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration comprised of Class B ordinary shares of AMBI, par value $0.0001 per share, which carry voting rights in the form of 10 votes per share of AMBI (the “AMBI Class B Ordinary Shares” and, together with AMBI Class A Ordinary Shares, the “AMBI Ordinary Shares”), as determined in accordance with the per share consideration set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; provided that the number of AMBI Class B Ordinary Shares issued to Ambipar was adjusted downwards by $3,572,446, which is the amount corresponding, at one share for every $10.00, to the transaction expenses incurred by Emergencia in excess of $9,500,000 not reimbursed by Ambipar pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement.
The Business Combination was unanimously approved by the Company’s board of directors and was approved at the extraordinary general meeting of the Company’s shareholders held on February 28, 2023 (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”).
