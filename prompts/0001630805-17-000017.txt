Item 1. Business
In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise indicates, "B&W," "we," "us," the "Company" and "our" mean Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated and combined subsidiaries.
B&W is a leading technology-based provider of advanced fossil and renewable power generation and environmental equipment that includes a broad suite of boiler products, environmental systems, and services for power and industrial uses. We specialize in technology and engineering for power generation and various other industries, the related procurement, erection and specialty manufacturing of equipment, and the provision of related services, including: 

• | high-pressure equipment for energy conversion, such as boilers fueled by coal, oil, bitumen, natural gas, and renewables including municipal solid waste and biomass fuels;


• | environmental control systems for both power generation and industrial applications to incinerate, filter, capture, recover and/or purify air, liquid and vapor-phase effluents from a variety of power generation and specialty manufacturing processes;


• | aftermarket support for the global installed base of operating plants with a wide variety of products and technical services including replacement parts, retrofit and upgrade capabilities, field engineering, construction, inspection, operations and maintenance, condition assessment and other technical support;

• | engineered-to-order services, products and systems for energy conversion worldwide and related auxiliary equipment, such as burners, pulverizers, soot blowers and ash and material handling systems.

We operate in three reportable segments: Power, Renewable and Industrial. Through our Power segment, we provide the supply of and aftermarket services for steam-generating, environmental, and auxiliary equipment for power generation and other industrial applications. Through our Renewable segment, we supply steam-generating systems, environmental and auxiliary equipment for the waste-to-energy and biomass power generation industries. Our Industrial segment provides custom-engineered environmental solutions, industrial equipment and aftermarket parts and services through 
Babcock & Wilcox MEGTEC Holdings, Inc. ("MEGTEC"), and provides custom-engineered comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets through SPIG S.p.A. ("SPIG"), which we acquired on July 1, 2016. See Note 5 in our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information about our segments.
Our overall activity depends significantly on the capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenditures of global electric power generating companies, other steam-using industries and industrial facilities with environmental compliance and noise abatement needs. Several factors influence these expenditures, including: 

• | prices for electricity, along with the cost of production and distribution including the cost of fuel within the United States or internationally;


• | demand for electricity and other end products of steam-generating facilities;


• | requirements for environmental and noise abatement improvements;


• | expectation of future requirements to further limit or reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions in the United States and internationally;


• | environmental policies which include waste-to-energy or biomass as options to meet legislative requirements and clean energy portfolio standards;

1


• | level of capacity utilization at operating power plants and other industrial uses of steam production;


• | requirements for maintenance and upkeep at operating power plants to combat the accumulated effects of usage;


• | overall strength of the industrial industry; and


• | ability of electric power generating companies and other steam users to raise capital.

Customer demand is heavily affected by the variations in our customers' business cycles and by the overall economies and energy, environmental and noise abatement needs of the countries in which they operate. 
On June 8, 2015, the board of directors of The Babcock & Wilcox Company (now known as BWX Technologies, Inc.) ("BWC" or the "former Parent") approved the spin-off of B&W through the distribution of shares of B&W common stock to holders of BWC common stock. The distribution of B&W common stock was made on June 30, 2015, and consisted of one share of B&W common stock for every two shares of BWC common stock to holders of BWC common stock as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the record date, June 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of B&W common stock. On June 30, 2015, B&W became a separate publicly traded company, and BWC did not retain any ownership interest in B&W. We filed our Form 10 describing the spin-off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on June 16, 2015. The spin-off is further described in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8.
Our Business Strategies
B&W is a leading technology-based provider of advanced fossil and renewable power generation equipment with a broad suite of new build boiler and environmental products. We provide a comprehensive platform of aftermarket services to a large global installed base of power generation facilities. In addition, B&W is a leading provider of technology and services in the growing market for industrial environmental and noise abatement systems. Across all of our capabilities, we specialize in engineering, specialty manufacturing, procurement and erection of equipment and technology for a large and global customer base. 
Business Segments
Our assessment of operating results is based on three reportable segments, which changed during the third quarter of 2016. Our reportable segments are as follows:
Power segment
Our Power segment focuses on the supply of and aftermarket services for steam-generating, environmental, and auxiliary equipment for power generation and other industrial applications. The segment provides a comprehensive mix of aftermarket products and services to support peak efficiency and availability of steam generating and associated environmental and auxiliary equipment, serving large steam generating utility and industrial customers globally. Our products and services include replacement parts, field technical services, retrofit and upgrade projects, fuel switching and repowering projects, construction and maintenance services, start-up and commissioning, training programs and plant operations and maintenance for our full complement of boiler, environmental and auxiliary equipment. Our auxiliary equipment includes boiler cleaning equipment and material handling equipment.
Our worldwide new build boiler and environmental products businesses serve large steam generating and industrial customers. The segment provides a full suite of product and service offerings including engineering, procurement, specialty manufacturing, construction and commissioning. The segment's boilers include utility boilers and industrial boilers fired with coal and natural gas. Our boiler products include advanced supercritical boilers, subcritical boilers, fluidized bed boilers, chemical recovery boilers, industrial power boilers, package boilers, heat recovery steam generators and waste heat boilers.
Our environmental systems offerings include air pollution control products and related equipment for the treatment of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate, mercury, acid gases and other hazardous air emissions, including carbon dioxide capture and sequestration technologies, wet and dry flue gas desulfurization systems, catalytic and non-catalytic 
2

nitrogen oxides reduction systems, low nitrogen oxides burners and overfire air systems, fabric filter baghouses, wet and dry electrostatic precipitators, mercury control systems and dry sorbent injection for acid gas mitigation.
The segment also receives license fees and royalty payments through licensing agreements of our proprietary technologies.
While opportunities to increase revenues in the segment are limited, we are striving to grow margins by:

• | selectively bid projects in emerging international markets needing state-of-the-art technology for fossil power generation and environmental systems;


• | growing sales of industrial steam generation products in the petrochemical and pulp & paper markets, such as heat recovery, natural gas and oil fired package boilers, due in part to lower fuel prices;


• | continuing our strong service presence in support of our installed fleet of steam generation equipment and expand support of other OEM equipment; and


• | reducing costs through a focus on operational efficiencies.

We focus our research dollars on improving our products for the markets we serve through: (i) cost reductions resulting in more competitive products in a highly competitive global market and margin improvement; (ii) reduced performance risk assuring our products meet our and our customers' expectations; and (iii) standards development and updates, which results in lower engineering hours consumed on projects and enables us to sublet engineering to low cost engineering centers of excellence. 
Our Power segment generated revenues of $975.5 million, $1,235.0 million and $1,156.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was 61.8%, 70.3% and 77.8% of our total revenues in those years, respectively.
Renewable segment
Our Renewable segment provides steam-generating systems, environmental and auxiliary equipment for the waste-to-energy and biomass power generation industries, and plant operations and maintenance services for our full complement of systems and equipment. We deliver these products and services to a large base of customers primarily in Europe through our extensive network of technical support personnel and global sourcing capabilities. Our customers consist of traditional, renewable and carbon neutral power utility companies that require steam generation and environmental control technologies to enable beneficial use of municipal waste and biomass. This segment's activity is dependent on the demand for electricity and ultimately the capacity utilization and associated operations and maintenance expenditures of waste-to-energy power generating companies and other industries that use steam to generate energy.
Globally, efforts to reduce the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels may create opportunities for us as existing generating capacity is replaced with cleaner technologies. We expect growth in backlog in the second half of 2017 and beyond, primarily from renewable waste-to-energy projects, as we continue to see numerous opportunities around the globe, although the rate of backlog growth is dependent on many external factors. We have elected to limit bidding any additional Renewable contracts that involve our European resources for at least the first six months of 2017 as we work through our existing contracts. 
Our Renewable segment generated revenues of $349.2 million, $338.6 million and $224.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was 22.1%, 19.3% and 15.1% of our total revenues in those years, respectively.
Industrial segment
Through December 31, 2016, our Industrial segment was comprised of our MEGTEC and SPIG businesses. The segment is focused on custom-engineered cooling, environmental, noise abatement and industrial equipment along with related aftermarket services. 
Through MEGTEC, we provide environmental products and services to numerous industrial end markets. MEGTEC designs, engineers and manufactures products including oxidizers, solvent and distillation systems, wet electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers and heat recovery systems. MEGTEC also provides specialized industrial process systems, coating lines and equipment. MEGTEC's suite of technologies for pollution abatement includes systems that control volatile organic compounds and air toxins, particulate, nitrogen oxides and acid gas air emissions from industrial processes. MEGTEC serves a diverse set of industrial end markets globally with a current emphasis on the chemical, pharmaceutical, energy storage, packaging, and automotive markets. MEGTEC's activity is dependent primarily on the capacity utilization of operating 
3

industrial plants and an increased emphasis on environmental emissions globally across a broad range of industries and markets.
We acquired SPIG on July 1, 2016. It provides custom-engineered cooling systems, services and aftermarket products. SPIG’s product offerings include air-cooled (dry) cooling systems, mechanical draft wet cooling towers and natural draft wet cooling hyperbolic towers. SPIG also provides end-to-end aftermarket services, including spare parts, upgrades/revamps for existing installations and remote monitoring. SPIG's comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket products and services are primarily provided to the power generation industry, including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, and downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets in the Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. SPIG's activity is dependent primarily on global energy demand from utilities and other industrial plants, regulatory requirements, water scarcity and energy efficiency needs.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, Universal Acoustic & Emission Technologies, Inc. ("Universal"), which we acquired on January 11, 2017, will be added to the Industrial segment. We expect that our acquisition of Universal will complement the product and service offerings we are able to provide through our Industrial segment. Universal provides custom-engineered acoustic, emission and filtration solutions to the natural gas power generation, mid-stream natural gas pipeline, locomotive and general industrial end-markets. Universal’s product offering includes gas turbine inlet and exhaust systems, custom silencers, filters and custom enclosures. Historically, almost all of Universal's activity has been in the United States. With the integration of Universal with the Industrial segment, we expect its business will grow globally with the benefit of B&W's global network of current and future customers and the evolving needs of noise abatement controls in the industrial market. 
We see opportunities for growth in revenues in the Industrial segment relating to a variety of factors. Our new equipment customers purchase equipment as part of major capacity expansions, to replace existing equipment, or in response to regulatory initiatives. Additionally, our significant installed base provides a consistent and recurring aftermarket stream of parts, retrofits and services. Major investments in global chemical markets have strengthened demand for our industrial equipment, while tightening environmental and noise abatement regulations in the United States, China, India and other developing countries are creating new opportunities. We foresee long-term trends toward increased environmental and noise abatement controls for industrial manufacturers around the world. Together, the companies that comprise the Industrial segment are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in these markets. 
Our Industrial segment generated revenues of $253.6 million, $183.7 million and $105.4 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was 16.1%, 10.4% and 7.1% of our total revenues in those years, respectively.
Acquisitions
Since our spin-off, we have pursued a strategy to acquire businesses that meet our long-term growth and diversification objectives. Our acquisition focus is primarily on companies that would complement our Industrial segment. To date, we have completed two such acquisitions, which are summarized below: 
On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of SPIG. Based in Arona, Italy, SPIG is a global provider of custom-engineered comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets. See Note 4 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information. 
On January 11, 2017, we acquired Universal for approximately $55 million in cash, funded primarily by borrowings under our United States revolving credit facility. Based in Wisconsin, Universal is a bolt-on acquisition for MEGTEC. Universal provides custom-engineered acoustic, emission and filtration solutions to the natural gas power generation, mid-stream natural gas pipeline, locomotive and general industrial end-markets. Universal’s product offering includes gas turbine inlet and exhaust systems, custom silencers, filters and custom enclosures. See Note 30 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.
Joint Ventures
We participate in the ownership of a variety of entities with third parties, primarily through corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships, which we refer to as "joint ventures." We enter into joint ventures primarily for specific market access and to enhance our manufacturing, design and global production operations as well as reduce operating and financial 
4

risk profiles. We generally account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. Our unconsolidated joint ventures are described below. 

• | Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Company, Ltd. ("BWBC") We own equal interests in this entity with Beijing Jingcheng Machinery Electric Holding Company, Ltd. BWBC was formed in 1986 and is located in Beijing, China. Its main activities are the design, manufacture, production and sale of various power plant and industrial boilers. BWBC expands our markets internationally and provides additional manufacturing capacity to our boiler products.


• | Thermax Babcock & Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited ("TBWES") In June 2010, one of our subsidiaries and Thermax Ltd., a boiler manufacturer based in India, formed a joint venture to build subcritical and highly efficient supercritical boilers and pulverizers for the Indian utility boiler market. We have licensed to TBWES our technology for subcritical boilers 300 MW and larger, highly efficient supercritical boilers and coal pulverizers. In 2013, TBWES finalized construction of a facility in India designed to produce parts for up to 3,000 MW of utility boiler capacity per year.


• | Other Project Related Ventures From time to time, we partner with other companies to better meet the needs of our customers, which can result in project-related joint venture entities. Examples of this include BWM Ottumwa Environmental Partners, where we formed a joint venture with Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc., to engineer, procure, and construct environmental control systems for the Ottumwa Generating Station, a United States based project that was substantially completed in 2014. We also formed BWL Energy Ltd. with Lagan to complete the construction of the Teesside waste wood fired boiler project in the United Kingdom. This joint venture combines our expertise in the waste-to-energy power plant design, engineering, procurement and construction with our partner's civil construction capability to provide a full turnkey product to our customer.


• | Halley & Mellowes Pty. Ltd. ("HMA") Diamond Power International, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, owned an interest in this Australian company, which was formed in 1984. HMA manufactures, sells and services a wide range of capital plant equipment to a diverse range of industries including the mining, processing, materials handling, water management, power generation, and oil and gas industries. On December 22, 2016, we sold all of our joint venture interest in HMA for $18.0 million, resulting in a gain of $8.3 million.

Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable or some combination of these methods. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, plant or equipment availability, efficiency, safety record and reputation.
Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed amount to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work. For further specification see "Risk Factors Related to Our Business – We are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in our industry, including the risk that, if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed-price contracts, our profitability will decline, and we may suffer losses" as detailed in Item 1A of this report.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices.
We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accordingly, we review contract price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material. 
Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve significant amounts for contract security.
5

In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Other sales, such as parts and certain aftermarket service activities, are not in the form of long-term contracts, and we recognize revenues as goods are delivered and work is performed.
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same fiscal period. 
Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be canceled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. Additionally, because we operate globally, our backlog is also affected by changes in foreign currencies. 
We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customer to payment for work performed. Accordingly, we exclude from backlog orders or arrangements that have been awarded but that we have not been authorized to begin performance. 
We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. See Note 7 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report for financial information on our equity method investments. 
Our backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

(in millions) | December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015
Power segment | $ | 615 | | | $ | 803 
Renewable segment | 1,241 | | | 1,458 | 
Industrial segment | 216 | | | 67 | 
Total backlog | $ | 2,072 | | | $ | 2,328

Of the December 31, 2016 backlog, we expect to recognize approximate revenues as follows:

(in millions) | 2017 | | 2018 | | Thereafter | | Total
Power segment | $ | 369 | | | $ | 94 | | $ | 152 | $ | 615 
Renewable segment | 348 | | | 191 | | | 702 | | 1,241
Industrial segment | 172 | | | 40 | | | 3 | | 216 
 | $ | 889 | | | $ | 326 | | $ | 858 | $ | 2,072

Foreign Operations
Our operations in Denmark provide comprehensive services to companies in the waste-to-energy and biomass energy sector of the power generation market, primarily in Europe. Our operations in Italy provide custom-engineered comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket parts and services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets. Our operations in Scotland provide boiler cleaning technologies and systems (such as sootblowers). Our operations in Germany provide a variety of ash and material handling solutions, from completely dry bottom ash handling to fly ash and petroleum coke processing. Our Canadian operations serve the Canadian industrial power, oil production and electric utility markets. We also have manufacturing facilities in Mexico to serve global markets. 
6

Our joint ventures in China and India primarily serve the power generation needs of their local domestic and other utility markets, but both joint ventures participate as manufacturing partners on certain of our foreign projects. 
The functional currency of our foreign operating entities is not the United States dollar, and as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues, see Note 5 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report.
Customers
We provide our products and services to a diverse customer base that includes utilities and other power producers located around the world. We have no customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated and combined revenues in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Competition
With 150 years of experience, we have supplied highly engineered energy and environmental equipment in over 90 countries. We have a competitive advantage in our experience and technical capability to reliably convert a wide range of fuels to steam. Our strong, installed base around the globe also yields competitive advantages, although our markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies specializing in power generation, environmental, and cooling systems and services. Each segment's primary competitors are summarized as follows:

Power segment | Renewable segment | Industrial segment 
GE | CNIM Group | B&W SPIG primary competitors 
Doosan | Hitachi Zosen | Hamon, Enexio, Kelvion, Paharpur, Evapco, Sonder
Babcock Power | Martin | B&W MEGTEC primary competitors 
Amec Foster Wheeler | Keppel Seghers | Durr, Dustex, CECO, Eisenmann 
MH Power Systems | Valmet | B&W Universal primary competitors 
 | Andritz | Braden, CECO, Innova, Miratech 

Across each of our segments, we also compete with a variety of engineering and construction companies related to installation of steam generating systems and environmental control equipment; specialized industrial equipment; and other suppliers of replacement parts, repair and alteration services and other services required to retrofit and maintain existing steam generating systems. The primary bases of competition are price, technical capabilities, quality, timeliness of performance, breadth of products and services and willingness to accept project risks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed from time to time, no serious shortage exists at the present time. 
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, not including 2,500 joint venture employees. Of our hourly employees, approximately 1,000 are union-affiliated, covered by ten union agreements related to active facilities in Canada, China, Denmark, Great Britain, Mexico, and United States. Most of our union agreements expire in 2017 or 2018, and we are actively negotiating new agreements. We consider our relationships with our employees and unions to be in good standing. 
7

Patents and Licenses
We currently hold a large number of United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We have acquired patents and technology licenses and granted technology licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses. 
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities are related to the development and improvement of new and existing products and equipment, as well as conceptual and engineering evaluation for translation into practical applications. Research and development costs unrelated to specific contracts are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses totaled $10.4 million, $16.5 million and $18.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Permits and Licenses
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors. We are not aware of any material noncompliance and believe our operations and certifications are currently in compliance with all relevant permits, licenses and certifications. 
Environmental
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"). CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our combined financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
