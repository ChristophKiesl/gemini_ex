On April 28, 2017, the Company entered into a Software License Agreement with Finger Motion Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, (“Finger Motion”) that provides the Company the worldwide license to market and sell several role-playing video games. Role playing video games (RPGs) are a specific video game genre in which the player controls the actions of a game character (and/or several characters) that are immersed in a well-defined world. Finger Motion has developed and/or acquired the rights to at least three such RPGs, currently marketed, or soon to be marketed, in the People’s Republic of China. The license is for an initial term of 10 years with subsequent 5-year extensions at the option of the parties. The Company shall assume all cost and expenses incurred with the acquisition, registration of, and performance of this license. As consideration for the license, the Company agreed to issue to three principals of Finger Motion, Cheong Chee Ming, Cheong Leong Foong and Liew Siew Chin, 40,000, 30,000 and 30,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, or a total of 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of common stock and has the voting power of 200 common shares on matters submitted to shareholders for voting purposes. This results in giving the principals of Finger Motion the voting power of an aggregate of 20 million shares of common stock of the Company (please refer to Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2017.) 
 
On May 15, 2017, the Company received the written consent in lieu of a meeting of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding voting capital of the Company that authorized amending the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the basis of one (1) post-Split share of Common Stock for every four (4) pre-Split shares of Common Stock, to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 18,000,000, to 200,000,000, and to change the name of the Company from Property Management Corporation of America to FingerMotion, Inc. As of June 13, 2017, none of these amendments have gone into effect.
