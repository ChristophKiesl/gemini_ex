ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Introduction
Inpixon is the Indoor Intelligence™ company. Our business and government customers use our solutions to secure, digitize and optimize their indoor spaces with our positioning, mapping, and analytics products. Inpixon’s Indoor Intelligence platform uses sensor technology to detect active cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ultra-wide band (“UWB”) and Chirp Spread Spectrum (“chirp”) signals emitted from devices within a venue providing positional information similar to what global positioning system (“GPS”) satellite systems provide for the outdoors. Combining this positional data with our dynamic and interactive mapping solution and a high-performance analytics engine, we are able to offer our customers near real-time insights for increased visibility, security and business intelligence throughout their indoor spaces. Our highly configurable platform can also ingest data from our customers’ and other third-party sensors, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth beacons, video cameras, and big data sources, among others, to maximize indoor intelligence. 
Our Indoor Intelligence offerings consist of a variety of software and hardware products for positioning, mapping, and analytics offerings.
Positioning 
•Our solutions provide positioning and wireless device detection that cultivates situational awareness by leveraging sensors with proprietary technology that can detect and position active cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UWB and chirp signals throughout a venue, as well as GPS technologies. These products allows for the positioning of people and assets homogeneously as they travel between the indoor and outdoor. Utilizing various radio signal technologies permits device positioning with accuracy ranging from several meters down to approximately thirty centimeters, depending on the product deployed and conditions in the indoor space. The technology allows for detailed understanding of space and resource utilization, and in security applications, detection and identification of authorized and unauthorized devices, prevention of rogue devices through alert notification based on rules when unknown devices are detected in restricted areas and asset tracking with centimeter level precision. 
•We also provide on-device positioning using internal sensors in smart phones and other IoT wearable devices. The location data is ingested by the positioning system generating accurate coordinates which are displayed on an indoor map. Our on-device indoor positioning solution enables a smartphone’s precise location to be displayed to a user in a mobile app. Data is combined from various sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, compass, GPS and BLE radio scanning, to position the blue dot and to correct for drift. Enabling powerful location-based use cases, our patented on-device technology runs on a smartphone, smartwatch or other IoT wearable device and can operate without the internet. 
•Our RTLS (real time location systems) or asset tracking is based on our UWB or chirp anchors and tags. Chirp technology is effective for longer range communication while UWB is an important RF standard for pinpoint asset tracking. Organizations across many different industries can leverage the accuracy, quickness, and reliability of UWB technology to track the real-time location and status of key assets and equipment, with greater precision. Users can display and track the location and movement of static and moving assets and asset attribute information within a space on high-fidelity, layer-based indoor maps and navigate to assets that are both fixed and in motion. 
Mapping
•Our indoor mapping platform provides enterprise organizations with the tools to add intelligence to complex indoor spaces by integrating business data with indoor maps. Our mapping platform gives developers the flexibility and control to create tailored map-enabled solutions that address multiple use cases with a single platform. Comprised of software development tools and a web-based content management system (CMS), our mapping platform is highly configurable and able to address the varying security, extensibility and versatility needs of our customers. 
Analytics
•Data science analytics, on-premises or in the cloud, along with specially optimized algorithms that are intended to increase the accuracy of location data and maximize system performance. This enables the system to deliver data reporting and visualizations to the user based on our mapping platform. We also provide data output that can be 
integrated with common third-party visualization, charting, graphing and dashboard systems. Our analytics capabilities allow for the integration of a customer’s existing video surveillance feed with location data collected via radio frequency, enabling customers to ascertain radio frequency coverage and access evidentiary information that can be used for security and customer relations programs. 
We can assist a variety of private and public organizations, including corporate enterprises, government agencies, hotels and resorts, gaming operators, airports, healthcare facilities, manufacturing, construction, mining, agriculture and livestock companies, to create smarter, safer and more secure environments.

Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled approximately $6.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
We utilize direct sales and marketing through approximately 26 sales representatives, who are compensated with a base salary and, in certain instances, may participate in incentive plans such as commissions or bonuses. We also utilize webinars, conferences, tradeshows and other direct and indirect marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. We also have relationships with channel partners to directly engage with customers, to perform the installation as well as manufacturers (OEM) and systems integrators to assist with the implementation of certain of our products and services. We 
train our partners and we have our own channel/partner managers to support and augment partners as needed. We are in the process of expanding our channel partners in both commercial and government markets.
Our Inpixon products are primarily sold on a license (up-front one-time fee) or software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. In our licensing model, we also typically charge an annual maintenance fee. The SaaS model is typically for a 2-3 year contract and includes maintenance upgrades. The SaaS model generates a recurring revenue stream. Our Shoom product is on a monthly subscription model based on 2-3 year contracts. SAVES products are sold as annual or perpetual licenses along with maintenance subscriptions.
Customers
The Company’s customers include shopping malls, corporate offices, healthcare facilities, government agencies, local publications, among others. Our top three customers accounted for approximately 43% and 66% of our gross revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. One customer accounted for 26% of our gross revenue in 2020 and 42% in 2019. From time to time, one or two customers can represent a significant portion of our revenue as a result of one-time projects.
Competition
Our products compete with positioning companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Mist Networks/Juniper Networks, Aislelabs and Bluevision/HID. For our mapping product, we compete with companies such as MappedIn and Mapwize. For asset tracking, we compete with Zebra Technologies, Stanley Healthcare and other mostly vertical focused RTLS companies. The positioning companies primarily offer only Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth detection and, therefore, we believe they cannot achieve the same accuracy and comprehensive detection that we do. We have partnered with or replaced some of these companies because we offer Wi-Fi, cellular, RFID, UWB and Bluetooth and have several meters to centimeter level location accuracy depending on the product. Most of the companies above are focused on one product and/or vertical and, at this time, we believe none of them have the complete offering of positioning, mapping, RTLS and analytics.
Mobile device management companies like AirWatch and MobileIron have also integrated with us instead of developing competing products. MerlinOne and PressTeligence compete with the functionality of our Shoom products, but typically provide information only for the specific customer and not for the customer’s competitors or for the industry.
We believe we offer a unique and differentiated approach to the market with our indoor intelligence offering which is:
•Comprehensive. We integrate a myriad of indoor data inputs and outputs. The technology supports a multitude of use cases including asset tracking, navigation, facility management, analytics, and security across numerous industries in both the private and public sector.
