Recent Developments
 
Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule
 
On August 30, 2016, the Company received a written alert from Nasdaq Listing Qualifications that our listed security has not regained compliance with the minimum $1 bid price per share requirement, within the 180 calendar days. However, the Staff has determined that the Company is eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(a). If at any time during this 180 day period the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, we will regain compliance. In order to regain compliance, we may have to affect a reverse stock-split. If we are required to effect a reverse stock-split, it would have to be completed at least 10 days prior to the expiration of the date by which we must regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2).
 
On February 28, 2017, the Company  received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) stating that the Staff has determined, unless the Company timely requests an appeal of the Staff’s determination, before Nasdaq’s Hearing Panel (the “Panel”), by March 7, 2017, to delist the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company is not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement (the “Minimum Bid Price”) for continued listing set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Company filed a request for a hearing before the Panel, on March 2, 2017, which request will stay any delisting or suspension action by the Staff pending the issuance of the Panel’s decision and the expiration of any extension granted by the Panel.
 
On March 3, 2017, the Staff informed the Company that they were granted a hearing to be held on April 20, 2017 (the “Hearing”). As such, the delisting action, referenced above, has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel at the Hearing.
 
At the Hearing, we will present its plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price by effecting a reverse stock split. On March 20, 2017, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with special meeting of stockholders (the “Stockholders’ Meeting”) to be held on April 14, 2017.  The proposal being submitted is for a vote of the stockholders at the Stockholders’ Meeting is the approval of a 6 to 1 reverse stock split of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. Management believes that effecting the reverse stock split will allow our common stock to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which should allow the Company’s common stock to continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Assuming the reverse stock split proposal is approved by the Company’s stockholders, the Company’s board of directors currently intends to effect the reverse stock split immediately after the Stockholders’ Meeting, unless it determines that doing so would not have the desired effect of satisfying the Minimum Bid Price requirement.

Industry
 
Rapid Growth in Global Mobile Voice over IP Service Market
 
We aim to deliver our patented smartphone software to the ever expanding mobile Voice over IP (“mVoIP”) user. By 2019 there are expected to be over 2.7 billion smartphones consumers, or more than one-third of all people worldwide (Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide. Each new smartphone represents an opportunity for us to deliver our innovative mobile VoIP, Messaging over IP and Advertising over IP solution in whatever mobile app brand is attractive to the end user throughout the globe.
 
By partnering with national carriers and delivering our solution as a licensed service to regional mobile operators, we leverage the power of their brand and join them to fight back against already lost revenues, or potential revenue loss, to network bandwidth-intensive Over The Top (“OTT”) VoIP apps; such as SkypeTM in the USA or LineTM in Japan and the like.
 
In the past mobile operators relied upon blocking VoIP on their networks but they have realized that this is no longer a viable option. They must embrace innovations in VoIP software, especially on the smartphone, from businesses like ours. Not only can we offer a multi-media, multi-faceted software solution to smartphones, but we are the only company that offers a package that aids the operators in the rollout, expansion, maintenance and upgrade of their mobile network in metro and rural areas to cater for smartphones.
 
From the beginning of the first smartphones in 2008, our software was specifically targeted to be a disruptive technology, which was and has been explicitly designed, and patented, to work on congested wireless Internet connections; the absolute fundamental basis of mobile phones in 2016 and beyond.
 
As more and more smartphones come online, each one places a significantly higher load on the existing cellular infrastructure; as smartphone users now use smartphone to check for emails, surf the Internet, check the weather, read the news, etc. while in the past, all a mobile phone did was calling and Short Messaging (SMS). In order for carriers to keep up with the explosive growth of smartphones and their increased network consumption they are in need of any possible tool to assist them in managing their network and maintaining relevance on the users’ device.
 
We offer operators a mobile VoIP call that has ten (10) times less bandwidth than a standard telephone call over GSM or legacy mobile VoIP solutions such as Session Initiation Protocol (“SIP”). This gives operators a higher quality call on busy and legacy networks such as 2G, 3G and congested metro-based 4G using less bandwidth; meaning more bang for their “spectrum buck”. We will not replace traditional calls nor prevent the delivery of newer call types such as Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”) etc., but we give operators yet another tool in their arsenal to deliver the best quality voice, for the best value, for their diversified customer bases.

Our Technology
 
Our Technology
 
We have a very detailed knowledge of these wireless data network issues and have invented a totally new solution to successfully deliver a high quality voice call over a wireless Internet connection. Our solution is designed specifically to address such issues as call latency (i.e. delay) and network jitter (i.e. lost data) in a way that achieves a much higher likelihood of a voice packet (i.e. tiny piece of recorded voice) arriving in time and not being lost or delayed. Our awareness of these problems led us to develop a completely new algorithm for sending and receiving (and ordering) voice packets so as to reduce the likelihood of packet loss due to congestion, which we call SmartPacket™; and to the end user this just means near HD audio at a fraction of the cellular consumption.

SmartPacket™ Technology
 
The core of the Horizon solution is our truly innovative, and patented, SmartPacket™ technology. This enables VoIP from only 2 kilobytes/second (kbps) compared to around 8kbps and upwards from other VoIP platforms available today. This industry-leading solution has been developed in-house and is fully compatible with digital telecommunications standards. This technology is capable of interconnecting any phone system over IP - on mobile, fixed and satellite networks. Our SmartPacket™ technology is not based on legacy SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) or RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol). Rather, the Horizon signaling protocol is much simpler and benchmark testing has shown that it consumes significantly less bandwidth for the same audio quality score. Our SmartPacket™ technology is the world’s most bandwidth efficient IP communication platform designed for mobile communications. The technology optimizes voice flow, delivery and playback and delivers excellent call quality, reduced delays and drops. As a further illustration, the technology is considerably more efficient in the way it handles silence. Traditional VoIP calls send the same amount of data in both directions, regardless of whether or not someone is speaking. SmartPacket™ technology is designed to detect silence and send tiny “indications of silence”, rather than the silence itself. This massively reduces the amount of data transmitted, lowers the load on the cellular infrastructure which, in turn, means that more data can get through. This results in higher audio quality and a better user experience.
 
Our Benchmark Testing: Horizon vs the biggest smartphone VoIP technologies in the world
 
University published testing has shown that Horizon is up to 8.8 times more efficient, depending on which one of our voice compression settings is selected by the user. 
 

Proprietary Technology
 
The Horizon Platform has been developed entirely in-house, patented, and is fully compatible with digital telecommunications standards. It is capable of interconnecting any phone system over IP – on mobile, fixed and satellite networks.
 
The Horizon Platform was initially developed for the burgeoning smartphone market and the challenging mobile VoIP over satellite market by Abbey Technology to make the best use of the limited wireless bandwidth available and to minimize the amount of data consumed.
 
We further developed the Horizon Platform for the broader telecommunications market on Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android and a Windows PC client focusing on the mobile Internet sector. This sector also benefits from our optimized mobile VoIP as it allows voice calls over new and legacy cellular telecom data networks. With the explosive growth in smartphone sales and increased usage of mobile data services, mobile operators face the challenge of dealing with increasingly congested networks, more dropped calls and rising levels of churn. Since the wireless spectrum is a finite resource, it is not always possible, or can be cost prohibitive, to increase network capacity. For these reasons, we believe that the demand for solutions to optimize the use of IP bandwidth will inevitably increase.

Our Strategy
 
We have developed a mobile application template called “Horizon Call,” that enables highly bandwidth-efficient VoIP calls over a smartphone using a 2G/EDGE, 3G, 4G/LTE, WiFi or Satellite connection. Our Horizon Call application is currently available for the iPhone and for Android handsets and we use it to showcase all of our functions, features, our call quality and the level of software innovation that we can brand for our potential clients.
 
Unlike the majority of mobile VoIP applications, Horizon Call creates a white-label business-to-business solution for mobile operators. Telecommunications operators are able to license from us, brand with us and deploy with us a completely new “white-labeled” solution so that they can optimize their highly pressurized mobile internet bandwidth and deliver innovation that in turn brings them new smartphone users. The operators decide how to integrate our application within their portfolio, how to offer it commercially and can customize it according to their own branding.  Our solution helps them to manage increased traffic volumes while combating the competitive threat to their voice telephony revenues from other mobile VoIP applications by giving its mobile data customers a more efficient mobile VoIP solution that adds value to their mobile data network.
 
We are positioning ourselves as an operator-enabler by licensing our technology to mobile operators in a manner that can be fully customized to the needs of their subscribers. As shown below, operators are able to offer our platform to deliver branded smartphone applications to their existing customers to reduce lost Voice/Text revenue and minimize customer churn.

By offering Horizon Call to their existing customer base, our customers can offer innovative data-based voice and data services that are different from the existing Over The Top (“OTT”) data applications running on their networks. OTT refers to voice and messaging services that are delivered by a third party to an end user’s smartphone, leaving the mobile network provider responsible only for transporting internet data packets and not the value-added content. The Horizon Call voice services allow mobile operators’ customers to make VoIP calls under mobile operators’ call plans, thereby allowing mobile operators to capture value-added content, including voice calls, text messaging, voice messaging, group messaging, multimedia messaging, and advertising, that would have otherwise gone to the providers of other OTT services.
 
Horizon Call runs on both smartphone and tablet devices and, as networks become more congested, software services such as Horizon Call become ever more relevant. We believe that although more network capacity will eventually come on stream with 4G/LTE, it, like all other highways, will quickly become congested and this is why we believe that Horizon Call is ideally placed to add value to mobile data networks.
 
Incumbent mobile operators are suffering a reduction in revenue per user due to the OTT software services on mobile devices. OTT applications, such as Skype and Line, can negatively impact mobile operators’ traditional revenue streams of voice and SMS (short message service). As shown below, the Horizon Platform positions the Company to enable mobile operators to operate their own OTT solution branded in their image allowing use on all mobile data networks.
 

15

In addition to delivering new data services to their existing customers, mobile operators can offer their brand of Horizon Call on any other operators’ handsets. Because the Horizon Call application can be installed on the smartphone from the Internet, the potential customer base for the operators’ data application surpasses the customer base that they can reach through traditional mobile phone SIM card distribution. We believe that this service innovation, coupled with the fact that the Horizon Call application can also use existing mobile operator pre-paid credit redemption and distribution services, presents a very compelling service against OTT services.
 
We believe that emerging markets represent a key opportunity for Horizon Call because these are significant markets with high population densities, high penetration of mobile phones, congested mobile cellular networks and high growth in the adoption of smartphones. It is forecast that over 2.7 billion people will use smartphones in 2019. Asia-Pacific will account for over half of all smartphone users in 2016, estimated at 1.1 billion users. Globally, China is the largest smartphone market with an estimated 563.1 million handsets. These factors will put increased pressure on mobile operators to manage their network availability.
 
In this context, where necessary, we have created our own brand in China, called Aishuo, formed a number of strategic ventures with local partners in regions of various emerging markets to seize upon this opportunity.

Marketing
 
Our marketing objective is to become a broadly adopted solution in the regions of the world with large concentrations of smartphone users and high network congestion. We aim at becoming the preferred solution for carriers who wish to deploy branded VoIP solutions that enable them to minimize revenue erosion, reduce churn, increase the effective capacity of their network infrastructure and improve user experience. We employ an integrated multi-channel approach to marketing, whereby we evaluate and focus our efforts on selling through telecommunications companies to enable them to provide the Horizon Platform to their customers. We routinely evaluate our marketing efforts and try to reallocate budgets to identify more effective media mixes.
 
We conduct marketing research to gain consumer insights into brand, product, and service performance, and utilize those findings to improve our messaging and media plans. Market research is also leveraged in the areas of testing, retention marketing, and product marketing to ensure that we bring compelling products and services to market.
 
Sales
 
Direct Sales. Our primary sales channel for the products and services of Horizon Platform is the sale of Horizon Platforms to Tier 1 and Tier 2 telecommunications companies to enable them to provide the product and services to their customers. We continue our efforts to develop new customers globally but particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Strategic Ventures. In addition to our direct sales channel, we also offer increased sales through our strategic venture channel. In this context, as mentioned above, we are working towards forming a number of strategic ventures in areas where regulatory issues require local representation.
Target Markets. The markets for our primary and joint venture channels will have high population density, high penetration of mobile phones, congested mobile cellular networks and high growth in the adoption of smartphones.
Competition
 
Our direct competitors for its technology primarily consist of systems integrators that combine various elements of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialers and media gateways. Other dial-back solutions exist but they are not IP-based. Because SIP dialers and media gateways currently are unable to provide a low bandwidth solution, they do not currently compete with the Company’s technology in those markets in which their high bandwidth needs are unsupported by the existing cellular networks. They do, however, compete in those markets where the cellular networks are accessible by those SIP dialers and gateways.
 
We license the Horizon Platform to mobile operators, who in turn may offer the application to their end-user subscribers. The Company’s principal competitors for the mobile operators’ end-users are Skype, Viber, WeChat, and WhatsApp. Having a mobile operator’s subscriber opt to use the operator’s (branded) Horizon Call service instead of existing OTT services means that the mobile operator will gain market share of some of the OTT voice and messaging traffic. We are currently unaware of any other companies that seek to license VoIP technology directly to mobile operators.

One of our key competitive advantages is that we are not a threat to mobile operators. Rather, the Company’s Horizon Platform is a tool that can be used by mobile operators to compete against the OTT provider’s applications that are running on their networks. Through the Horizon Platform, mobile operators are able to compete directly with OTT services that, by their design, divert voice and messaging services away from mobile operators. The solution is delivered completely and is easy to install and operate. This means that a mobile operator has a turnkey mobile voice and messaging solution to deploy to its customer (i.e., the end-user).
 
The turnkey Horizon software platform and the Horizon SmartPacket™ technology give us a competitive advantage by managing credit, routing, rating, security, performance, billing and monitoring. Horizon SmartPacket™ is the world’s lowest bandwidth voice compression and transmission protocol and is 100% developed and owned by the Company. Though other software companies can offer part of this solution space, we believe none offers it in such a complete and integrated fashion as we do. We believe it will take a substantial number of years to copy/replicate the Horizon Platform in its entirety, by which time we believe the Horizon Platform will have improved and further distanced itself from potential competition.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our strategy with respect to our intellectual property is to patent our core software concepts wherever possible. The Company’s current software patent has been approved in the United States and is pending in other jurisdictions around the world. Our patent strategy serves to protects the Horizon Platform and the central processing service of the Horizon Platform.
 
The Company endeavors to protect its internally developed systems and technologies. All of our software is developed “in-house,” and then licensed to our customers. We take steps, including by contracts, to ensure that any changes, modifications or additions to the Horizon Platform requested by our customers remain the sole intellectual property of the Company.
 
Research and Development and Software Products
 
We have spent approximately $0.5 million on capitalizable research and development during 2016.
 
Throughout 2016 we continued with our focus on innovation and our research and development teams (“R&D”) brought us software that allows our customer to offer call and messaging Bundles. This is a common feature for SIM cards and popular with mobile subscribers whereby the user pre-purchases bulk minutes at a lower per minute rate that when they pay for a call minute by minute. The Company now offers such innovations to its subscribers right inside the operators’ smartphone app supplied to Company thereby driving up the operator’s revenue per user.
 
We also expanded our R&D effort into the cellular operators' core network with a feature set that allows our service to directly connect to an operators Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) service thereby allowing all mobile prepaid subscribers to add credit to their mobile account in a traditional way and then allowing this USSD top up to be applied to a mobile VoIP smartphone app, an industry first.
 
The Cyber-Security R&D team also delivered a cyber-secure VoIP service that leverages the low bandwidth benefits of Company’s patented technology to allow VoIP over the strongest security protocols on the Internet. By leveraging the power of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) native client on the smartphone the Company’s VoIP protocols work where other traditional VoIP solutions cannot due to call quality issues with high data consumption protocols. Management expect this platform to drive a new revenue stream for Cyber Secure VoIP.
 
Also in 2016 our Cyber-Security R&D team delivered a stand alone version of our optimized VoIP core network server software for vertical markets covering Government, Banks and Small to Medium Enterprises that ensures privacy of their internal voice and messaging services in a cryptographically secure way. Our stand alone service can be installed on-site at the customer and requires minimal operational support thereby delivering secure communications in a cost efficient manner.

R&D also delivered a standalone Lawful Intercept module for operators that are legally required to have call recording features. This service is capable of recording calls from VoIP application on the handset to another handset or to the traditional telephone network. Such features are required by regulators in certain jurisdictions around the world.  This feature also allows our mobile solution to internet connect with Microsoft's Skype for Business Unified Communication platform.
 
R&D also delivered a complete mobile app telephone conferencing service where a user of our VoIP service can bring in other parties to an on-going call, an ad-hoc conference. This feature is targeting the B2B user that may need multi-party calls on lower quality or congested mobile data networks.
 
R&D delivered a complete integration into one of Africa's largest micropayments platforms, Ecocash.  App users can now securely pay for their calls from inside the app using this widely used payment solution.
 
Cyber-Security team delivered a completely new security messaging solution with external key-broker for the ultimate in message security.  Using our solution, not even the service-host can decrypt the app-app messages as the keys are not available inside the core network.  Our distributed key broker can be located anywhere in the world, independent of the service-host passing messages thereby guaranteeing message security for the end to end communication.
 
R&D delivered a bespoke real-time network quality monitor that automatically adjusts the bandwidth consumed by a handset for a VoIP call depending out network strength.  This allow for a much smoother call with reduced jitter and enhanced user acceptance.
 
R&D commenced the development work on iOS for the latest Apple CallKit service.
 
Cyber-Security R&D team commenced development on an encrypted call solution that can avail of the independent key broker service for the ultimate in VoIP security.
