ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the health and well-being of patients affected by metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and obesity. We are focused on developing novel therapeutics that treat the underlying biological mechanisms through the methionine aminopeptidase 2, or MetAP2, pathway. We have pioneered the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare forms of obesity. Our lead product candidate is ZGN-1061, a novel fumagillin-class MetAP2 inhibitor administered by subcutaneous injection, which is currently being profiled for its utility in the treatment of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and obesity. We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in the Netherlands, and have completed dosing patients in the single ascending dose, or SAD, portion and are currently dosing patients in the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion. This clinical trial is evaluating ZGN-1061 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics while also gaining an early indication of weight loss efficacy over four weeks of treatment. We currently expect to complete dosing the patients in this Phase 1 clinical trial by the end of the first quarter of 2017, and report results early in the second quarter of 2017. 
 On July 19, 2016, we announced that we were refocusing our resources on the development of ZGN-1061 and suspended further development of beloranib, a first generation MetAP2 inhibitor, that we had been developing as a treatment for obesity and hyperphagia in Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, and for hypothalamic injury-associated obesity, or HIAO. The Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for beloranib was placed on full clinical hold in December 2015 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a result of an imbalance in the number of thrombotic events observed in patients treated with beloranib as compared to patients on placebo in our clinical trials. To address the full clinical hold, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA in June 2016 to discuss the clinical and pre-clinical data for beloranib, as well as a proposed risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS. Following our discussions with the FDA, a comprehensive review of our assets and clinical programs, and review of other considerations, we determined that the obstacles, costs and development timelines to obtain marketing approval for beloranib were too great to justify additional investment in the program, particularly given the promising emerging profile of ZGN-1061. In addition, in January 2016, we withdrew the IND submitted to the FDA for ZGN-839, a liver targeted MetAP2 inhibitor for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and abdominal obesity, in order to further support the submission package with additional pre-clinical and clinical data requested by the FDA, and in October 2016, we suspended further development of ZGN-839. We are now focusing all of our personnel and financial resources on ZGN-1061 and the discovery of highly differentiated MetAP2 inhibitors. 
 Obesity is a complex medical disorder involving appetite dysregulation and altered lipid and energy metabolism that results in excessive accumulation of fat tissue. ZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control. 
 ZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting pre-clinical safety concerns observed with beloranib, including teratogenicity and effects on testicular function. To date, the compound has similar efficacy, potency, and range of activity in animal models

 of obesity as beloranib, but displays highly differentiated properties and improved safety margins in pre-clinical studies, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized MetAP2 inhibitor. Further, the compound displays improved safety margins relative to beloranib for effects on thrombosis in dogs, an effect that correlates with reduced impact on endothelial cell proliferation in vitro.

 Populations of Interest 
 Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases 
 Obesity is a disease that has been increasing at an alarming rate with significant medical repercussions and associated economic costs. Since 1980, the worldwide obesity rate has more than doubled, with about 13% of the worlds adult population now being obese. The World Health Organization, or WHO, currently estimates that as many as 600 million people worldwide are estimated to be obese and more than 1.9 billion adults are estimated to be overweight. Being overweight or obese is also the fifth leading risk for global deaths, with approximately 3.4 million adults dying each year as a result. 
 According to the WHO, there are over 70 progressive obesity-related diseases and disorders associated with obesity, which are also known as comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, infertility and certain cancers. Worldwide, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to being overweight and obese. 
 We believe that this epidemic will continue to grow worldwide given dietary trends in developed nations that favor highly processed sugars, larger meals and fattier foods, as well as increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Despite the growing obesity rate, increasing public interest in the obesity epidemic and significant medical repercussions and economic costs associated with obesity, there continues to be a significant unmet need for effective treatments.

Obesity in the General Population 
 We are focusing the clinical development of ZGN-1061 as a treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes who also are obese. We believe this patient population would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through the improvement of type 2 diabetes and reduction of body weight and through improvement of severity or symptoms of other co-morbid conditions. We believe that MetAP2 inhibitors have the potential to offer this patient population, most of which is not adequately responsive to available therapies, substantial health and quality of life benefits. This patient population represents a significant burden to the health care systems globally. 
 The most effective current treatment for severe obesity is bariatric surgery, including procedures such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion. Bariatric surgery produces dramatic and sustained weight loss, ranging on average from 20% to 35% one year post-procedure and has been shown to positively impact overall mortality. However, there is a range of challenges that exist with bariatric surgery. In the short-term (1-2 years post-operation), it can result in numerous complications and adverse events including thrombotic events, such as pulmonary embolism, infection, internal bleeding, pulmonary disease and gastrointestinal obstruction, which sometimes require reoperation during the post-operative period. Over the long-term (up to 5 years post-operation), challenges of bariatric surgery include poor nutrient absorption, strictures and hernias. 
 A percentage of patients who undergo bariatric surgery may also experience the challenges of minimal weight loss and /or the regain of weight that has been lost. Additionally, while in the majority of cases, type 2 diabetes can be resolved in patients who receive bariatric surgery  there is a subset of patients who will continue to require management of their disease. For these patients who have failed bariatric surgery, and over time that group could expand to 30%-50% of patients who have the surgery  there may be no additional treatment options left for them to utilize. 
 Bariatric surgery eligibility criteria generally identify surgical candidates as those patients with body mass index, or BMIs, greater than 40 kg/m2, or those with BMIs over 35 kg/m2 who also have a significant and uncontrolled co-morbid condition. Based on these criteria, it is estimated conservatively that there will be at least 16 million adults in the United States eligible for bariatric surgery by the time a MetAP2 inhibitor could become available commercially. In addition to the BMI and co-morbidity eligibility criteria, patients need to satisfy a number of other criteria in order to have bariatric surgery; a severely obese patient must not have any known endocrine causes of obesity, a drug or alcohol problem, or an uncontrolled psychological condition, and must understand and appreciate the risks of the surgical intervention. According to the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery and to HealthGrades, the average cost of bariatric surgery in the United States is approximately $22,000-$38,000. As a result of these limiting criteria and the financial commitments required, only approximately 200,000 patients undergo bariatric surgery each year even though over 16 million patients in the United States are eligible for the surgery based on BMI alone. 
 The pharmaceutical industry has undertaken several waves of activity to discover and develop new drugs for the treatment of obesity. Relative to bariatric surgery, pharmaceutical treatments have produced modest efficacy. In addition, existing pharmacotherapeutics for obesity often have undesirable adverse event profiles.

 Type 2 Diabetes 
 According to the International Diabetes Federation, in 2013, 382 million people worldwide were living with type 2 diabetes and that number is projected to increase to 592 million by 2035. In the United States alone, the Center for Disease Control estimated that there were 26 million people living with type 2 diabetes and an estimated 79 million people who were pre-diabetic in 2011. Standard therapies for type 2 diabetes include physician recommended diet and exercise, oral hypoglycemic drugs such as biguanides (metformin) for type 2 diabetes, through to a number of insulin options. Metformin is first line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily due to the extensive experience, low cost and favorable benefit risk associated with it. While metformin is likely to remain the initial choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, ZGN-1061 will compete with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazoladinediones, insulin, and various combination products. It is estimated that therapeutics have attained an 80% penetration rate into the diagnosed group of patients. The objective of each is to maintain a daily blood glucose level range recommended by a physician. Each of the current therapies alone has its limitations including numerous side effects. These side effects and the availability of a high number of treatment options, combined with the difficulty in daily management of glucose levels despite these treatments, creates a number of opportunities for a new agent to positively impact unmet medical need. 
 According to DR/Decision Resources, LLC, the diabetes drug market is estimated to be $35 billion and is on pace to grow to more than $71 billion by 2024. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigating new approaches to treating diabetes and market value has been maintained in the industry due to the introduction of 
 
7 
 
 these new products. We believe that ZGN-1061 MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control.

 Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to be a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to significantly improve the health and well-being of patients affected by type 2 diabetes, obesity, and complex metabolic disorders. Key elements of our strategy include: 

 | Advance the clinical development of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of obese patients in the general population, including those who are candidates for bariatric surgery. We believe the obese patient population would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through the reduction of body weight and through improvement of other co-morbid conditions. Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss, but the financial expense and the potential for complications, adverse events and longer-term side effects limit its overall adoption, and is limited in use, with approximately 200,000 patients in the United States undergoing bariatric surgery each year. Existing pharmacotherapies result in less weight loss than surgical options, and these therapies not only have undesirable side effects, but also have risk of abuse.

 | Advance the clinical development of MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We believe the patient population of type 2 diabetes would benefit from MetAP2 inhibitor treatment through concomitant improvements in glycemic control, plasma lipid fractions, and body weight. These benefits were noted in our Phase 2b clinical trial ZAF-203, which studied the MetAP2 inhibitor beloranib in patients with both type 2 diabetes and obesity.

 | Leverage the knowledge of our experienced team of drug developers that have deep expertise in the field of obesity, the function of MetAP2 inhibitors and metabolic diseases. Our management team has deep expertise in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related metabolic diseases, the function of MetAP2 inhibitors, the strengths and weaknesses of current treatments for type 2 diabetes and obesity and the

ability to recognize the potential of novel therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our team is complemented by highly experienced external consultants and collaborators in the areas of drug discovery, development and regulatory approval.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintain flexibility in commercializing and maximizing the value of our earlier-stage research programs. While we intend to develop and commercialize ZGN-1061 for indications such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and other complex metabolic disorders, we may enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to realize the full value of ZGN-1061 or our other earlier-stage research programs. For ZGN-1061, we may enter into one or more strategic relationships to access broader geographic markets or additional indications. These relationships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales of ZGN-1061.

 About ZGN-1061
ZGN-1061 acts through potent inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of key cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress and growth factor mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body stores and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, these processes lead to improvement of glycemic control. 
 ZGN-1061 was discovered by our researchers as part of a multi-year campaign to identify novel compounds that avoided limiting pre-clinical safety concerns observed with beloranib, including effects on testicular function. The compound has similar efficacy, potency, and range of desired pharmacological activities in animal models as other MetAP2 inhibitors, including beloranib. ZGN-1061 displays improved safety margins in pre-clinical studies relative to earlier MetAP2 inhibitors, supporting the value of the compound as a more highly optimized drug product candidate. 
 During pre-clinical development of ZGN-1061, we conducted research to understand the imbalance of thrombotic events observed in the course of beloranib clinical development. This research identified biomarkers associated with activation of blood clotting that subsequently were confirmed to be impacted in the setting of beloranib treatment in animals and cultured human endothelial cells. Before committing ZGN-1061 to clinical development, the compound was evaluated for its potential to augment blood clotting in these same models and was found to have a much larger margin of safety with respect to thrombosis. 
 Mechanism of Action 
 First-generation MetAP2 inhibitors, such as beloranib, were evaluated for their potential for treating obesity following publication of studies in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 showing anti-obesity efficacy in animals treated with a prototype MetAP2 inhibitor. These studies showed that MetAP2 inhibitor treatment was associated with loss of fat tissue accompanied by an increase in fat oxidation, indicating a redirection of fuel usage toward utilization of stored fats as a source of energy. Reduced food intake also was observed in treated animals, suggesting either direct effects of the agent on central feeding regulation or activation of a feedback loop linking the release and oxidation of stored fat to appetite. 
 The MetAP2 inhibitor fumagillin was shown in 2004 to induce a novel protein-protein interaction involving MetAP2 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1, or ERK1, a cell stress- and growth factor-stimulated kinase. This complex reduces the activation state of ERK1. A 2005 publication in Diabetes showed that animals lacking ERK1 resist both high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, supporting the hypothesis that attenuation of ERK activity could be an important component of the beneficial metabolic effects of MetAP2 inhibitor treatment. Additionally, several hormones well-documented to be involved in energy metabolism are affected by 
 
10 
 
 MetAP2 inhibitors, including leptin, adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor-21. These hormones are thought to contribute to the weight-reducing effects of MetAP2 inhibitors like ZGN-1061, and also are known to be involved in control of body weight, fat metabolism and glucose metabolism. This series of mechanistic effects leads to rapid and sustained reduction of excess body weight with ZGN-1061 treatment, such as has been observed in animal studies and our clinical trial experience to date.

 Clinical Trials 
 Below is a summary of the Phase 1 clinical trial that is ongoing with ZGN-1061 as of the date of this Annual Report. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 The ongoing ZGN-1061 Phase 1 clinical trial, ZAF-1061-101, is a randomized, double-blind (subject, principal investigator (PI), and site staff), placebo-controlled study consisting of a single ascending dose, or SAD, phase and a multiple ascending dose, or MAD, phase being conducted in the Netherlands. The SAD phase is designed to assess effects of ZGN-1061 at six ascending dose levels relative to placebo in male or female healthy volunteers with a BMI of 23 to <30 kg/m2 (normal weight or overweight individuals). The MAD phase assesses effects of twice-weekly subcutaneous injections (eight doses in total) of ZGN-1061 over four weeks at three ascending dose levels relative to placebo, in male or female healthy volunteers with BMI 27-40 kg/m2 (overweight or obese individuals). In addition to conventional safety and PK assessments, exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints are also assessed. These measures are intended to provide a preliminary assessment of the potential of ZGN-1061 for weight management and inform Phase 2 clinical trial design. 
 Next Steps 
 We plan to submit an IND to the FDA after completion of our Phase 1 ZAF-1061-101 clinical trial, in support of a clinical trial to be conducted in the United States. With positive data from the ZAF-1061-101 clinical trial we also plan to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial in Australia in obese patients with a subset of patients also having type 2 diabetes. 
 Pre-clinical
We have conducted toxicology studies of ZGN-1061 in support of clinical development. Based on the pre-clinical assessment, ZGN-1061 is not genotoxic. Dose selection and precautions for our ongoing Phase 1 
 
11 
 
 clinical trial have been informed by toxicology studies in rats, beagle dogs, and rabbits. Toxicological studies of up to one month in rats and dogs using single, daily or intermittent dosing have established no observed adverse effect levels at higher exposures relative to the anticipated human doses. At higher doses, the findings of toxicological importance were primarily injection site reactions in rats at high doses, as well as platelet reductions with bone marrow hypocellularity and morbidity at higher doses in dogs. Three month studies in the rat and dog are in-progress and will be complete prior to the start of the Phase 2 clinical trial program. Embryofetal toxicity studies in rats and rabbits are ongoing to determine the potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are, or might become, pregnant. 
Future Product Candidates 
 We are currently evaluating other second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors as potential development candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, NASH and other metabolic disorders. These studies involve screening compounds with insights learned in our thrombosis investigations and also looking at whether our second generation compounds could be amenable to non-injectable routes of delivery. We anticipate nominating one or more of these candidates for future development. 
 For information regarding amounts spent during each of the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research and development activities, see Part II Item 6Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 ZGN-1061 is a small molecule drug that is chemically synthesized from raw materials. The current process to produce ZGN-1061 for Phase 1 clinical trials involves synthesis of drug substance, and just-in-time formulation and production of sterile liquid drug product which can be stored frozen if needed. We are currently developing a lyophilized dosage form with longer shelf life for Phase 2 clinical trials. This drug product will include a sterile lyophilized vial and a pre-filled diluent syringe for reconstitution. The Phase 2 drug product is currently being manufactured at our drug product contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. The manufacturing processes for both drug substance and drug product are under active development and optimization and are not yet validated for commercialization. We control our clinical trial supply chain by periodically meeting to assess clinical trial material needs and status of supply. The clinical supply forecast is managed internally by a cross functional working group and is used to aid in decision making for current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, manufacturing as well as clinical kit packaging and labeling. 
 We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. Any delays encountered with manufacturing activities, CMO scheduling or raw material supply could delay the manufacturing of finished drug product. No long-term supply agreements are in place with our contractors, and each batch is individually contracted under a work order, which is governed by a quality agreement. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of ZGN-1061, if approved. Our current scale of manufacturing is adequate to support all of our current needs for clinical trial supplies. For commercial quantities for larger populations, we will need to identify contract manufacturers or partners to produce ZGN-1061 on a larger scale. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Based on our early stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure to launch ZGN-1061, we may either do so on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical or other biotechnology company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs and our available resources.

Licenses 
 CKD License 
 In July 2009, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. of South Korea, or CKD, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed beloranib from CKD on a worldwide basis, with the exception of South Korea. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee to CKD, paid a one-time fee following initiation of a proof of concept trial, agreed to make milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $7.5 million has been paid, including $3.3 million that was paid in the form of our common stock (valued at $3.6 million) as a result of an amendment to our license agreement and entry into a subscription agreement with CKD) to CKD upon the achievement of certain specified events, and agreed to pay a portion of sublicensing income to CKD. Furthermore, if we receive marketing approval for beloranib, we will pay single-digit royalties to CKD based on annual net sales of beloranib on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the CKD patent rights containing a valid claim covering beloranib or its use for which regulatory approval has been obtained in such country, or (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of beloranib in such country. Pursuant to this agreement, we committed to using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize beloranib. This agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until royalties are no longer due in such country, subject to earlier termination by either party upon mutual consent, or in the event of uncured breach or insolvency on the part of the other party, or by us for any reason up to 60 days prior notice. We are no longer developing beloranib as a treatment for humans. 
Childrens License 
 In January 2007, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Childrens Medical Center Corporation, or Childrens, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patent rights from Childrens on a worldwide basis. The licensed patent rights relate to decreasing the growth of fat tissue, and thereby cover the use of ZGN-1061 and related molecules as anti-obesity agents. In consideration of such exclusive license, we paid an initial license fee upon execution of the license to Childrens and annual maintenance fees through the fifth anniversary of the date of the license. We also agreed to make milestone payments to Childrens of up to $2.7 million (of which $0.4 million has been paid) with respect to the first licensed product and up to $1.3 million with respect to each subsequent licensed product, if any, that is a new chemical entity upon the achievement of certain specified events and to pay a portion of sublicensing income to Childrens. If we receive marketing approval for ZGN-1061, we will pay single-digit royalties to Childrens based on net sales of ZGN-1061 until the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent in such country within the licensed patents containing a valid claim covering ZGN-1061 or (ii) 15 years from the date of the agreement. This agreement will remain in effect for the longer of (i) 15 years and (ii) the life of the last expiring licensed patent, subject to earlier termination (x) by Childrens in the event of our insolvency or our failure to cure a breach within 60 days (30 days in the case of non-payment) of receiving written notice thereof, or (y) by us for any reason upon 120 days prior written notice. We are no longer developing beloranib as a treatment for humans. 
Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and 
 
13 
 
 enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of ZGN-1061 and our other development programs. 
 As of March 1, 2017, we own one pending U.S. patent application, one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application, and two pending U.S. provisional patent applications that relate to ZGN-1061.
As of March 1, 2017, we own 12 issued U.S. patents, and 14 pending U.S. patent applications with pending foreign counterpart applications, all of which relate to our internal efforts to discover novel MetAP2 inhibitors. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents will expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2032. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country to country basis for each applicable product and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 As a result of the America Invents Act of 2011, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in March 2013, under which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. This will require us to minimize the time from invention to the filing of a patent application. 
 
14 
 
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Intellectual Property. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. PTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 In addition, substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in third parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published only after 18 months from the priority date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to drugs similar to ZGN-1061 and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. These competitors may develop and introduce products and processes comparable or superior to ours. 
Obesity 
 Surgical Approaches 
 Surgical approaches to treat obesity are becoming increasingly accepted and are believed to be the main form of competition to ZGN-1061 in this indication. Bariatric surgery eligibility criteria generally identify surgical candidates as those patients with BMIs greater than 40 kg/m2, or those with BMIs over 35 kg/m2 who also have a significant and uncontrolled co-morbid condition. Other potential competitors in the obesity market include bariatric service providers, and other potential approaches which utilize various implantable devices or surgical tools that have been approved by the FDA, such as EnteroMedics Inc.s recently FDA-approved (January 2015) VBlock Therapy, or that are in development by companies such as Allergan, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd., EnteroMedics, Inc., GI Dynamics, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. 
 
15 
 
Existing Obesity Drugs 
 In addition, ZGN-1061 may compete with orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, bupropion/naltrexone and liraglutide, which are approved and currently marketed pharmaceutical products in the United States for the treatment of obesity. Several additional agents are also available in the United States (phentermine, phendimetrazine, benzphetamine and diethylpropion) however they are only indicated for short-term (a few weeks) administration. Overall, the available products are constrained in their ability to effectively treat patients with obesity either because of limitations in efficacy or because of safety restrictions. 
 Despite the large market opportunity for anti-obesity agents, there are relatively few competitive products in late-stage clinical development. There are a number of other pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device companies that are pursuing treatments for obesity. 
 Existing Type 2 Diabetes Drugs 
 Biguanides (metformin) is first line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily due to the extensive experience, low cost and favorable benefit risk associated with it. While metformin is likely to remain the initial choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, ZGN-1061 will compete with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazoladinediones, insulin, and various combination products. Although these pharmacotherapies are all effective to some extent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, they each have notable limitations, and have not been found to halt the progression of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, additional effective and durable options are needed. 
 There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have type 2 diabetes drugs that are pursuing products with unique mechanisms of action for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as ZGN-1061. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
U.S. Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls, withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
16 
 
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | Completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the clinical trial to be suspended or terminated. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and 
 
17 
 
 rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA, although additional Phase 3 clinical trials may be required for certain indications. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and manufacturers, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

NDA and FDA Review Process 
 Following clinical trial completion, clinical trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain proof of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDAs fee schedule for fiscal year 2017, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2,038,100. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs of $97,750 and an annual establishment fee of $512,200 on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority new molecular-entity NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. In the case of obesity drugs, the FDA normally refers such drugs to the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements 
 
19 
 
 and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. 
 
20 
 
Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 A product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as: 
 

 | distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biological product may be eligible for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoint. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric Clinical Trials 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed into law on July 9, 2012, and amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the 
 
21 
 
 product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drugs approved labeling (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. 
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, voluntary recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers 
 
22 
 
 for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, minus any time the applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new 
 
23 
 
 chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a clinical trial. 
 European Union Drug Development 
 In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the clinical trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation will apply by October 2018. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European 
 
24 
 
 Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. 
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidate could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitors product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is intended to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expands and increases industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and makes changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any transfer of value made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to annually report this information to CMS which posts the information on its website. The new presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority, and has alternatively discussed repealing and replacing the ACA. We do not know at this time what implications such changes, if enacted, would have on the ACAs current requirements or on our future business. Changes to the ACA or other existing health care regulations could significantly impact our business and the pharmaceutical industry. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, 
 
26 
 
 including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 Employees
