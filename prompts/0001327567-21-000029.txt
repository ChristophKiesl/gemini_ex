ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Palo Alto Networks, Inc. is a global cybersecurity provider with a vision of a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before. We were incorporated in 2005 and are headquartered in Santa Clara, California.
We empower enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure all users, applications, data, networks, clouds and devices with comprehensive visibility and context continuously across all locations. We deliver cybersecurity products covering a broad range of use cases, enabling our end-customers to secure their networks, remote and hybrid workforces, branch locations, and public and private clouds, and to advance their Security Operations Centers (“SOC”). We believe our portfolio offers advanced prevention and security, while reducing the total cost of ownership for organizations by improving operational efficiency and eliminating the need for siloed point products. We do this with solutions focused on delivering value in five fundamental areas:
Zero Trust Network Security:
•Enabling zero trust network security through our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, available in a number of form factors, including physical, virtual, and containerized appliances, as well as a cloud-delivered service. This also includes our add-on Cloud-Delivered Security Services, such as Threat Prevention, WildFire, URL Filtering, Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security, IoT Security, GlobalProtect, SD-WAN, Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (“Enterprise DLP”), SaaS Security API and SaaS Security Inline that secure content, applications, users, and devices across our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, Prisma, and Cortex product lines, to enable best-in-class security across a broad range of applications. Panorama, our network security management solution, available as hardware or virtual machine, can centrally manage all of our firewalls irrespective of their form factor, location, or scale. 
Cloud Security:
•Enabling cloud security through our Prisma security offerings. Prisma Cloud, the industry’s most comprehensive Cloud Native Security Platform (“CNSP”), secures multi- and hybrid-cloud environments and cloud native applications, integrating security across the full deployment lifecycle. VM-Series and CN-Series enforce in-line network security in multi- and hybrid-cloud environments. 
Secure Access Service Edge:

Unit 42 offers incident response, risk management, board advisory and proactive cybersecurity assessment services.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
We are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in significant global, social, and business disruption. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, we did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2021. We are conducting business as usual with restrictions to employee travel, and we have transitioned in-person marketing events to virtual formats, among other modifications. We expect these changes will substantially remain in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and could extend to future quarters. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.
Although some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, COVID-19 
- 4 -


has affected our end-customers’ spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, impact on our end-customers’ spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing business, results of operations and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business,” “Risk Factors-Our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us,” and “Legal Proceedings” below for additional information.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive enterprise security industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the application, threat, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements for the protection from threats and the safe enablement of applications. Our main competitors fall into five categories:
•large companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) or those that have acquired, or may acquire, large network and endpoint security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;
•independent security vendors such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”), and Zscaler, Inc. (“Zscaler”) that offer a mix of network and endpoint security products;
•startups and single-vertical vendors that offer independent or emerging solutions across various areas of security;
•public cloud vendors and startups that offer solutions for cloud security (private, public and hybrid cloud); and
•large and small companies, such as Crowdstrike, Inc (“Crowdstrike”) that offer solutions for security operations and endpoint security.
As our market grows, it will attract more highly specialized vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product features, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
•product line breadth, diversity, and applicability;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our portfolio, the ease of integration of our products with technological infrastructures, and the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, more diversified product lines, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.

Distribution. We primarily sell our products and subscription and support offerings to end-customers through our channel partners utilizing a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and subscription and support offerings to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. Sales are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive distributor agreement, which provides for an initial term of one year, one-year renewal terms, termination by us with 30 to 90 days written notice prior to the renewal date, and payment to us from the channel partner within 30 to 45 calendar days of the date we issue an invoice for such sales. For fiscal 2021, 56.0% of our total revenue was derived from sales to three distributors.
We also sell our VM-Series virtual firewalls directly to end-customers through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace, and Google’s Cloud Platform Marketplace under a usage-based licensing model.
Sales. Our sales organization is responsible for large-account acquisition and overall market development, which includes the management of the relationships with our channel partners, working with our channel partners in winning and supporting end-customers through a direct-touch approach, and acting as the liaison between our end-customers and our marketing and product development organizations. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount to expand our reach in all key growth sectors.
Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end-customers, and technical training for our channel partners.
Channel Program. Our NextWave Channel Partner program is focused on building in-depth relationships with solutions-oriented distributors and resellers that have strong security expertise. The program rewards these partners based on a number of attainment goals, as well as provides them access to marketing funds, technical and sales training, and support. To promote optimal productivity, we operate a formal accreditation program for our channel partners’ sales and technical professionals. As of July 31, 2021, we had more than 5,900 channel partners.
Customer Support. Our customer support organization is responsible for delivering support, professional, and educational services directly to our channel partners and to end-customers. We leverage the capabilities of our channel partners and train them in the delivery of support, professional, and educational services to enable these services to be locally delivered. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven experience to provide those services.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and the market awareness of our portfolio and driving pipeline and end-customer demand. Our marketing team consists primarily of product marketing, brand, demand, field, communications, including analyst relations and digital and analytics functions. Marketing activities include pipeline development through demand generation, social media and advertising programs, managing the corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, analyst relationships, customer advocacy, and customer awareness. Every year we organize our end-customer conference “Ignite.” We also publish threat intelligence research such as the Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report and the Unit 42 IoT Threat Report, which are based on data from our global threat intelligence team, Unit 42. These activities and tools benefit both our direct and indirect channels and are available at no cost to our channel partners.
Backlog. Orders for subscription and support offerings for multiple years are generally billed upfront shortly after fulfillment and are included in deferred revenue. Timing of revenue recognition for subscription and support offerings may vary depending on the contractual period or when the subscription and support offerings are rendered. Products are shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. However, insufficient supply and inventory may delay our product shipments. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. As such, we do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful and it is not necessarily indicative of our future operating results.
Seasonality. Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. We have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business, which we expect to become more pronounced as we continue to grow, with our strongest sequential revenue growth occurring in our fiscal second and fourth quarters.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of our security products to various manufacturing partners, which include our electronics manufacturing services provider (“EMS provider”) and original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Our EMS provider is Flextronics International, Ltd. (“Flex”), who assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
The component parts within our products are either sourced by our manufacturing partners or by various component suppliers. We do not have any long-term manufacturing contracts that guarantee us any fixed capacity or pricing, which could increase our exposure to supply shortages or price fluctuations related to raw materials.

Human Capital
We believe our ongoing success depends on our employees. Development and investment in our people have always been central to who we are, and will continue to be so. Our People Strategy is a comprehensive approach to source, hire, onboard, integrate, develop, engage and reward employees. With a global workforce of 10,473 (as of July 31, 2021), we take our People Strategy seriously and manage it as a critical element of our overall company strategy.
Source & Hire. Sourcing and hiring diverse talent and setting them free to create and execute is central to our approach to our people. Our talent acquisition team utilizes a number of methods to find subject experts in their respective fields, including the use of a variety of channels that focus on reaching diverse and underserved communities. Our university relations team partners with hundreds of academic institutions, including colleges and universities that focus on serving underrepresented populations, to provide career pathways for early-in-career candidates. We also encourage current employees to provide qualified referrals. Through our License-to-Hire program, we ensure that hiring managers are trained to recruit, that they are made aware of potential unconscious biases and interview for the values and competencies that we believe enhance our culture. We have diverse interview panels to deliver a quality interview experience to a diverse slate of candidates.
Onboard & Integrate. We believe that a positive onboarding experience is foundational to positive employee engagement and rapid productivity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we built and utilized virtual learning platforms and employee communication channels to provide new employees with inspirational, often personalized, onboarding experiences. Onboarding is a journey of integration that extends through the first year at Palo Alto Networks for every employee. In addition, we have built specialist learning tracks for interns and new graduates that have been recognized as best in class externally. As part of our merger and acquisition strategy, we have also established a robust integration program with the goal to enable individuals joining our teams to feel part of our culture at speed.
Develop & Motivate. FLEXLearn is our unique approach to personalized employee development. FLEXLearn is a learning experience platform that provides employees with a path based on their needs, interests, style, and career journey. Development information about core business elements, professional skill sets, working in a distributed environment, as well as required compliance training, such as Code of Conduct, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-bribery training, is also deployed through the FLEXLearn platform. In addition, FLEXLearn provides employees with events and activities that motivate and spark critical thinking, on topics ranging from inclusion, to well-being and collaboration. As of July 31, 2021, 99.5% of our employees had completed Code of Conduct and Business Ethics training. On average, employees had completed 12 hours of development through the FLEXLearn platform during fiscal 2021.
Engage & Reward. We conduct weekly executive listening sessions and frequent “pulse surveys” to better understand employee engagement, sentiment well-being, and latterly, the agility to transition to a distributed work model. Many of these sessions have informed our holistic People Strategy through programs like FLEXWORK, Inclusion and Diversity, and Internal Mobility. 
Employee sentiment has continued to be highly positive. In February 2021, we conducted an anonymous global employee engagement survey. The response rate was 92% representing all functions and geographies. The overall engagement score was 81%. Employees indicated a strong sense of belonging, confidence in leadership, and an understanding of how their work contributes to the Company’s goals. Outcomes from the survey are being used to develop company-wide and function-specific action plans. 
In addition to a comprehensive compensation and diverse benefits program, we believe in an always-on feedback and rewards philosophy. From recurring 1:1 sessions and quarterly performance feedback to use of our Cheers for Peers peer recognition program, employees get continuous input about the value they bring to the organization.
Inclusion & Diversity. We are intentional about including diverse points of view, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and ideas in our decision-making processes. We deeply believe that true diversity exists when we have representation of all ethnicities, genders, orientations and identities, and cultures in our workforce. Our Inclusion and Diversity (“I&D”) programs continue to advance those visions. The diversity of our board of directors, with women representing 33% of our board (as of July 31, 2021), is an example of that vision in action. We have eight employee network groups (“ENG”s) which are employee-led groups that play a vital role in building understanding and awareness. Over 25% of our global workforce was involved in at least one ENG as of July 31, 2021. Our ENGs are provided with a budget to fund activities for their communities, we involve our ENGs in listening sessions with executive teams and we work in partnership to develop our annual I&D plans, because we believe involvement is critical. Our I&D philosophy is fully embedded in our talent acquisition, learning and development and rewards and recognition programs.
FLEXWORK. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, we have learned how to collaborate in a distributed work reality and to create opportunities for employees to maintain a sense of belonging and focus on well-being. The pivot to a distributed work model presented an opportunity to re-examine how and where we work going forward past the pandemic. Moving into the future we aim to disrupt the nature of work. Our philosophy is simple: place our employees at the center of their working life by providing employees flexibility, personalization, and choice regarding how they work, the benefits they choose, the way they consume learning and, where possible, where they work. We truly believe that the more our

employees have choice, the more engaged they will be. This theory has proven out in both the productivity and positive sentiment achieved across the months of the pandemic.
FLEXWORK adds even more opportunity to scale our efforts to improve Inclusion and Diversity. It further enables us to recognize each individual as unique, with their own priorities and needs, and gives the employee greater agency to personalize their decisions and utilize our programs and initiatives to meet those interests and desires.
The change to the nature of work won’t happen in isolation as other organizations must make similar transitions. We created the FLEXWORK Coalition, a group of over 800 companies that have joined discussion sessions about the nature of work. Our company leads these conversations, bringing in expert speakers and case studies to guide other company transformations. 
Environmental, Social & Governance
We recognize our duty to address environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. From our Climate Commitment and our social impact programs to our Supplier Responsibility initiatives and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we value the opportunity to have meaningful outcomes that reinforce our intention to respect our planet, uplift our communities and advance our industry.
Environmental. We recognize climate change is a global crisis and are committed to doing our part to reduce environmental impacts by setting clear goals, engaging in coalitions and collaborating across our value chain. In February 2021, we declared a set of climate commitments. Aligned to the Paris Agreement, we set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 and outlined three strategies to reach that goal: utilize 100% renewable energy, reduce our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions using guidance established by the Science Based Targets initiative and to offset remaining emissions by investing in quality carbon offset programs. We committed to being transparent about our progress over time through annual reporting. 
Social. In addition to our FLEXWORK People Strategy described in the section titled “Human Capital” above, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the deployment of our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, we continued to reach across our supply chain to communicate our expectations regarding labor standards, business practices and workplace health and safety conditions. During fiscal 2021, we became an affiliate member of the Responsible Business Alliance and published a Supplier Diversity statement to advance our supplier responsibility programs. We value our role as a good corporate citizen and scaled our social impact programs in fiscal 2021, focusing on helping colleagues and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through charitable donations, employee giving and volunteer programs. We also expanded our cybersecurity education programs to help youth protect their digital way of life and to prepare diverse adults for careers in cybersecurity.
Governance. Integrity is one of our core values. Our corporate behavior and leadership practices model ethical decision making. Employees and suppliers are informed about our governance expectations through our Codes of Conduct, compliance training programs and ongoing communications. As of July 31, 2021, 99.5% of our employees had completed Code of Conduct and Business Ethics training. Reinforcing the importance of our ESG performance, the charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the board of directors includes the primary oversight of ESG.
