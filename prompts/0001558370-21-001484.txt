ITEM 1.               BUSINESS.
Blue Apron's vision is "better living through better food." Founded in 2012, we are on a mission to spark discovery, connection and joy through cooking. We offer fresh, chef-designed recipes that empower our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference cooking quality food can make in their lives. 
Our core product is the meal experience we help our customers create. These experiences extend from discovering new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques to preparing meals with families and loved ones to sharing photos and stories of culinary triumphs. Central to these experiences are the original recipes we design with fresh, seasonally inspired produce and high quality ingredients sent directly to our customers. We also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals, and we sell a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, which are tested and recommended by our culinary team. Our customers span ages, geographies, income brackets, and levels of culinary expertise. They include young couples, families, singles, and empty nesters. Our passionate community of home cooks tell us, through emails, phone calls, and social media, how much Blue Apron has changed their lives.
Central to our operations, we have developed an integrated network that employs technology and expertise across many disciplines. Our supply-demand coordination activities––demand planning, recipe creation, procurement, recipe merchandising, fulfillment operations, distribution, customer service, and marketing––drive our end-to-end value chain. 
Our Business Strategy
In August 2019, Blue Apron introduced a new return-to-growth strategy, focused on our operations in the United States in the direct-to-consumer channel. Our growth strategy is centered on three main objectives: 

● | engage more consumers that have our best customer characteristics, consisting of households with couples and families as well as single-person homes and empty nesters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer greater menu choice and flexibility in our products and services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | scale our marketing efficiently.
--+---------------------------------

In 2020, while the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected economies, marketplaces, communities, and businesses, including ours, we prioritized our employees and customers and largely continued to execute against our strategic priorities. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19 on our Business” under Part II, Item 7 for further discussion.
Our Products
Meals
On our direct-to-consumer platform, we strive to offer our customers a balanced mix of ingredients, cuisines, familiarity, discovery, and preparation times. We are focused on offering a variety of choices every week, including a range of recipes designed for a healthy lifestyle, so that customers can make selections based on their individual or household needs and preferences. We currently offer three weekly meal plans: a Two-Serving Plan, a Four-Serving Plan, and Meal Prep Plan. Customers have the flexibility to choose any combination of the recipes offered in their selected plan each week. This includes any two, three or four two-serving recipes from eleven choices on the Two-Serving Plan; any two, three, or four four-serving recipes from seven choices on the Four-Serving Plan; and one of two choices on the Meal Prep Plan. The Meal Prep Plan provides eight servings consisting of two portions of four distinct recipes. Since the second half of 2020, customers are able to purchase a second box each week, allowing them to select up to eight 

7



different recipes per week at staggered times, double recipes to serve up to eight people per meal on the Four-Serving Plan, or balance out their cooking by getting a Meal Prep Plan for lunches and quick dinners alongside a box for more elevated and premium meals.
Based on the number of Orders in 2020 per plan type, approximately 79% of our meal orders were for the Two-Serving Plan, and approximately 21% were for the Four-Serving Plan. Our customers can tailor their orders to complement their individual tastes and lifestyles. Some customers prefer to let our recipe recommendation algorithm choose their recipes based on the food preferences they have provided to us, while other customers actively choose several weeks in advance of delivery which recipes to receive. Customers can choose to receive orders each week, or less frequently if that better suits their schedules. Customers can make their order selections on our website or through our mobile application.
Since the fourth quarter of 2020, customers have had the option to customize some of their recipe selections, such as the ability to upgrade a protein for a more premium protein, replace a meat with a plant protein, swap a vegetable for a starch, or increase the portion size by adding more protein or vegetables. We also began offering Premium recipes in 2020 that introduce our customers to specialty protein combinations, advanced culinary techniques, and unique flavor twists. Both our customized options and Premium recipes are priced at a premium to our standard rates. We also sell occasion-based offerings from time to time, which we have sold both on our subscription meal plan and the Blue Apron Market platform.
Our culinary team, including chefs who are alumni of some of the best restaurants in the world, such as Michelin-starred Per Se and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, begins the recipe creation process with various seasonally-inspired ingredients. Our chefs apply to these raw ingredients their expertise and insights from our customer feedback and recipe ratings to create our recipe offerings, with an eye towards what is delicious and accessible for individuals and families to eat week in and week out.
We merchandise our recipes through various campaigns geared toward seasonality, dietary preferences, ingredients, and healthy lifestyles. Our approach to menu design seeks to balance ingredient supply and cost while appealing to a variety of customer lifestyles and cooking attitudes across a broad range of demographics and taste profiles. 
We are committed to sourcing fresh produce and other high quality ingredients year-round from our supplier network that includes farmers, ranchers, fisheries, and artisans. Our recipes change every week based on the season and often feature specialty ingredients not readily available elsewhere. By merchandising these ingredients into carefully crafted recipes, we are able to introduce our customers to ingredients they may have never experienced before. We also collaborate with suppliers to create ingredients specifically for our recipes, such as custom sauces, unique spice blends, or, for example, bespoke ramen noodles from a third-generation noodle maker.
Our ingredient standards are critically important to us and our customers. We source only ingredients certified by our suppliers as non-GMO (genetically modified organism) and buy some ingredients from certified organic producers. All of our beef, poultry, and pork comes from animals given exclusively vegetarian feed and not treated with added hormones or sub-therapeutic antibiotics, and our eggs are Certified Humane Raised and Handled® pasture raised. Similarly, we source high-quality seafood consistent with the standards established by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, one of the world’s most respected sustainable seafood organizations, and we prioritize sourcing seafood with additional third-party verified sustainability certifications.
Wine
Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service, uses an integrated supply chain and direct sourcing relationships to deliver high-quality wines at compelling values. We work directly with vineyards and a number of acclaimed winemakers to create custom Blue Apron wines that are specially crafted for our customers and uniquely curated to pair with our meals. Our wines are sized for a dinner for two (in 500ml bottles, rather than traditional 750ml bottles). Customers have the flexibility to customize their box, choosing six bottles from a monthly selection of wines, that best meet their taste preferences. A pairing key system provides insight into the wine profiles, and enables 

8



customers to pair their Blue Apron meals and wines. Our wine offerings include curated red and white wines (and seasonally available rosé), tasting notes, pairing tips, and the story behind each wine. We are a licensed winery, and currently ship directly to customers in 31 states and Washington, D.C.
As with our meals, customers may choose to actively manage their monthly wine orders by adjusting deliveries to fit their schedules, or they may simply sign up and receive one or two deliveries each month. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, wine customers have also been able to order a second box per monthly cycle. In addition to our monthly wine service, customers have the ability to order curated assortments and wine by the bottle, half-case, case, or other bundles on the Blue Apron Market, outside of the monthly subscription model.
Market
Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce market, features a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, which are tested in our test kitchen and recommended by our culinary team. A number of these items are not available elsewhere, and we regularly evaluate expanding our exclusive items and partnerships. All of our recipe cards feature cooking tools and utensils from Blue Apron Market, creating an integrated brand experience for our community of home cooks and repeated merchandising opportunities for our company. Our wines are also sold on the Blue Apron Market website.
Digital Experience 
Customers can find recipes, register their dietary preferences, manage their accounts, and make purchases on our website or on our iOS and Android mobile applications. Our digital customer experience is immersive: we offer how-to cooking videos, stories about our suppliers, a step-by-step interactive cook along, and our collection of thousands of recipes that customers can access on their own.
How We Do It
We have created an integrated network that enables us to source high quality, differentiated ingredients, design original recipes around those ingredients, and combine them into meaningful cooking experiences that we deliver to customers across the contiguous United States. Our interconnected end-to-end value chain allows us to execute cost-effectively and at scale. Coordination between our culinary team, procurement and operations teams, our marketing practices, and technology tools help us pair customer demand with supply, as well as to work with our suppliers to deliver high quality food at compelling values. Our fulfillment and logistics operations are built to support our ongoing product innovation.
Supply-Demand Coordination 
Our supply-demand coordination activities include demand planning, recipe development, recipe merchandising, and marketing. We use near-term and long-term demand forecasting based on proprietary data and software to inform decisions along our value chain, including fulfillment center capacity and ingredient purchasing. This process continues through recipe development, and merchandising, as we craft recipes around available ingredients, and have the ability to make adjustments up to just a few weeks prior to fulfillment. We have also tailored our marketing strategies based on these demand forecasts and planning to optimize our marketing return on investment.
Supplier Relationships
Our deep supplier relationships provide us access to a supply of high quality ingredients. This enables us to collaborate on demand planning to manage inventories, optimize yields and subsequently to reduce waste and cost while minimizing our supply chain footprint. Blue Apron often aims to work directly with farmers when practicable to ensure customers receive high quality, seasonally inspired produce at optimal freshness. We collaborate with farmers, ranchers, fisheries, and other suppliers to source meat, seafood, and poultry products that meet our animal welfare standards, 

9



enabling us to provide premium ingredients to our customers such as pasture raised beef and Certified Humane Raised and Handled® pasture raised eggs. 
Operations
Our purchasing, production, fulfillment, and logistics operations are integrated with our demand management and supplier relationships. Successfully integrating these disparate activities requires us to possess a variety of competencies: a team with deep, ingredient-specific expertise; a technology-enabled platform that connects our end-to-end operations; and a scalable architecture that adapts to surges in demand as well as variations in available supply. Our enhanced planning and process-driven strategies enable us to make informed purchasing decisions and provide opportunities to better manage food costs, allocate labor and reduce waste in our fulfillment centers.
Informed Purchasing
While we work directly with our suppliers months in advance to plan our supply needs, we place purchase orders closer to the expected fulfillment, after coordinating supply and demand through processes such as recipe merchandising and analyzing the outputs of our demand planning and forecasting tools.
Production and Fulfillment
As of December 31, 2020, we operated two fulfillment centers. Our fulfillment centers are designed to effectively manage our variable, high-throughput, perishable inventory, as well as flexible production and labor needs. We have invested extensively in our fulfillment centers, including the launch of our Linden, New Jersey center in 2017 and the implementation of automation equipment in our Linden and Richmond fulfillment centers, and continue to optimize our network with a focus on maximizing efficiencies. In November 2020, we announced a plan to temporarily reopen our fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas beginning in January 2021 following the closure of that facility in the second quarter of 2020. This temporary reopening is designed to allow us to focus on utilizing existing assets to help address some of the capacity constraints we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to supplement labor while we continue to implement operating efficiencies at our other fulfillment centers. 
Because we prep and ship perishable products, our fulfillment centers must adhere to stringent food safety standards, temperature protocols, and regulatory guidelines, and our fulfillment centers are staffed with trained professionals to ensure that our ingredients adhere to our food safety and quality standards. Our Linden and Richmond fulfillment centers are certified under the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Food Safety Code for Manufacturing nationwide, a globally recognized, independent food safety standard administered by the Safe Quality Food Institute. Our Arlington fulfillment center was also SQF-certified prior to its closing in the second quarter of 2020.
To support our fulfillment operations we have developed proprietary technology, such as our proprietary inventory management tools to assess incoming ingredients for quality and our proprietary kitchen prep software that demonstrates to fulfillment center associates how to prep ingredients for each recipe, and provides instructions on selecting the correct type of packaging for each ingredient. We also use third-party technology in fulfillment operations to complement our proprietary systems. 
Logistics
Our logistics team designs, manages, and optimizes a ground-based delivery network comprised of several third-party partners capable of delivering within the contiguous United States. We analyze outbound logistics on a zip code by zip code basis to enable cost-effective and timely delivery of orders, while also adjusting the packaging of our ingredients and other components of our fulfillment operations based on the expected delivery route, weather, or ultimate destination. All of our packaging materials are chosen with environmental impact in mind. We select packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable when practicable. Our packaging innovation team, with the support of third party sustainability experts, is focused on innovating to improve our packaging design, lower overall costs, and reduce our carbon footprint.

Our Brand and Marketing
We are continuing to build a consumer lifestyle brand that empowers our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference cooking quality food can make in their lives. Several nights a week, our customers invite us into their homes. We take part in some of the most joyful parts of their days, helping them create a meal for themselves, their families and their loved ones. Their challenges are opportunities for us to learn together, and their accomplishments are among our proudest achievements. We hear their success stories every day. Unlike a purely transactional e-commerce platform, we believe the emotional connection that customers have with our brand will enable us to have a more meaningful role in their lives. 
We believe in utilizing a strategic mix of marketing channels to efficiently add new customers as well as to engage and create value for our existing customers. This includes a diverse mix of online and offline channels, as well as strategic partnerships that enable us to expand our brand to new segments of customers. We deliberately focus on the marketing channels we believe to be the most efficient and on customer segments that have demonstrated stronger affinity and retention. We believe our customers continue to be some of our best marketers, and we see them share their Blue Apron moments through social media, blogs, and referrals. We also have a customer referral program through which certain existing customers may invite others to receive a single complimentary meal kit box.
For all of our products, we use a combination of paid, earned, and owned media to increase the awareness of our brand and attract new customers. Our content enables customers to connect and interact with our brand even when they are not cooking with us. For example, we leverage both our digital channels and printed content within deliveries to highlight specific ingredients, provide general cooking tips and techniques and foster conversation within our community of home cooks.
Finally, strategic brand partnerships are an important opportunity for us to leverage the platform we are building to add value for our existing customers and showcase our brand to new customer segments. 
Our Customers
Our customers represent a broad range of demographics including a wide range of age groups and incomes. Customers of all kinds are able to successfully incorporate Blue Apron into a wide variety of lifestyles.

We also believe our customers roughly mirror the general geographical population distribution of the United States. According to the 2015 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, the top ten states account for 54% of total U.S. households. Similarly, we estimate that these states accounted for 58% of our customers in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Our Competition
The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we face an array of competitors from many different industry sectors. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) other food and meal delivery companies; (2) the supermarket industry, including online supermarket retailers; (3) a wide array of food retailers, including natural and organic, specialty, conventional, mass, discount, and other food retail formats; (4) casual dining and quick-service restaurants and other food service businesses in the restaurant industry; (5) online wine retailers, wine specialty stores, and retail liquor stores; and (6) food manufacturers, consumer packaged goods companies, providers of logistics services, and other food and ingredient producers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors upon which we compete include: marketing; variety and flexibility of product offering; price and value perception; brand reputation; product quality (including uniqueness of ingredients, flavors and techniques); customer satisfaction; convenience; food safety; customer service; and reliable and timely fulfillment.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology and our customer data, is an important factor in our strategy and the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark and copyright, and other intellectual property protections under applicable law. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also seek 

12



to protect and avoid disclosure of our intellectual property through confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees, and through appropriate agreements with our suppliers and others. We have two registered patents related to product packaging.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulatory requirements, including regulation of our food and wine operations.
Government Regulation of Foods and Food Companies
Food companies, such as Blue Apron, are subject to extensive government regulation. Federal statutes applicable to food production include, for example, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Federal regulators have promulgated extensive regulatory schemes to implement these and other relevant statutes. These evolving regulatory structures govern matters including manufacturing, formulating, labeling, advertising, packaging, storing, and implementing safety measures for our food products. In particular, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, continues its implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act by promulgating substantial numbers of new regulations and introducing multiple versions of non-binding, draft guidance documents suggesting new compliance measures for the food industry. Understanding within the food industry of how to apply these regulations and the suggestions offered in FDA guidance documents continues to evolve.
State and local jurisdictions also regulate U.S. food manufacturing facilities. For example, we currently produce and fulfill products in the states of California, New Jersey, and Texas. State and local governments exert regulatory authority over our operations in these jurisdictions. The states and localities in which a food production facility is located can impose registration, licensing, and inspection requirements in addition to those imposed by federal law. Some also enforce significant consumer protection-focused statutory schemes, which can impose additional costs and complexity on food producers.
Food companies in the United States are subject to government inspection with or without notice at any time, with concomitant responsibility to provide access to facilities and equipment, produce extensive operational documentation, and furnish product, packaging, and labeling samples for governmental examination. Federal, state, and local governmental agencies enjoy extensive discretion to determine whether, when and how to conduct these activities. Food companies are therefore vulnerable to unexpected business interruptions and publicity.
All food companies in the United States bear legal responsibility for any violation of applicable food laws or regulations, whether that violation is negligent, non-negligent, or deliberate. Any U.S. company found to have violated food laws or regulations may have its products seized, its operations enjoined, its goods recalled from the market and destroyed, and its business exposed to significant adverse publicity. It is also possible that new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing requirements, might require us to change our compliance policies, incur additional cost, or result in unexpected liabilities that could be significant.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
We maintain a food safety and quality program to verify that the food products supplied to our customers are processed in a safe and sanitary environment and are in compliance with applicable food safety and regulatory requirements and standards. All meat and poultry products that we source are processed in facilities inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or by the equivalent agencies in countries deemed eligible by USDA for exporting meat and poultry to the United States. Accordingly, these products must conform to USDA requirements. All food and packaging suppliers are prequalified and have agreed to comply with our requirements. While we perform supplier inspections and conduct product audits to evaluate suppliers and products for compliance with our company standards and specifications, we may not be able to prevent individual suppliers from failing to comply with food safety 

13



laws or our requirements, and we may not be able to locate each failure to comply with food safety laws or our requirements prior to receiving food products. We operate a toll-free customer call center to capture and address telephonic and electronic customer feedback, including inquiries and complaints about the safety and quality of our food products.
Government Regulation of Our Wine Business
The production, sale, and shipment of wine in the United States are each regulated by the federal government and by each state government. State laws are not uniform, so business models that are national in scope must account for the state-by-state rules to achieve compliance.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary BAW, Inc., or BAW, is a licensed California winery, and must comply with federal and California law controlling winery operations. Various regulations control production, excise tax, labeling, alcohol content and recordkeeping. In addition, the promotion and marketing of wine, including pricing, is subject to federal or state regulations. For example, wine marketing cannot be targeted to children, and some states restrict excessive discounts on wine. To assist with federal and state regulatory compliance, BAW relies on various internal and external personnel with relevant experience. 
Alcohol distribution in the United States is traditionally conducted through a “three tier” system, in which alcohol passes from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer in each state, before it can be sold to a consumer. However, applicable state regulations permit manufacturers to ship wine directly to consumers around the country. As a licensed California winery, BAW relies on such regulations to sell and ship wine to the residents of 31 states plus the District of Columbia. Each state permit held by BAW has specific compliance requirements, such as monthly reporting, limits on the amount of wine that can be shipped to a given household, and obtaining an adult signature on delivery.
Human Capital Management
Overview of Human Capital Management
We believe our employees are the foundation of our success. As a direct to consumer business, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, engineers, culinary and food safety professionals, fulfillment center employees and customer service employees. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations. Our overall talent acquisition and retention strategy is designed to attract and retain qualified employees to meet our business goals on an ongoing basis and to execute on our growth strategy.
​
As of January 31, 2021, we employed 2,045 full-time employees, of which approximately 85% were engaged in fulfillment operations. The number of employees employed as of January 31, 2021 includes 172 full-time fulfillment center employees based in our Arlington, Texas fulfillment center, which we temporarily reopened in the first quarter of 2021 to help address the labor shortages we have experienced in our New Jersey and California fulfillment centers. From time to time in order to sufficiently meet business needs, we supplement our hourly fulfillment and customer service staffing with temporary personnel.
​
Our human resource strategy is overseen by our executive team and senior human resource professionals and consultants, and management aims to provide regular updates to our board of directors. The management team also seeks input from the operations team when designing human resource strategy for our fulfilment centers. 
​
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Attraction, Retention, and Development of Talent
Our human resource strategy is focused on the attraction, retention and development of employees across the company, from our fulfillment centers to our test kitchen to our corporate offices. Our ability to attract, retain and improve the effectiveness of employees is a critical factor for executing our growth strategy. We strive to recruit the best 

14



people for the job regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences. ​
 Through much of 2020, we experienced hourly employee labor shortages at our fulfillment centers. We believe these labor shortages were primarily caused by factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as reduced public transportation, childcare issues and employee fears of COVID-19, as well as the challenges of recruiting while adhering to social distancing and contact tracing for staff and candidates. We have also experienced labor shortages as a result of employees required to stay home after testing positive for COVID-19 or having been exposed to someone who has tested positive. In order to address labor constraints, we have been reviewing and revising our practices with respect to recruiting, retention and training as part of our ongoing commitment to recruit and retain a strong employee base. We have also established a number of operating practice improvements in our fulfillment centers, including labor, packaging, and equipment optimizations, in order to increase fulfillment center capacity and reduce the labor hours required to run our business. 
​
There are several ways in which we focus on attracting talented employees, recognizing and rewarding them for their performance, and developing, engaging and retaining them, including:

● | Focusing on the health and safety of our employees. In addition to COVID-19 precautions discussed below, our goal is to operate our business in a manner that results in zero workplace injuries and illnesses through training our employees on proper health and safety practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hosting weekly events at our fulfillment centers to provide our fulfillment center employees access to high quality ingredients for meals at home, at no cost to them, while enriching engagement with the Blue Apron brand;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing wages for all hourly fulfillment center employees in 2020 and using incentive programs to increase attendance rates and reduce attrition in our fulfillment centers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Launching a pilot mentoring program in 2020 across the company for our employees designed to achieve a number of goals, including accelerating the development of top performers, increasing organizational learning, and improving employee performance and retention; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adopting a strict COVID-19 health and safety protocol, as described below.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees has been and remains our top priority. We have a dedicated environmental, health & safety (EHS) team composed of representatives from across the company. The EHS team coordinates health and safety matters at all of our locations, including safety training at our fulfillment centers. Our team regularly evaluates injury rates, safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at our fulfillment centers to enhance worker safety. In addition to this team, we also have a food safety and quality assurance team (FSQA) which focuses on maintaining good manufacturing practices at our fulfillment centers in accordance with FDA guidance.
​
Beginning in March 2020, and continuing into 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has been and is presenting unprecedented challenges in many parts of our businesses and operations, including with respect to our most valuable asset - our people. In response, we developed and implemented new procedures and protocols to minimize the risk to the health and safety of our employees while allowing us to continue to operate our facilities and provide high quality products to our customers on a timely basis. Throughout the pandemic, we have been able to continue to service our customers, while at the same time making investments to prioritize the health, safety, and welfare of our employees. 
​
In particular, our comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes:

● | Creating a COVID-19 Action Team composed of a cross-functional team of corporate and fulfillment center employees, including representatives from Operations (including FSQA and EHS teams), Legal, Human
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resources and Internal Communications, that is responsible for reviewing and investigating all COVID-19 cases and precaution policies;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Forming Wellness Teams at each fulfillment center to monitor and reach out to employees impacted by COVID-19, whether due to having a positive diagnosis, having been exposed, or displaying symptoms;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing a contact tracing program both through oral intake interviews, as well as reviewing security video footage to identify close contacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adopting a COVID-19 Cleaning and Disinfecting Policy, which established additional cleaning and sanitation practices on top of the robust sanitation protocols we already undertake as FDA regulated facilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing temperature screening of employees and visitors entering any of our fulfillment centers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing physical distancing procedures for employees at our fulfillment centers and, where open, our corporate offices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing all fulfillment center employees with face coverings, and requiring face coverings to be worn in and around all of our locations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modifying workspaces with physical dividers where possible and reducing seating in conference and meeting rooms, as well as in common spaces and break and lunch rooms;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creating additional outdoor break areas at our California fulfillment center;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Staggering shifts and start, stop and break times at our fulfillment centers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Installing additional handwashing stations and self-service sanitation dispensers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mandating work from home for our corporate, call center and test kitchen employees, as well as a limited number of salaried fulfillment center roles since mid-March 2020 in order to minimize the number of employees in our offices and facilities, with some programs for limited openings at some of those offices overseen by our cross-functional COVID-19 Return to Office Task Force; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prohibiting non-essential business travel for employees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Initiatives
We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our business experiences. As part of our investment in our people, we strive to make diversity, equity and inclusion a priority. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. By recognizing and celebrating our differences, our goal is to cultivate an environment that is inclusive and represents our core values and mission. We also demonstrate diversity, equity, and inclusion at the highest levels of our company with, as of January 31, 2021, 80% of our executive leadership team and 57% of our board of directors (and 75% of our independent directors) being female.​
In 2020, we created and launched our “Aprons for All” Task Force, which is our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (or “DEI”) task force sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and led by our Head of Sustainability and Social Impact. This task force represents locations, tenures, functions and business segments across the company. Our “Aprons for All” Task Force plans to include the following initiatives in our DEI roadmap:

16




● | Implementing a DEI learning and development plan to build awareness and drive inclusive behaviors and attitudes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing our diversity pipeline through hiring, mentoring, and coaching.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In tandem with our “Aprons for All” Task Force, we have also created an “Aprons for All” Thought Partners Group to serve as advocates and as an idea-generating platform for DEI initiatives. This team conducts regular brainstorming sessions and previews the programs planned by the “Aprons for All” Task Force before they are rolled out.
