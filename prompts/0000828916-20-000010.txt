ITEM 1. Business
General Development of Business.    Weingarten Realty Investors is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) organized under the Texas Business Organizations Code. We, and our predecessor entity, began the ownership of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in 1948. Our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping centers we own or lease. We also provide property management services for which we charge fees to either joint ventures where we are partners or other outside owners.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for information on certain recent developments of the Company. 
Narrative Description of Business.    We are in the business of owning, managing and developing retail shopping centers. These centers may be mixed-use properties that have both retail and residential components. At December 31, 2019, we owned or operated under long-term leases, either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships, a total of 170 properties, which are located in 16 states spanning the country from coast to coast. The portfolio of properties contains approximately 32.5 million square feet of gross leasable area that is either owned by us or others. We also owned interests in 23 parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately 11.9 million square feet.
Investment and Operating Strategy.    Our goal is to remain a leader in owning and operating top-tier neighborhood and community shopping centers in certain markets of the United States ("U.S."). We expect to achieve this goal by:

• | raising net asset value and cash flows through quality acquisitions, redevelopments and new developments;


• | focusing on core operating fundamentals through our decentralized operating platform built on local expertise in leasing and property management;


• | disciplined growth from strategic acquisitions, redevelopments and new developments;


• | disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria, in which proceeds may be recycled by repaying debt, purchasing new assets or reinvesting in currently owned assets or for other corporate purposes; and


• | commitment to maintaining a conservatively leveraged balance sheet, strong liquidity, a well-staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings.

We may either purchase, develop or lease income-producing properties in the future, and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership. 
We may invest in mortgages; however, we have traditionally invested in first mortgages to real estate joint ventures or partnerships in which we own an equity interest or to obtain control over a real estate asset that we desire to own. We may also invest in securities of other issuers for the purpose, among others, of exercising control over such entities, subject to the gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification.
In acquiring and developing properties, we attempt to accumulate enough properties in a geographic area to allow for the establishment of a regional office, which enables us to obtain in-depth knowledge of the market from a leasing perspective and to have easy access to the property and our tenants from a management viewpoint.
We expect to continue our focus on the future growth of the portfolio in neighborhood and community shopping centers in markets where we currently operate throughout the U.S. Our markets of interest reflect high income and job growth, as well as high barriers-to-entry. Our attention is also focused on high quality, supermarket-anchored and necessity-based centers, which may include mixed-use properties containing this type of retail component in addition to a residential component.
Diversification from both a geographic and tenancy perspective is a critical component of our operating strategy. Our largest markets are located in California, Florida and Texas, which represent 10.0%, 21.4% and 31.8%, respectively, of our total properties' gross leasable area. Total revenues generated by our centers located in Houston and its surrounding areas was 20.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, and an additional 9.3% of total revenue was generated in 2019 from centers that are located in other parts of Texas. An additional 19.8% and 17.9% of total revenue was generated in 2019 by our centers located in Florida and California, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we also had 23 parcels of land held for development, five of which were located in Houston and its surrounding areas and 10 of which were located in other parts of Texas. Because of our investments in Texas, including Houston and its surrounding areas, Florida and California, changes in economic or real estate conditions in any of these areas could more significantly affect our business and operations than changes in other geographic areas.
With respect to tenant diversification, our two largest tenants, TJX Companies, Inc. and The Kroger Co., accounted for 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively, of our total base minimum rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. No other tenant accounted for more than 1.8% of our total base minimum rental revenues. Our anchor tenants are supermarkets, value-oriented apparel/discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity-type goods and services. We believe the stability of our anchor tenants, combined with convenient locations, attractive and well-maintained properties, high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix, should ensure the long-term viability of our portfolio.
Strategically, we strive to finance our growth and working capital needs in a conservative manner, including managing our debt maturities. Our senior debt credit ratings were BBB with a projected stable outlook from Standard & Poors and Baa1 with a projected stable outlook from Moody’s Investor Services as of December 31, 2019. We intend to maintain a conservative approach to managing our balance sheet, which, in turn, should permit us to raise debt or equity capital when needed. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our debt to total assets before depreciation ratio was 34.3% and 36.4%, respectively.
We have a $200 million share repurchase plan under which we may repurchase common shares of beneficial interest ("common shares") from time-to-time in open-market or privately negotiated purchases based on management's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. As of the date of this filing, $181.5 million of common shares remained available to be repurchased under the plan.
Our policies with respect to the investment and operating strategies discussed above are periodically reviewed by our Board of Trust Managers and may be modified without a vote of our shareholders.
Competition.    We compete with numerous other developers and real estate companies (both public and private), financial institutions and other investors engaged in the development, acquisition and operation of shopping centers and mixed-use properties in our geographical areas. This results in competition for the acquisition of both existing income-producing properties and prime development sites.
We also compete for tenants to occupy the space that is developed, acquired and managed by our competitors. The principal competitive factors in attracting tenants to our properties are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance of properties. We believe our key competitive advantages include the favorable locations of our properties, the strong demographics surrounding our centers, knowledge of markets and customer bases, our ability to provide a retailer with multiple locations with quality anchor tenants and the practice of continuous maintenance and renovation of our properties.
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust.    As of December 31, 2019, we met the qualification requirements of a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. As a result, we will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, with the exception of our taxable REIT subsidiary.
Employees.    At December 31, 2019, we employed 239 full-time persons; our principal executive offices are located at 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008; and our phone number is (713) 866-6000. We also have nine regional offices located in various parts of the U.S. Management considers its relations with their personnel to be good.
Sustainability.    We believe sustainability to be in the best interest of our tenants, investors, employees and the communities we operate. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact and believe this commitment is not only the right thing to do, but also supports us in achieving key strategic objectives in operations and development. More information about our sustainability initiatives, performance and disclosures are available on our website at www.weingarten.com.
Environmental Exposure.    We are under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations that may cause us to be liable for costs and damages to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances as an operator and owner of real estate. For further information regarding our risks related to environmental exposure, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
