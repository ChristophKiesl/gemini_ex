ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Business
A Delaware corporation formed in 1997, we are an independent natural gas-weighted exploration and production company with assets primarily located in the Appalachia and Anadarko basins. Our corporate strategy is focused on the economic development of our asset base in an effort to generate sustainable free cash flow. Our principal properties are located in Eastern Ohio, where we target development in the Utica formation, and Central Oklahoma where we target development in the SCOOP Woodford and Springer formations. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.6 Tcfe of proved reserves with a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of $540.0 million and a PV-10 of $540.0 million. See "Definitions" above for our definition of PV-10 (a non-GAAP financial measure) and "Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves" below for a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to PV-10.

Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code 
On November 13, 2020, Gulfport Energy Corporation, Gator Marine, Inc., Gator Marine Ivanhoe, Inc., Grizzly Holdings, Inc., Gulfport Appalachia, LLC, Gulfport Midcon, LLC, Gulfport Midstream Holdings, LLC, Jaguar Resources LLC, Mule Sky LLC, Puma Resources, Inc. and Westhawk Minerals LLC filed voluntary petitions of relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Chapter 11 Cases are being administered jointly under the caption In re Gulfport Energy Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-35562 (DRJ). Information about our Chapter 11 cases is available at our website (www.gulfportenergy.com).
We are currently operating our business and managing our properties as debtors in possession pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. On November 14, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the joint administration and procedural consolidation of these Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 1015(b). At the first day hearing on November 16, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court granted certain requested relief enabling us to conduct our business activities in the ordinary course, including, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing us to pay employee wages and benefits, pay taxes and certain governmental fees and charges, continue to operate our cash management system in the ordinary course, remit funds we hold from time to time for the benefit of third parties (such as royalty owners), and pay the pre-petition claims of certain of our vendors that hold liens under applicable non-bankruptcy law. For goods and services provided following the Petition Date, we are permitted and intend to pay vendors in the ordinary course.
Subject to certain exceptions provided for in section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, all judicial and administrative proceedings against us or our property were automatically enjoined, or stayed, as of the Petition Date. In addition, the filing of new judicial or administrative actions against us or our property for claims arising prior to the date on which our Chapter 11 Cases were filed were automatically enjoined. This prohibits, for example, our lenders or noteholders from pursuing claims for defaults under our debt agreements and our contract counterparties from pursuing claims for defaults under our contracts. Accordingly, unless the Bankruptcy Court agrees to lift the automatic stay, all of our pre-petition liabilities and obligations should be settled or compromised under the Bankruptcy Code as part of our Chapter 11 proceedings.
Our operations and ability to execute our business remain subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A.“Risk Factors”. In addition, our assets, liabilities, capital structure, shareholders, officers and directors could change materially because of our Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this

Annual Report on Form 10-K may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans after we emerge from Chapter 11.
Business Strategy
Gulfport aims to create sustainable value through the development of our significant resource plays in the Utica and SCOOP operating areas. Our strategy is to develop our assets in a manner that generates sustainable cash flow and improves margins and operating efficiencies, while maintaining exceptional environmental and safety performance. To accomplish these goals, we allocate capital expenditures to projects we believe offer the highest rate of return and we deploy leading drilling and completion techniques and technologies in our development efforts. 
As noted above, we are currently engaged in an in-court restructuring process to improve our balance sheet strength, cost structure and financial strength and flexibility. 
Operating Areas
We focus our development and production activities in the geographic operating areas described below.
Utica - The Utica is a hydrocarbon bearing rock formation located in the Appalachian Basin of the United States and Canada. We have approximately 193,000 net reservoir acres located primarily in Belmont, Harrison, Jefferson and Monroe Counties in Eastern Ohio where the Utica ranges in thickness from 600 to over 750 feet. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we produced approximately 887 MMcfe per day net to our interests in this area and accounts for approximately 82% of our total production.
SCOOP - The SCOOP, or South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, is a defined area that encompasses many of the top hydrocarbon producing counties in Oklahoma within the Anadarko basin. The SCOOP play mainly targets the Devonian to Mississippian aged Woodford, Sycamore and Springer formations. We have approximately 73,000 net reservoir acres (comprised of approximately 40,000 in the Woodford formation and approximately 33,000 in the Springer formation) located primarily in Garvin, Grady and Stephens Counties. The Woodford Shale across our position ranges in thickness from 200 to over 400 feet and directly overlies the Hunton Limestone and underlies the Sycamore formation, both of which are also locally productive reservoirs. The Sycamore formation consists of hydrocarbon-bearing interbedded shales and siliceous limestones ranging in thickness from 150 to over 450 feet and is overlain by the Caney Shale. The Springer formation across our position is comprised of a series of lenticular sand and shale units. The primary targets are a series of porous, low clay and organic-rich packages within the Goddard Shale member ranging in thickness from 50 to over 250 feet. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we produced approximately 189 MMcfe per day net to our interests in this area and accounts for approximately 18% of our total production.
Additional Properties - In addition to our core properties discussed above, we also own working interests and overriding royalty interest in various fields including the Bakken formation in North Dakota that account for less than 1% of our total production and proved reserves.
Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth information with respect to operated wells drilled during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Of our leases that are not held by production, most have a three- to five-year primary term, many of which include options to extend the primary term. We manage lease expirations to ensure that we do not experience unintended material expirations. Our leasehold management efforts include scheduling our operations to establish production in paying quantities in order to hold leases prior to the expiration dates, paying the prescribed lease extension payments, planning non-core divestitures or strategic acreage trades with other operators to high-grade our lease inventory and letting some leases expire that are no longer part of our development plans. The following table sets forth the potential expiration periods of gross and net undeveloped leasehold acres as of December 31, 2020.

Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves 
The tables below set forth information as of December 31, 2020, with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the associated estimated future net revenue, the PV-10 and the standardized measure. None of the estimated future net revenue, PV-10 nor the standardized measure are intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves we own. All of our estimated reserves are located within the United States.

_____________________
(1)    Utica and SCOOP accounted for approximately 67% and 33%, respectively, of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2020.
(2)    Estimated future net revenue represents the estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2020, and assuming commodity prices as set forth below. For the purpose of determining prices used in our reserve reports, we used the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020. The prices used in our PV-10 measure were $39.54 per barrel and $1.99 per MMBtu, before basis differential adjustments. These prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices, nor do they reflect the value of our commodity derivative instruments in place as of December 31, 2020. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property-related expenses, such as corporate general and administrative expenses and debt service, or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. The present value of estimated future net revenue typically differs from the standardized measure because the former does not include the effects of estimated future income tax expense. There was no effect of estimated future income tax expense as of December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of significant net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to offset income taxes on future taxable income.

    Management uses PV-10, which is calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses, as a measure of the value of the Company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies. We also 
Index to Financial Statements
understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways. While estimated future net revenue and the present value thereof are based on prices, costs and discount factors which may be consistent from company to company, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 

    A reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented above. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved oil and gas reserves.

Grizzly had no proved reserves as of December 31, 2020. For further discussion of our interest in Grizzly, see “Our Equity Investments” below. 
Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have not filed any estimates of total, proved net oil or gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the SEC since the beginning of our last fiscal year. 
Changes in Proved Reserves during 2020.
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2020 (in Bcfe):

Proved Reserves, December 31, 2019 | 4,528 
Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place | (75) 
Extensions and discoveries | 240 
Revisions of prior reserve estimates | (1,725)
Current production | (380) 
Proved Reserves, December 31, 2020 | 2,588 

Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place. These are reductions to proved reserves resulting from the divestiture of minerals in place during a period. During 2020, we sold approximately 74.9 Bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves through various sales of our non-operated interests in our Utica assets.
Extensions and discoveries. These are additions to our proved reserves that result from extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery. Extensions of approximately 239.8 Bcfe of proved reserves were primarily attributable to the continued development of our Utica and SCOOP acreage. We added 14 PUD locations in our Utica acreage for 150.6 Bcfe and eight PUD locations in our SCOOP acreage for 87.8 Bcfe. The commodity prices utilized for the 2020 reserves determination as well as our revised five-year development plan focused on generating sustainable cash flow limited our ability to add significant well locations.
Revisions of prior reserve estimates. Revisions represent changes in previous reserve estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from development plan changes, new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs or development costs.
We experienced total downward revisions of 1.7 Tcfe in estimated proved reserves, of which 1,268.4 Bcfe was the result of commodity price changes. Commodity prices experienced volatility throughout 2020 and the 12-month average price for natural gas decreased from $2.58 per MMBtu for 2019 to $1.99 per MMBtu for 2020, the 12-month average price for NGL decreased from $21.25 per barrel for 2019 to $15.40 per barrel for 2020, and the 12-month average price for crude oil decreased from $55.85 per barrel for 2019 to $39.54 per barrel for 2020. 
Index to Financial Statements
An additional 720.3 Bcfe in downward revisions was a result of the exclusion of 48 PUD locations in our Utica field and 31 PUD locations in our SCOOP field when changes in our schedule moved development of these PUD locations beyond five years of initial booking. The development plan change reflects our commitment to capital discipline and funding future activities within cash flow and ongoing optimization of our development plan.
Positive revisions of 263.8 Bcfe were experienced from a combination of operating and development cost improvements, well performance and working interest changes.
Additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and changes in proved reserves during the last three years are contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities, or Supplemental Information, in Note 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs) 
As of December 31, 2020, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 7 MMBbl of oil, 923 Bcf of natural gas and 16 MMBbl of NGL, for a total of 1,061 Bcfe. Approximately 60% and 40% of our PUD reserves at year-end 2020 were located in Utica and SCOOP, respectively. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells commence production or there are no material incremental completion capital expenditures associated with such proved developed reserves. 
We record PUD reserves only after a development plan has been approved by our senior management and board of directors to complete the associated development drilling within five years from the time of initial booking. The PUD locations identified in our development plan are determined based on an analysis of the information that we have available at that time. After a development plan has been adopted, we may periodically make adjustments to the approved development plan due to events and circumstances that have occurred subsequent to the time the plan was approved. These circumstances may include changes in commodity price outlook and costs, delays in the availability of infrastructure, well permitting delays and new data from recently completed wells. 
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2020 (in Bcfe):

Proved Undeveloped Reserves, December 31, 2019 | 2,544 
Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place | (74) 
Extensions and discoveries | 238 
Conversion to proved developed reserves | (368) 
Revisions of prior reserve estimates | (1,279)
Proved Undeveloped Reserves, December 31, 2020 | 1,061 

Sales of oil and natural gas reserves in place. During 2020, we sold approximately 74.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves associated with various operated interests, the majority of which were in our Utica field.
Extensions and discoveries. Our extensions of approximately 238.4 Bcfe were primarily attributed to the addition of 14 PUD drilling locations in the Utica field and eight PUD drilling locations in the SCOOP field as a result of our current development plan that refocused some activity within our existing fields. The commodity prices utilized for the 2020 reserves determination and our revised five-year development plan focused on generating sustainable cash flow limited our ability to add well locations.
Conversion to proved developed reserves. Our 2020 development activities resulted in the conversion of approximately 367.7 Bcfe into proved developed producing reserves, attributable to 25 PUD locations in the Utica field and 10 PUD locations in the SCOOP field. These 35 PUDs represent a conversion rate of 14% for 2020.
Revision of prior reserve estimates. We experienced proved undeveloped downward revisions of 720.3 Bcfe from the exclusion of 48 PUD locations in our Utica field and 31 PUD locations in our SCOOP field due to the SEC five-year development rule. The development plan change, as approved by our senior management and Board of Directors, reflects our commitment to capital discipline, funding future activities within cash flow and ongoing optimization of our development plan. 
Index to Financial Statements
We also experienced 842.9 Bcfe of downward revisions as a result of commodity price changes. These downward revisions were partially offset by positive revisions of 283.7 Bcfe in estimated proved reserves from a combination of operating and development cost improvements, well performance and working interest changes.
Costs incurred relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $182.3 million in 2020. 
All PUD drilling locations included in our 2020 reserve report are scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking. 
As of December 31, 2020, less than 1% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing.
Reserves Estimation
Reserve estimates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") for all of our operating areas. 
NSAI is an independent petroleum engineering firm. A copy of the summary reserve reports is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our independent third-party engineers do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis. 
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with NSAI, our independent reserve engineers, to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves. Our internal technical team members meet with NSAI periodically throughout the year to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to NSAI for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices, operating and development costs and other considerations, including availability and costs of infrastructure and status of permits. Our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. He is a petroleum engineer with over 20 years of reservoir and operations experience. In addition, our geophysical staff has approximately 85 years combined industry experience and our reservoir staff has approximately 50 years combined experience. 
Our proved reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following: 
•review and verification of historical production, operating, marketing and capital data, which data is based on actual production as reported by us; 
•verification of property ownership by our land department;
•preparation of reserve estimates by NSAI in coordination with our experienced reservoir engineers; 
•direct reporting responsibilities by our reservoir engineering department to our Chief Operating Officer; 
•review by our reservoir engineering department of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions; 
•provision of quarterly updates to our board of directors regarding operational data, including production, drilling and completion activity levels and any significant changes in our reserves;
•annual review by our board of directors of our year-end reserve report and year-over-year changes in our proved reserves, as well as any changes to our previously adopted development plans;
•annual review and approval by our senior management and our board of directors of a multi-year development plan; 
•annual review by our senior management of adjustments to our previously adopted development plan and considerations involved in making such adjustments; and
•annual review by our board of directors of changes in our previously approved development plan made by senior management and technical staff during the year, including the substitution, removal or deferral of PUD locations.

PV-10 Sensitivities
As noted above, our December 31, 2020 proved reserves were calculated using prices based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for the period January through December 2020 of $39.54 per barrel and $1.99 per MMBtu. Holding production and development costs constant, if SEC pricing were $43.49 per barrel and $2.19 per MMBtu, or a 10% increase, this would have resulted in an increase of 181.7 Bcfe of our total proved reserves and a $350 million increase in PV-10 value at December 31, 2020. Holding production and development costs constant, if SEC pricing were $35.59 per barrel and $1.79 per MMBtu, or a 10% decrease, this would have resulted in a decrease of 839.9 Bcfe of our total proved reserves and a $228 million decrease in PV-10 value at December 31, 2020. For each of these scenarios, the 82 PUDs that were economic at SEC pricing were included.
Holding production and development costs constant while assuming SEC pricing closer to the long-term strip pricing of $50.00 per barrel for crude oil and $2.50 per MMBtu for natural gas results in an increase of 1,065 Bcfe of total proved reserves and a $989 million increase in PV-10 value at December 31, 2020. For this scenario, there were an additional 55 PUD locations included that were economic at these prices.

Our Equity Investments
Grizzly Oil Sands. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Grizzly Holdings Inc., own a 24.5% interest in Grizzly. As of December 31, 2020, Grizzly had approximately 830,000 net acres under lease in the Athabasca, Peace River and Cold Lake oil sands regions of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly's operations have been suspended since 2016. Additionally, Grizzly had no proved reserves as of December 31, 2020. We elected to cease funding capital calls in 2019, and we have no obligation to fund any of the projects Grizzly is pursuing. Failure to fund capital calls may lead to continued dilution of our equity ownership interest in Grizzly.
Mammoth Energy. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 9,829,548 shares, or approximately 21.5%, of the outstanding common stock of Mammoth Energy Services Inc. 
See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our equity investments.
Marketing 
The principal function of our marketing operations is to provide natural gas, oil and NGL marketing services, including securing and negotiating commodity transactions, gathering, hauling, processing and transportation services, contract 
Index to Financial Statements
administration and nomination services for production from Gulfport-operated wells. In addition, we periodically enter into a variety of oil, natural gas and NGL purchase and sale contracts with third parties for various commercial purposes, including risk mitigation and satisfaction of our firm transportation delivery commitments. These marketing activities often enhance the value of our production by aggregating volumes and allowing improved flexibility in relation to deal structure, size and counterparty exposure whether through intermediary markets or direct end markets. 
Generally, natural gas and NGL production is sold to purchasers under both spot and term transactions. Oil production is sold under both spot and term transactions with the majority of our sales contracts being shorter term in nature. We have entered into long-term gathering, processing and transportation contracts with various parties that reserve capacity for fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Some contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under these commitments. See Note 17 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our commitments.
Major Customers
Our total natural gas, oil and NGL revenues, before the effects of hedging, to major customers (purchasers in excess of 10% of total natural gas, oil and NGL sales) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 | % of Sales
Year Ended December 31, 2020 | 
ECO-Energy | 12 | %
Year Ended December 31, 2019 | 
Morgan Stanley Capital | 14 | %
Year Ended December 31, 2018 | 
BP Energy Company | 17 | %
ECO-Energy | 10 | %

Competition 
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many other companies that have greater resources than we have. Competition can negatively impact our ability to successfully source quality vendors and service providers and our ability to secure optimal pipeline access and end markets in which to sell our production. Many of our competitors not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also have midstream and further downstream operations and market a variety of hydrocarbon products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include renewable sources such as wind or solar energy in addition to coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
Title to Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
It is customary in the oil and natural gas industry to make only a preliminary review of title to undeveloped oil and natural gas leases at the time they are acquired and to obtain more extensive title examinations when acquiring producing properties. In future acquisitions, we will conduct title examinations on material portions of such properties in a manner generally consistent with industry practice. Certain of our oil and natural gas properties may be subject to title defects, encumbrances, easements, servitudes or other restrictions, none of which, in management's opinion, will in the aggregate materially restrict our operations. 
Regulation - Environment, Health and Safety 
Exploration and Production, Environmental, Health and Safety, and Occupational Laws and Regulations

Our operations are subject to federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to matters that include, but are not limited to, the following:
Index to Financial Statements
•reporting of workplace injuries and illnesses;
•industrial hygiene monitoring;
•worker protection and workplace safety;
•approval or permits to drill and to conduct operations;
•provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations;
•calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes;
•seismic operations and data;
•location, drilling, cementing and casing of wells;
•well design and construction of pad and equipment;
•construction and operations activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species, their habitats, or sites of cultural significance;
•method of completing wells;
•hydraulic fracturing;
•water withdrawal;
•well production and operations, including processing and gathering systems;
•emergency response, contingency plans and spill prevention plans;
•air emissions and fluid discharges;
•climate change;
•use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations;
•surface usage, maintenance, monitoring and the restoration of properties associated with well pads, pipelines, impoundments and access roads;
•plugging and abandoning of wells; and
•transportation of production.
Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. These executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, fines, or criminal penalties or to injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the costs of environmental protection and of safety and health compliance to be necessary, manageable parts of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to compliance with the protection of the environment, safety and health have increased over the years and may continue to increase. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters. See the Risk Factors described in Item 1A. of this report for further discussion of governmental regulation and ongoing regulatory changes, including with respect to environmental matters.
Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In the United States, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration. Other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations often impose additional operational costs to us and can also limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal, state and/or local legislation 
Index to Financial Statements
and regulation. Further restrictions of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of natural gas, oil and NGL that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the Department of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government, tribes or tribal members. The federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding, venting and flaring, oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. In addition, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. To the extent that the review results in the development of additional restrictions on drilling, limitations on the availability of leases, or restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Permitting activities on federal lands are also subject to frequent delays.
Delays in obtaining permits or an inability to obtain new permits or permit renewals could inhibit our ability to execute our drilling and production plans. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit requirements could result in revocation of our permits, inability to obtain new permits and the imposition of fines and penalties.
Operating Hazards and Insurance 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. Our horizontal and deep drilling activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than vertical and shallow drilling operations.
We maintain a control of well insurance policy with a $25 million single well limit and a $35 million multiple wells limit that insures against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells. This insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or exposure to liability. We also carry a $51 million comprehensive general liability umbrella insurance policy. In addition, we maintain a $10 million pollution liability insurance policy providing coverage for gradual pollution related risks and in excess of the general liability policy for sudden and accidental pollution risks. We provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to employees in all states in which we operate. While we believe these policies are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks, and policy limits scale to our working interest percentage in certain situations. In addition, our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against us or may not be commercially available for purchase in the future.
We have prepared and have in place spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for each of our principal facilities in response to federal and state requirements. The plans are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. As required by applicable regulations, our facilities are built with secondary containment systems to capture potential releases. We also own additional spill kits with oil booms and absorbent pads that are readily available, if needed. In addition, we have emergency response companies on retainer. These companies specialize in the clean-up of hydrocarbons as a result of spills, blow-outs and natural disasters, and are on call to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week when their services are needed. We pay these companies a retainer plus additional amounts when they provide us with clean up services. Our aggregate payments for the retainer and clean-up services during each of 2020 and 2019 were immaterial. While these companies have been able to meet our service needs when required from time to time in the past, it is possible that the ability of one or more of them to provide services to us in the future, if and when needed, could be hindered or delayed in the event of a widespread disaster. However, in light of the areas in which we operate and the nature of our production, we believe other companies would be available to us in the event our primary remediation companies are unable to perform. We pay these companies a retainer plus additional amounts when they provide us with clean up services.

Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 256 employees, all of which are non-bargaining. The commodity downturn in late 2019 and the broader economic downturn in 2020 led to significant headcount reductions in late 2019 and 2020. Retaining, replacing and developing talent is very important as our business becomes leaner and we navigate the bankruptcy process. We recognize that even though we are a natural resource company, our most valuable assets are our people. We are passionate about devoting the time, energy and resources required to attract, motivate, retain and develop our employees. 
We understand that a workplace environment that embraces diversity and is inclusive of different ideas and perspectives is a healthy environment and one that provides the best solutions to complex challenges. While being an affirmative action employer assists us in locating qualified diversity candidates when filling positions and provides us with a metrics to reflect on how diverse we are, we have recently increased our focus on diversity across the organization including our board of directors. During 2020, our Board of Directors performed an exhaustive search as part of our board refreshment process, adding two highly qualified diversity candidates that add to the background and experience represented on our Board. Gulfport Energy Corporation’s diverse independent directors currently constitute 37.5% of the Board. The Board also reviewed and refreshed its Corporate Governance Guidelines and Diversity Principles to promote a more diverse and inclusive board and company. While 2020 was a year in which we added very few new employees, 33% of our newly hired employees were diverse hires. We also initiated a program to ensure that every employee across the company engages in peer-led, small group discussion on diversity topics. The results of these conversations will help shape initiatives in 2021, and it will also mature our diversity and inclusion practices. 
We have numerous programs to ensure that our employees and external partners are adequately trained to perform the critical work we do safely and effectively. The programs also focus on respecting the environments where we operate. We utilize in-person training sessions developed by safety experts and supplement these sessions with computer-based modules to support a safety-first mindset in everything we do. We also provide training resources to employees through universities, electronic content services and specialized courses related to our industry through our tuition reimbursement program or third-party providers. 
Safety is at the forefront of everything we do. We hold regular safety briefings prior to any significant project and routinely have safety stand-down meetings to highlight potential risks. Every employee is empowered to use their stop-work authority to cease operating if work is being performed in an unsafe manner. We monitor employee safety by establishing annual company-wide key safety metrics tied to leading indicators (i.e., incident reporting and investigations, hazard observations, safety and health meetings) and lagging indicators (i.e., injury rates, preventable motor vehicle accidents). We establish and carefully track key environmental and safety metrics that are a component of every employee’s incentive compensation opportunity for 2020.
