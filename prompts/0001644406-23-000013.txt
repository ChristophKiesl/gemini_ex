Item 1. Business
Who We Are
Hostess Brands, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries) (“We” or the “Company”) is a leading sweet snacks company focused on developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing snacks in North America primarily under the Hostess® and Voortman® brands. We produce a variety of new and classic snacks, including iconic Hostess® Donettes®, Twinkies®, CupCakes, Ding Dongs®, and Zingers®, as well as Voortman® branded cookies and wafers. Our mission is to inspire moments of joy by putting our  into everything we do. We seek to leverage our iconic brands, pricing power, impactful innovation, efficient manufacturing and distribution model, collaborative customer and strategic sourcing partnerships, and strong cash flows to drive profitable and sustained growth.
Our business operates in growing categories and snacking occasions. Our Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) products represented 21.2% of their category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 31, 2022. Our cookie and wafer products represented 2.1% of the adjacent Cookie category, providing a significant opportunity for growth. We believe our strong brand history and market position, combined with our innovative spirit and scalable operating model, provide a strong platform to execute our growth initiatives. 
We have invested significantly in retailer and consumer data analytics to identify new opportunities in the categories in which we compete. These investments, combined with our Direct-to-Warehouse (“DTW”) distribution model, support our leading brand position within the $8.5 billion U.S. SBG category and the adjacent $8.8 billion Cookie category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 31, 2022, paving a path towards future sustained, profitable growth.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses through the use of common carriers. This model has eliminated the need for direct-store delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers, which allows us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels. 
Brands and Products
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. Our extensive portfolio of timeless and universally recognized names such as Twinkies®, Ding Dongs® and Donettes® evokes an emotional affinity with consumers that has the potential to be further unlocked through effective marketing and consumer-insight based innovation. We produce cookie and creme wafer products, including sugar free varieties under our Voortman® brand, which we acquired in 2020. We also produce Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill® and Big Texas® branded products. Our classic treats target different snacking occasions and consumer needs. 
Our Growth Strategy
We execute against our growth strategy and strengthen our Hostess® and Voortman® brands by focusing on faster-growing snacking occasions through innovation, marketing, strategic sourcing partnerships and strong relationships with our customers. We leverage our highly efficient and profitable business model and productivity initiatives to maintain the momentum of our growth fly-wheel, while leveraging our strong balance sheet to pursue strategic opportunities.
 Our Business Sits in Growing Spaces
We compete in growing snacking categories. The approximate $90 billion sweet snacking universe has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% over the last three years. 
The U.S. SBG and Cookie categories combined are a significant portion of this universe, with retail sales of $17 billion according to the Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 31, 2022. Our Voortman® branded cookies and wafer products are included in the Cookie category and provide another platform to capitalize on the growing consumer snacking trends. Voortman® branded products are in the specialty cookie segment of the category and benefit from consumer demand for better-for-you ingredients. Within the SBG and Cookie categories, we are targeting large, fast growing snacking occasions. With consumers snacking to satisfy hunger, provide an emotional lift and increase social connection, we believe our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these broader snacking trends.
We believe that we have maintained the Hostess® brand equity and high awareness for over a century by satisfying consumers’ needs for great-tasting sweet treats. We have established our leadership position in the SBG category through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting brands and pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. 
We plan to capitalize on the strength of our brands and our effective retailer economics to drive market share gains by attracting new consumers within our identified consumer occasions through our continued investment in quality and wide-scale availability, meaningful innovation, targeted marketing and a focus on our most effective brands and products. Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking, evidenced by our over 90% brand awareness for Hostess®.
We continue to launch new partnerships and enter into licensing agreements that leverage our iconic brands. We have partnered with companies in various industries to bring our iconic brands and flavor profiles to complementary products, such as popcorn and ready‐to‐eat pudding. Our Voortman® branded products are sold throughout the U.S. and Canada. Both our Hostess® and Voortman® products are distributed by third parties internationally, including products packaged specifically for Mexico and the United Kingdom, among others. In addition, our products are sold on various e-commerce platforms.
We understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the traditional offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We continue to invest in new product development, building our long-term innovation pipeline and leveraging our portfolio and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion.

Best in Class Business Model
Our business model is based on the wide availability of our products and go-to-market approach, both enabled by our DTW distribution model. The DTW model uses centralized distribution and common carriers. We ship the majority of our products from a centralized distribution center in Edgerton, Kansas. Centralizing our distribution improves visibility and control of distribution and is a key component of our operating model. We utilize other smaller distribution centers focused on certain products or geographic areas. The distribution centers allow us to consolidate inventory and fill customer orders, while reducing overall inventory on-hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. The majority of our products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. 
The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. We do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain customers.
We believe our DTW distribution model allows our products to be everywhere consumers shop for snacks. It provides greater reach into convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Historically, DSD sweet baked goods companies have competed with candy and tobacco companies for distribution; however, under our DTW model, we partner with third-party distributors to profitably penetrate the convenience store, drug store and dollar store channels. In 2022, the convenience, drug and dollar channels accounted for 40.0% of our net revenue. We have established a strong presence and market share in the convenience, drug and dollar channels and are focused on continuously expanding coverage. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward. 
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of our retail sales, which makes prominent in-store placement important. The DTW and centralized distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugate displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, economically produced and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load; thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both us and the retailer. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our branded merchandising and the ability to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which our competitors predominantly serve through a DSD model.
We have a tailored channel-based go-to-market model that demonstrates key capabilities for growth. We continue to invest in data capabilities, which enable focus on store-level compliance and growth opportunities with our Hostess Partner Program (“HPP”). We also have a unique consortium retail merchandising approach where we partner with brokers to drive in-store performance at lower costs, ensuring strong shelf presence and sending a stream of retail and customer data back to our marketing and sales teams.
Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities and offers our retail partners attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We continue to invest in the business to further our strategic initiatives. Our disciplined capital investment plan focuses on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation with strong return on investment metrics. We are making targeted investments in the production capacity to enable further expansion of our fastest growing product forms. In 2022, we purchased a facility in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which will become our sixth bakery upon completion of capital investments, including new production lines. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. 
Consumer Capabilities
We leverage our consumer capabilities to drive incremental growth above the category. We strive to meet our consumers at their need states with innovative products and cultivate top-of-mind awareness through efficient digital advertising. 
Innovation is key to fueling our growth. We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing them in order to stay relevant with our consumer base and attract new consumers. We believe that to support our market position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. We are focused on continuing to innovate and expand our core products by launching new flavors of iconic products and expanding new product forms, pack-sizes and packaging to target faster growing snacking occasions and drive incremental revenue and profit. One example of our recent innovation is our Hostess® Bouncers™, which was launched in fall 2022 and provides the consumer the same iconic Hostess® cake and filling flavors in a fun, poppable, portable form targeting the lunchbox consumer snacking occasion. In 2023, we are also innovating on Voortman® branded products to improve the consumer experience by making our packaging resealable. The success of our product innovation is in part driven by deeper understanding of consumers’ snacking occasions and providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. 
We continue to increase our digital advertising to efficiently reach consumers. Our analysis shows that simply reminding consumers about Hostess® could drive incremental sales. As opposed to more traditional media, digital advertising provides us the flexibility and agility to invest in more targeted areas and demographics as we learn about the impact of our programs. This results in an efficient, high-return investment that we expect will drive continued growth.
Execute Strategic Acquisitions to Accelerate Growth
We have a solid platform for growth through acquisitions. Within the broader snacking universe, the opportunity exists to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, infrastructure and performance-driven management culture. We are committed to seeking out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The Voortman acquisition diversified and expanded our product offerings and manufacturing capabilities in the attractive, adjacent $8.8 billion Cookie category (based on Nielsen data as of December 31, 2022). The acquisition also leverages our broad customer reach and lean and agile business model. During 2020, we integrated Voortman’s distribution model into our DTW structure, with all Voortman U.S. sales shipping through our centralized distribution center. In addition to sharing established, efficient infrastructure, sales of Voortman® branded products have benefited from the strengthening of collaborative retail partnerships in the United States and Canada. 
As we explore other strategic acquisition opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage our core capabilities to reinvigorate or develop acquired brands and further expand within the wider snacking universe. We will also consider our ability to integrate acquisitions with our business and the opportunities to generate synergies through leveraging our assets and DTW model. The successful integration of Voortman exhibits our ability to execute and integrate acquisitions in adjacent categories. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to execute and integrate additional acquisitions.
Competitive Landscape
We compete in the broad snacking universe with a focus on sweet snacks within targeted consumer snacking occasions. Hostess® is the #2 brand and has the #1 cupcake and mini-donut product in the U.S. SBG category, according to Nielsen retail data as of December 31, 2022. The top three brands, Little Debbie, Hostess® and Entenmann’s account for 67% of the SBG retail sales, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration in the SBG category, consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, provide additional barriers to entry.
Voortman® has the #1 creme wafer and sugar free cookie products within the larger Cookie category in the U.S. Nabisco® is the top brand with approximately 41.4% of the overall Cookie category according to Nielsen retail data as of December 31, 2022. There is higher private label penetration in the Cookie category than the SBG category.
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators and supermarket chains with their own private label brands. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national SBG competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Grupo Bimbo, S.A., McKee Foods Corporation and Mondelez International, Inc. In addition, we also compete with regional manufacturers and other companies that produce cookies, candies and other snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products, which helps mitigate this impact.
Seasonality
SBG revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns. 
COVID-19
We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our operations in response. As discussed further below, as well as in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, we have taken and continue to take actions to respond to the disruptions caused by the pandemic and to protect the health and well-being of our entire team, their families and the communities we serve.
Production
We have an efficient, agile, resilient and scalable model that delivers quality results. Our products are primarily produced at five bakeries located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and Burlington, Ontario. In 2022, we purchased a facility in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. The facility will become our sixth bakery upon completion of capital investments to install production lines and other necessary improvements needed to make the facility operational. The facility is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our investments in state of the art baking technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The majority of our products are shipped through a centralized distribution center in Edgerton, Kansas. This facility was opened in 2020 and expanded our distribution capacity by 75% and removed two million miles from our distribution network.
With the increase in demand for our products, we continue to make adjustments to our production schedules, product assortment and equipment to maximize production capacity in our existing facilities. We are diligent in our efforts to find opportunities to reduce complexity and drive value within our supply chain. A portion of our products are manufactured and packaged by third parties under our brands and distributed through our facilities. 
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are cooking oil, sugar, coatings, flour and eggs, as well as cartons, corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for certain raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We approach sourcing with a holistic strategy to acquire the best quality ingredients and packaging materials at the lowest possible cost. We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to increase over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials for efficiency. We have multiple vendors that meet our supply requirements for the majority of our sole-sourced ingredients. With respect to the sole-sourced ingredients for which we do not have multiple vendors to meet our supply requirements, including certain enzymes used in our ESL technology, we continue to evaluate alternative sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility.
Customers
Our top ten customers in 2022 accounted for 59.4% of total net revenue. During 2022, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and related entities, represented 19.6% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2022 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with any of our top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers and distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess®, Voortman®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill®, and Big Texas® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. This provides us the opportunity to sell our products at premium price points and pursue licensing opportunities.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to the development of innovative snack products based on consumer insights and process technology. These products help address new user occasions and seek to bring new consumers into the category based on changing preferences and trends. Through the development timeline, research guidance testing to optimize attributes based on appropriate taste, flavor and texture combined with efficient cost management, helps support our growth. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to our manufacturing team to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our specifications and high standards of quality. Finally, our research and development department is charged with developing processes to optimize our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products. Our innovation lab within our Lenexa, Kansas corporate office provides us increased rapid prototyping, speed to market and small-scale batch process experimentation along with the testing capabilities, analytics and market research insights needed to support our growth objectives.
Information Technology
We rely heavily on information systems for management of our supply chain, inventory, payment of obligations, collection of cash, human capital management, financial tools and other business processes and procedures. Our ability to manage our business functions efficiently and effectively depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. We have instituted controls, including information technology governance controls that are intended to protect our computer systems and our information technology systems and networks. We also have business continuity plans that attempt to anticipate and mitigate failures. However, we cannot control or prevent every potential technology failure, adverse environmental event, third-party service interruption or cybersecurity risk.
We increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding customer, consumer or employee information on our behalf.
Except for limited information related to the usage of our websites, location data, or voluntarily submitted by users of our websites or others to our Consumer Affairs Team, we typically do not collect or store consumer data or personal information. However, third-party providers, including our licensees, co-manufacturers, e-commerce contractors and third-party sellers may do so. The website operations of such third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted, telecommunications failures, data security breaches and similar disruptions.
Corporate Sustainability
We published our second Corporate Responsibility Report (“CRR”) in May 2022, identifying four key areas of focus for the Company - Environment, Governance, Health and Safety, and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging. We strive to be a responsible, caring member of the communities in which we operate by focusing on our environmental impact and community involvement. Some examples of this are our product and monetary donations and employee volunteer activities. 
Environment
At Hostess Brands, we understand the need to manage our environmental resources in a sustainable manner, which is why we are committed to the responsible sourcing of packaging and ingredients, as well as water and energy conservation. We are emphasizing a “sustainability-first” approach as we design our next bakery in Arkansas and are developing a climate action plan with the assistance of a third-party specialist which we expect to complete during 2023.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and Health Canada for our Canadian operations. Our products are subject to various local, state or provincial, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, ingredient standards, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMPs”), food traceability, hazard analysis and risk-based preventative controls, food labeling and advertising, hazard reporting and recall requirements, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. We take compliance and the safety of our products and employees seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,800 people. Of our total workforce, approximately 90% were located at our bakeries. The remaining workers comprised functions including operations management, sales and supply chain, among other corporate functions.
Our employees are critical to our success and allow us to continue to bring joy to our consumers and customers.
Health & Safety
Safety remains our top priority, and we are proud to have achieved the best total safety record in our over nine-year history during 2022. We have improved our total safety record five years running, with 2022 results for key metrics scoring best in class for categories consistent with Occupational Safety and Heath Administration (“OSHA”) standards. For the full year, we achieved a Total Incident Rate (“TIR”) of 1.08 vs. Commercial Bakery average of 4.23. We develop and maintain safety policies in our facilities and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance. 
Labor
Our ability to achieve sustained, profitable results is predicated on our ability to attract, retain, and engage a team of employees aligned to our common purpose to deliver products that create moments of joy for our customers and consumers. We are committed to providing a safe work environment, competitive wage and benefits packages, career development and training opportunities to produce a more stable, informed and fulfilled workforce, and an inclusive culture that encourages each employee to bring their whole self to work. 
There were continued labor challenges across the U.S. during 2022, and while this issue impacted us like virtually all employers, we have worked closely with our employees to ensure we can deliver on the promise of our Mission, Vision, and Values in serving our customers and consumers. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union in Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Georgia and Burlington, Ontario; and AFL-CIO and the Chemical Production Workers Union Local No. 30 in Chicago, Illinois. Approximately 1,200 employees are covered by these collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to be good and have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
3 Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, Commercial Bakeries
We agreed to four-year contracts in our Burlington, Ontario and Columbus, Georgia locations in March and December 2022, respectively, and a three-year contract for our Indianapolis bakery in January 2022. 
We offer competitive wages and benefits, including medical, dental, vision, paid family leave, paid time off, 401(k) plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and a number of other programs to best suit the needs of our employees. Beginning in 2023, we enhanced our 401(k) plan by increasing the employer match by 1% and converting to a safe harbor plan.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging
To best achieve our desired results, it is vital that employees are comfortable bringing their whole selves to work. We believe diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging efforts are key to maintaining our positive culture. In addition to training and education at all levels, in 2022 we continued to develop our enterprise-wide DEI&B Team, which identifies opportunities to improve our culture, including the planning and execution of celebration and appreciation events for a variety of groups, including the continuation of a Speaker Series, programming around culture and appreciation events, and review and enhancement of our diversity policies and practices. Specifically, we sponsored celebrations of diversity and heritage events promoting MLK Day, Hispanic, Women’s History and LGBTQ Pride Months, among others. We also have developed employee resource groups (“ERG”) based on the interest of employees, including our Veteran’s ERG established in 2022 and our Women’s ERG established in the first quarter of 2023.

Culture & Engagement
The Company’s culture is an integral part of our strategy, built on creativity, commitment, collaboration, positive energy, and strong sense of ownership. We launched our Mission, Vision, and Values in May 2021 to ensure everyone on our team understands the purpose of our work. Our Mission: We inspire moments of joy by putting our  into everything we do. Our Vision: We envision a world where the everyday is worth celebrating. 
As a Company, we strive to achieve each of our six values every day:
•People: We rise together because every member of our diverse team has ownership and common purpose. Our team members are the heart of Hostess.
•Nimbleness: We overcome challenges and take advantage of opportunities by being quick to assess, decide and act.
•Integrity: We hold ourselves accountable to do the right thing for all stakeholders. Trust is the key ingredient to our recipe for successful relationships and reputation.
•Tenacity: We depend on our resilience and resolve to achieve the ambitious goals we set.
•Inclusivity: We are inclusive of ideas, individuals, and differing points of view. Everyone’s contributions are necessary for us to succeed.
•Quality: We do what it takes to deliver a great experience, from the quality of our products to a day in the life of our team members.
To better understand the full experience of our employees, to hear what they value, and what they believe could be improved, in May 2022, we conducted a Pulse of Hostess Brands engagement survey across our full employee base. As a result of this process and other activities, we are engaged in action planning to make our work environment even better. Using both live roundtable sessions with small groups of employees and virtual sessions with executive leadership, we regularly check in with our employees to identify issues needing attention, while sharing key messages with all employees through quarterly Town Hall meetings. In 2022, we also continued the Heart of Hostess and Hostess Hero awards, employee honors that recognize leadership and character.
To further demonstrate our commitment to our employees and increase belonging, we entered into a partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) during 2022. We are engaging in NAMI’s StigmaFree workplace program, which seeks to provide support and resources both in the workplace and in communities where Hostess operates. 
Embodying our mission, vision and values is a strong and experienced management team, led by Andy Callahan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Members of the management team have extensive experience in the consumer packaged goods industry across the sales, operations, marketing, human resources, legal, and finance disciplines.
Our management team is complemented by an experienced Board of Directors, all of whom have senior executive leadership experience and bring with them extensive consumer products knowledge. Our board members and management include:
