ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Overview
We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing innovative tissue reinforcement materials to address unmet needs in soft tissue reconstruction. We are committed to providing patients with advanced, economically effective biologic material repair solutions to patients to minimize long-term exposure to permanent synthetic materials and improve clinical outcomes. Our products are purposefully designed to address the shortcomings of existing reinforcement materials in hernia repair, abdominal wall reconstruction and plastic and reconstructive surgery.
Our first portfolio of products, the OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix (“OviTex”), addresses unmet needs in hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction by combining the benefits of biologic matrices and polymer materials while minimizing their shortcomings, at a cost-effective price. Our OviTex products have received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) which clearance was obtained and is currently held by Aroa, our exclusive manufacturer and supplier. Interim results of our ongoing prospective, single arm, multicenter post-market clinical study, which we refer to as our BRAVO study, suggest that OviTex is safe and clinically effective for the treatment of ventral hernias. Our BRAVO study was fully enrolled at 92 patients. The interim analysis includes patient cohorts at the 90-day, 12-month and 24-month follow-up periods. At 90 days post-operative, there were no recurrences or reoperations among the 84 patients analyzed and one implant removal due to a bowel perforation. The final 12-month analysis includes 76 patients, of whom two patients experienced a recurrence, both adjacent to the original repair, with the OviTex repairs remaining intact. Of the 51 patients that have reached 24-month follow-up, one patient experienced a surgical site occurrence from a superficial infection and none experienced a recurrence or long-term complication. Additional results from the 30-day and 24-month patient cohorts showing low rates of surgical site occurrences requiring treatment were presented in September 2020 at the Americas Hernia Society Annual Meeting. Our second portfolio of products, the OviTex PRS Reinforced Tissue Matrix (“OviTex PRS”), addresses unmet needs in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In April 2019, our OviTex PRS products received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained by Aroa and is currently held by us.
​
We began commercialization of our OviTex products in the U.S. in July 2016, and they are now used in more than 325 hospitals. Hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S., representing approximately 1.2 million procedures annually. Our OviTex portfolio consists of multiple products that can be used for ventral hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction, inguinal hernia repair and hiatal hernia repair. In addition, to address the significant increase in the number of robotic-assisted hernia repairs over the last several years, we have designed an OviTex product specifically for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery called OviTex LPR, which we began commercializing in November 2018. We subsequently expanded the OviTex LPR product line in December 2019.
OviTex PRS is indicated for use in implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our OviTex PRS portfolio is supported by non-human primate data that demonstrated more rapid tissue integration and tissue remodeling compared to the market leading biologic matrix used in this indication. The current annual market for biologic matrices used for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the U.S. is approximately $500 million. We commenced a limited launch in May 2019 and have gathered clinical feedback from our initial surgeon users. Based on this feedback, we expanded our commercial launch in June 2020 and expect to continue to expand our surgeon network. We will also evaluate new generation products. We also intend to engage in discussions with the FDA regarding an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) protocol to study the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS product for an indication in breast reconstruction surgery. The FDA has stated that a PMA, rather than 510(k) clearance will be required for such an indication.
We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property protecting our products, which we believe, when combined with our proprietary manufacturing processes and know-how, provides significant barriers to entry. Our intellectual property applies to our differentiated product construction and materials. In addition, we believe our exclusive manufacturing and long-term supply and license agreement (the “Aroa License”) with Aroa creates a competitive advantage by allowing us 

7



to secure an exclusive supply of ovine rumen at a low cost. Ovine rumen, the forestomach of a sheep, is the source of the biologic material used in our products. In manufacturing the product, we use biologic material from ovine rumen because of its plentiful supply, optimal biomechanical profile and open collagen architecture that allows for rapid cellular infiltration. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed cost equal to 27% of our net sales of licensed products.
We market our products through a single direct sales force, predominantly in the U.S. We have invested in our direct sales and marketing infrastructure in order to expand our presence and to promote awareness and adoption of our products. As of December 31, 2020, we had 45 sales territories in the U.S. As part of our commercial strategy, we plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by hiring additional account managers, clinical development specialists and administrative support staff in order to support and service new accounts for soft tissue reconstruction procedures. We believe we can enhance the productivity of our sales force by improving customer segmentation and targeting, leveraging digital channels to engage customers and utilizing engagement analytics to support development. We plan to continue to contract with GPOs and IDNs to increase access to and penetration of hospital accounts. We will adjust our commercial expansion plan, as appropriate, as we continue to better understand the effects of the pandemic resulting from COVID-19 on our sales and marketing efforts.
Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We began to see an adverse impact on the number of surgical procedures using our OviTex products in the second half of March 2020. Since mid-April 2020, the number of procedures using our products and our corresponding sales have increased in a gradual, non-linear fashion. While our procedural volumes improved relative to the second quarter of 2020, we are continuing to be impacted by postponements in non-emergent procedures in areas of the country where COVID-19 infections are rising, however, at a less drastic pace than the second quarter of 2020. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $18.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively, which represents an increase of $2.8 million, or 18%. Our net loss for the same time periods was $28.8 million and $22.4 million, respectively, which represents an increase of $6.4 million, or 28%. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $196.7 million. The vast majority of our revenue to date has been generated from sales of our OviTex products in the U.S., with the remainder generated from sales of our OviTex products in Europe, and sales of our OviTex PRS products in the U.S.
In November 2019, we closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 4,398,700 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share, including 398,700 shares of our common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of $50.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. In June 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $44.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “TELA.”

Hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S. There are an estimated 1.2 million hernia repairs annually in the U.S. including recurrences, which we categorize as approximately (i) 65,000 complex/moderate ventral hernia repairs and abdominal wall reconstructions, (ii) 362,000 simple ventral hernia repairs and (iii) 789,900 inguinal hernia repairs. We estimate that there are approximately 44,400 hiatal hernia repairs annually in the U.S. Approximately 90% of all hernia repairs are treated with a tissue reinforcement material.
The healthcare burden of hernia disease to patients, insurers and employers is significant. For the patient, a hernia may cause an increasing level of pain when lifting, straining during urination or a bowel movement, or sitting or standing for long periods of time. Increased pain from the hernia is the most common reason that a patient who is deferring surgical hernia repair will ultimately elect repair surgery. Following surgical hernia repair, convalescence has a significant socioeconomic impact. Absence from work during this period can range from approximately five to 14 days according to one study. Pain is the most common cause of delay in returning to work, followed by wound problems. Long-term pain 

8



or discomfort at the hernia repair site is one of the most serious complications of hernia surgery and may, in some cases, persist for years.
In addition, for third-party payors, the costs related to hernia are significant. The number of annual physician office visits in the U.S. related to hernia were approximately 2.5 million in 2016 according to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction inpatient per procedure costs in the U.S. ranged from approximately $6,117 to $29,615 in 2018 according to the national average Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (“MS-DRG”) rate which does not account for surgeon fees involved with such procedures. Hernias are prone to recurrence, which often require multiple repair procedures and additional healthcare expenditures. In the U.S., the economic burden of hernia repair accounts for approximately $48.0 billion of healthcare expenditures annually.
Given the limitations of and lack of innovation in existing hernia repair products, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for our portfolio of OviTex products. Based on the volume weighted average selling price of our OviTex products, we estimate the annual U.S. total addressable market opportunity for our OviTex products to be approximately $1.5 billion.

Modern advances in tissue engineering have transformed the plastic and reconstructive surgeon’s management strategies across a wide variety of applications. Because biologic matrices incorporate into host tissues and enable revascularization and functional tissue remodeling, surgeons have realized multiple applications for their use, with techniques tailored to the specific requirements of the surgery. There is growing clinical literature validating the use of biologic matrices in head and neck surgery and reconstructions of the chest wall, pelvic region, extremities and breast.
In head and neck surgery, biologic matrices are used for both aesthetic and reconstructive purposes that include: surgery of the nose to change its shape or improve its function, referred to as rhinoplasty; lip augmentation; repair of perforations of the cartilage and thin bone separating the nostrils referred to as the nasal septum; complex reconstruction of the oral and oropharynx cavities after oncologic resection; cleft palate repair; upper and lower eyelid reconstruction; scalp defects and defects of the fibrous membrane covering the brain and spinal cord referred to as dura. In chest wall reconstruction, biologic matrices are used to repair defects from oncologic resections. In pelvic reconstruction, biologic matrices are utilized as an adjunct in the reconstruction of acquired pelvic defects caused by resections for colorectal, gynecologic and urologic malignancies. In extremities reconstruction, biologic matrices are used in the upper extremity for repair of the donor site following the harvest of a radial forearm free flap, a procedure used to harvest tissue and replace it in the head and neck after cancer has been resected. In breast reconstruction, biologic matrices are utilized for prosthetic based reconstruction following the removal of cancerous breast tissue.
Breast reconstructions can be performed either using a sub-pectoral or pre-pectoral technique. In a sub-pectoral technique, the upper portion of the breast implant is placed below the pectoralis muscle and a biologic matrix is placed around the lower portion of the breast implant. In a pre-pectoral technique, the entire breast implant is placed above the 

9



pectoralis muscle and the full top surface of the breast implant is covered. The pre-pectoral technique utilizes a larger biologic matrix compared to that needed with the sub-pectoral technique. For patients who undergo autologous reconstruction, the donor site of the autologous tissue, typically the abdomen, may require soft tissue reinforcement.
Based on the current sales of biologic matrices in the U.S., we estimate the annual U.S. current addressable market opportunity for our OviTex PRS products to be approximately $500 million. This market continues to grow as surgeon and patient preferences shift from sub-pectoral to pre-pectoral techniques.
Given the limitations of and lack of innovation in existing biologic matrices for plastic and reconstructive surgical procedures, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for our OviTex PRS portfolio products.
Current Materials Used in Hernia Repair and Abdominal Wall Reconstruction and Their Limitations
Hernia Repair and Abdominal Wall Reconstruction
The vast majority of hernias are treated with surgical repair. Surgical hernia repair is performed either through open repair, which uses a single incision to open the abdomen or groin across the hernia, or minimally invasive repair, which involves laparoscopic or robotic-assisted techniques. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique performed in the abdomen or groin through small incisions. Surgical instruments and devices, such as mesh products, are then delivered to the surgical site through a trocar, which is an access port to the patient’s abdomen or groin. Robotic-assisted surgery is also performed using small incisions in the patient’s abdomen or groin and a trocar, but the surgeon sits at a console in the operating room and operates the robotic instruments remotely.
At the advent of hernia repair, all procedures were performed using an open surgical technique in which an incision is made through the body to access and repair the hernia. Due to the amount of healthy soft tissue disruption required for an open procedure, there is a high risk of wound-related complications and seroma formation. In the early 1990s, surgeons began using a laparoscopic approach for hernia repair because it provided the benefits of lower wound complication rates, lower patient morbidity and decreased length of stay for patients. Despite these benefits, laparoscopic surgery presents surgeons with challenges, primarily due to restricted instrument dexterity that makes it difficult to achieve primary closure of the hernia defect, in which the connective tissue layer is sutured close, and leads to a bridged repair. In a bridged repair, the tissue reinforcement material spans a portion of the hernia defect without any connective tissue layer above it to provide additional reinforcement. This leads to increased risk of bulging of the material or hernia recurrence. Robotic-assisted hernia repair addresses this issue while still providing the benefits of a laparoscopic repair. In robotic-assisted repair, the surgeon enjoys greater instrument dexterity and precision, and is able to achieve primary closure of the hernia defect. This has contributed to a significant increase in the number of robotic-assisted hernia repair over the last several years.
It is estimated that about 90% of hernia repairs today use a form of reconstruction material to provide long-term support at the repair site. Reconstruction materials include synthetic mesh, which can be either permanent or resorbable, and biologic matrices made from tissue material.
In October 2020, we surveyed a group of 71 surgeons to better understand their receptivity to nature repair solutions, their technique preferences across their hernia practice and their views on the risks associated with plastic mesh. Feedback was gathered across inguinal hernia, simple ventral, moderate-to-complex ventral and hiatal hernia repair. Included in the group were 43 general surgeons (61%), 19 plastic reconstructive surgeons (27%) and the remainder were colorectal and trauma surgeons. These surgeons indicated they believe there is a role for natural repair products across all hernia segments, and expect to increase their usage of those products in the next 24-months. Almost 60% of surgeons stated that they are aware of the risks associated with plastic mesh and reported approximately 20% of their hernia patients have voiced concern about the use of plastic mesh within the past 12-months.
Permanent Synthetic Mesh
Permanent synthetic mesh, the oldest category of hernia repair materials, is made of plastic materials that are also used in industrial and consumer products. These products have gained popularity with surgeons because they are relatively inert, 

10



can be readily sterilized, exhibit biomechanical strength and durability and are available at relatively low upfront cost. Limitations of permanent synthetic mesh products may include:

● | significant persistent foreign body inflammatory response that can result in encapsulation of the implant by fibrotic tissue or contraction of the mesh;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | chronic post-operative pain;
--+-----------------------------


● | scar tissue formation and lack of regeneration of soft tissue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | permanent susceptibility to mesh infection;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | significant cost associated with subsequent repairs or failed and infected mesh;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compromised abdominal wall anatomy due to damaged and eroded tissue rendering subsequent surgical repairs challenging; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | migration of the permanent synthetic mesh which can result in organ erosion or perforation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these complications caused by permanent synthetic mesh require additional surgical intervention, including, explantation of the mesh or repair of hernia recurrence or the abdominal wall. Based on longitudinal data from the Danish Hernia Database, in an analysis of approximately 2,900 patients who received a hernia repair using a permanent synthetic mesh, the observed rate of surgical intervention due to either recurrence or mesh-related complications at five years post operatively was approximately 17%. As a result of these complications and litigation involving these complications, the number of adverse events reported to the FDA for permanent synthetic mesh hernia repairs has risen from 1,484 in 2016, 3,220 in 2017, 9,887 in 2018 to 18,072 in 2019. Synthetic mesh products have been the subject of an increasing number of lawsuits with over 13,000 cases filed in the state of Rhode Island alone.
Biologic Matrices
The complications associated with permanent synthetic mesh prompted the development of biologic matrices as a second category of hernia repair materials. Biologic matrices are derived from human or animal dermis, pericardium or intestinal submucosa, which allows them to become replaced entirely by the patient’s own tissue over time, a process known as remodeling. The goal behind these biologic materials was to lower the foreign body inflammatory response and biomechanical requirements of the repair, while providing a matrix upon which tissue remodeling could occur. Compared to permanent synthetic mesh, biologic matrices are less likely to induce this inflammatory response and become infected; however, they may have the following limitations:

● | lack strength or durability as compared to synthetic mesh products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prone to laxity and stretching;
--+--------------------------------


● | difficult to handle, leading to longer operating times as compared to synthetic mesh products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inability to be placed in a patient through a trocar in laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | considerably more expensive upfront costs than permanent synthetic mesh, typically limiting their use to complex hernia repairs or abdominal wall reconstructions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Though hernia recurrence occurs with the use of all types of soft tissue reconstruction, biologic matrices have the highest rates of recurrence, in part as a result of being commonly used in complex hernia repairs or abdominal wall reconstructions. The RICH study, a multicenter, prospective study sponsored by LifeCell Corporation (“LifeCell”) that evaluated the performance of Strattice, the current market-leading biologic matrix, in open ventral incisional hernia 

11



repair in contaminated abdominal wall defects, demonstrated post-operative hernia recurrence rates of 19% and 28% at 12-months and 24-months follow-up, respectively.
Resorbable Synthetic Mesh
Resorbable synthetic mesh was introduced as a third category of hernia repair materials and as an alternative to permanent synthetic mesh and biologic matrices. Resorbable synthetic mesh was designed with the intended benefits of full degradation over several months, a moderately lower cost than biologic matrices and gradual transfer of strength from synthetic mesh to native tissue over time. Resorbable synthetic mesh is polymer-based and does not include biologic material to promote tissue remodeling and healing. Despite improvements compared to the use of permanent synthetic mesh or biologic matrices, limitations of resorbable synthetic mesh may include:

● | significant foreign body inflammatory response that can result in encapsulation or contraction of the mesh until resorbed;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | scar tissue formation and lack of remodeling of soft tissue;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | mesh infection until resorbed;
--+-------------------------------


● | migration of the mesh until resorbed which can result in organ erosion or perforation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lack of mid-term and long-term soft tissue reinforcement as resorption progresses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these complications can require additional surgical intervention including explantation of the resorbable synthetic mesh or repair of hernia recurrence or the abdominal wall. Data from a recently published, multicenter, prospective study sponsored by C.R. Bard, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company) that evaluated the performance of Phasix, the current market-leading resorbable synthetic mesh, in CDC Class I, high risk ventral and incisional hernia repair, showed a post-operative hernia recurrence rate of 9% at 18-months follow-up and 18% at 36-month follow-up.
Current Materials Used in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Their Limitations
Biologic matrices are most commonly used in plastic and reconstructive surgery, including surgery of the nose to change its shape or improve its function, referred to as rhinoplasty, lip augmentation, repair of perforations of cartilage and thin bone separating the nostrils, complex reconstruction of the oral and oropharynx cavities after oncologic resection, cleft palate repair, upper and lower eyelid reconstruction, scalp defects, and defects of the fibrous membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, called the dura, because of their ability to define shape and position, improve tissue quality, reinforce existing soft tissue and reduce the rate of complications associated with a foreign body inflammatory response, however they are prone to excessive stretching over time and difficult for surgeons to handle. These limitations may lead to undesirable results requiring additional surgical intervention. Additionally, biologic matrices are typically expensive to source.
Our Solution
We have created a new category of tissue reinforcement materials that were purposefully designed in close collaboration with more than 100 surgeons to address the unmet clinical needs in soft tissue reconstruction. Our portfolio of products, designed with over 95% biologic material, combines the benefits of both biologic and polymer materials while addressing their limitations by interweaving polymer fibers through layers of a minimally-processed biologic material. These products are priced competitively, and designed for use with a range of surgical techniques, allowing the benefits of an advanced biologic repair to be available to more patients for use in accordance with the 510(k) clearances and the instructions for use.

The biologic material serves as the natural building block from which we can fabricate devices that meet specific clinical and surgical handling requirements. This material consists of an intact, minimally-processed extracellular matrix derived from ovine rumen, which is the forestomach of a sheep. Polymer fibers are interwoven through the layers of biologic material in unique embroidered patterns and contribute to less than 5% of the overall device by mass. The interwoven polymer utilized can be either permanent, made from polypropylene, or resorbable, made from polyglycolic acid (“PGA”). The embroidering pattern varies between our OviTex and OviTex PRS portfolios to impart different biomechanical properties tailored for their respective intended clinical applications. Our OviTex products are designed with a lockstitch embroidery pattern that is sewn in a grid pattern to create a ripstop effect and minimize stretch. Our OviTex PRS products are designed with a patented corner-lock stitch pattern designed to resist deformation and to control the degree and direction of stretching of the product.
Our capabilities in polymer science, biologics, textile engineering and analytical testing enable us to quickly design, manufacture and develop innovative products. These competencies also allow our technical team to tailor the degree of stretch, direction of stretch, overall strength, handling properties, permeability, thickness, texture, size and shape of each reinforced tissue matrix to suit the needs of particular clinical applications and surgical techniques. This expertise has been utilized in the development of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and is currently being leveraged in the development of our pipeline products.
Our reinforced tissue matrices are designed to improve the outcomes of soft tissue reconstructions by reinforcing tissue while allowing rapid tissue integration, revascularization and biomechanical control. In addition to overall strength, a key property that we engineer into our products is the degree to which they stretch, known as compliance. Each of our products is designed to exhibit a degree of compliance appropriate for its intended clinical application.
The graphics below illustrate the key features of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products:

OviTex PRS
We believe the principal benefits of our reinforced tissue matrices are:

● | Reduced foreign body inflammatory response. The biologic material utilized in our reinforced tissue matrices acts to reduce the body’s inflammatory response to the device. Our unique embroidered patterns create a macroporous grid within the biologic material. The biologic material largely surrounds the polymer and helps attenuate and localize inflammation to zones immediately surrounding the polymer. In our non-human primate comparative study in which we compared our OviTex products to several commercially available synthetic mesh and biologic matrix products, our OviTex products demonstrated a minimal foreign body inflammatory response, similar to biologic matrices, and less foreign body inflammatory response than all of the synthetic mesh tested at 24 weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced remodeling of soft tissue and rate of healing. Our reinforced tissue matrices are constructed to provide increased surface area and permeability, allowing for rapid absorption of wound fluids and blood during implantation and enabling improved supply of oxygen, cellular infiltration, migration, and repopulation for revascularization and functional tissue remodeling during healing. In our non-human primate comparative study, at 24 weeks the pattern of collagen formation in our OviTex products was reminiscent of connective tissue as opposed to the random fibers typical of scar tissue that were seen adjacent to the synthetic mesh. By contrast, the synthetic mesh showed no signs of remodeling of soft tissue and exhibited a high level of mesh contraction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to tolerate a contaminated wound environment. Our reinforced tissue matrices are engineered to create hundreds of micro-channels to promote fluid exchange to allow host cells and new blood vessels to penetrate the reinforced tissue matrix. In our non-human primate comparative study, at four weeks our OviTex products had host cells between and within the layers of the reinforced tissue matrix. We believe this early cell infiltration may reduce the potential for bacterial colonization and the risk for infection, although we have not conducted comparative studies in humans.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly engineered biomechanical properties with durability of results. Our reinforced tissue matrices are reinforced with interwoven polymer fibers to provide mid-term and long-term strength. The interwoven polymer increases the strength of our OviTex products by approximately 25% compared to the biologic material alone. When tensile forces are applied, this design allows for load sharing between the biologic material and the polymer during the remodeling process. Data from our strength testing demonstrated that our OviTex products meet or exceed that of published data from market-leading permanent and resorbable synthetic mesh. In our BRAVO study, there were two hernia recurrences in the 76 patients who reached
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14




one year follow-up, despite approximately 85% of these patients having one or more factors known to increase the risk of recurrence. Based on this data, we believe that this 2.6% recurrence rate is the lowest reported rate in any prospective study that includes either our biologic or resorbable synthetic mesh competitors. The addition of polymer to our reinforced tissue matrices allows each product to maintain its physiologic compliance properties, while resisting stretching and elongation. In our non-human primate comparative study, our OviTex devices best preserved their original shape, experiencing less contraction compared to biologic and synthetic mesh.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced surgeon handling and satisfaction. Each of our embroidery patterns was designed specifically to allow the surgeon to trim and shape the product without the polymer unraveling. In addition, based upon our survey of approximately 50 surgeons, our OviTex products conform readily to the contours of surgical sites and are easy to handle, trim, suture and tack in all surgical approaches. In interim data presented from our BRAVO study, of 26 subjects who received minimally invasive surgery, 100% of the surgeons who operated on those subjects cited the product as being easy to place and the average surgeon satisfaction with the product was 9.7/10 at both 30 and 90 days. In addition, we have designed OviTex LPR for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower upfront cost products. Our reinforced tissue matrices provide our customers with meaningful cost savings over leading competitive products across a range of clinical uses so that more patients can experience the benefits of an advanced biologic repair solution. We price our OviTex products competitively, and on average, our customers realize 20% to 40% cost savings over leading biologic matrices and resorbable synthetic mesh. Our OviTex PRS portfolio is priced below leading biologic matrices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths
We are focused on developing and commercializing a new category of tissue reinforcement materials for surgeons and patients that aim to address the shortcomings of existing products. We believe the following strengths will allow us to build our business and potentially increase our market penetration:

● | Innovative and broad portfolio of products. Our OviTex and OviTex PRS products are the only FDA-cleared products to incorporate polymer fibers interwoven through layers of biologic material in a lockstitch pattern creating an embroidered construction. The biologic matrix is derived from ovine rumen and utilizes a patented process to create a reinforced tissue matrix that is optimized for soft tissue reconstruction. Our OviTex and OviTex PRS products are available in resorbable and permanent polymer versions in a variety of configurations and sizes. For example, our OviTex devices are currently available in sizes ranging from 4 × 8 cm to 25 × 40 cm, and our OviTex LPR devices are designed with specific thickness, handling properties and shapes optimized for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruptive technology supported by compelling clinical evidence. The safety, efficacy and durability of our OviTex products are supported by compelling clinical evidence that includes studies in more than 200 non-human primates, and our BRAVO study. Our non-human primate data demonstrated that use of our OviTex products resulted in more rapid tissue integration and revascularization compared to biologic matrices and lower inflammatory response and better functional tissue remodeling compared to permanent and resorbable synthetic mesh.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-term supply agreement that provides pricing flexibility. Our Aroa License provides for the exclusive supply of ovine rumen and manufacture of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products, which gives us a low and fixed cost of raw materials. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed cost equal to 27% of our net sales of licensed products.

● | Established reimbursement pathway for hernia repair. The implantation of biologic matrices and synthetic mesh for hernia repair is coded using an established fixed procedure payment system known as a MS-DRG that consists of a lump sum payment rate that varies based on the degree of complications and comorbidities of each hernia. In addition, surgeons receive payment for their services depending on the coding associated with the procedure. The MS-DRG-based reimbursement system encourages hospitals to become more efficient in treating patients due to its fixed per-patient reimbursement nature.

● | Broad intellectual property portfolio. Our products are covered by intellectual property that broadly covers changing a biologic matrix’s biomechanical properties by interweaving a polymer thread through the biologic matrix. Specifically, our patents claim the ability to tailor stretch resistance. The ability to predictably control the biomechanical properties of a biologic matrix is the cornerstone of our product portfolio. Our intellectual property also covers the development of extracellular matrix scaffolds derived from ovine rumen, methods for isolating these scaffolds from ovine rumen, layering multiple sheets of these ovine rumen scaffolds together, sewing in an anti-adhesive layer into a scaffold, and adding unique patterns sewn or embroidered into these scaffolds using different polymers to impart reinforcing strength. Through the Aroa License and our issued or allowed patents and patent applications, we have a broad portfolio of intellectual property that is leveraged in all of our reinforced tissue matrix products. In addition, we believe that the trade secrets developed with Aroa create additional barriers to entry.

Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading provider of soft tissue reconstruction products. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Expand our U.S. commercial organization to support our growth. We sell our products through a single direct sales organization in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had 45 sales territories in the U.S. and approximately 325 active hospital accounts, which are supported by 64 employees in our U.S. based commercial organization. We plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by adding account managers, clinical development specialists and administrative support staff in order to support and service new accounts for soft tissue reconstruction procedures. We believe we can also enhance the productivity of our sales force by improving customer segmentation and targeting, leveraging digital channels to engage customers and utilize engagement analytics to support development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promote awareness of our products to drive surgeon use. We educate surgeons regarding the value proposition of our products through presentations and exhibits at industry conferences, medical education symposia, direct training and education, webinars and publishing additional clinical data demonstrating the benefits of our products and establishing online peer-to-peer communities. In response to the restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a virtual marketing sales solution as well. Most of
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

our sales professionals have used this solution, which includes virtual sales calls with physicians, peer-to-peer discussions with key opinion leaders, physician webinars and sales professional training, instead of in-person sales and marketing programs. We plan to continue to drive awareness of our products through these programs and continue to compliment the in-person visits with our virtual programs, while expanding their geographic reach and increasing the number of surgeon interactions. We will continue to increase our digital marketing efforts as well to build brand awareness with event marketing engagement, targeted ads and emails, various social media efforts and patient education and outreach efforts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive utilization through existing GPO and IDN contracts and secure additional contracts. We are focused on partnering with our existing GPO- and IDN-contracted customers to promote implementation of our contracts, increase our access to surgeon customers, broaden awareness of products and help drive utilization of our products within associated hospitals and healthcare systems. In addition, we continue to pursue contracts with additional GPOs and IDNs. GPO and IDN contracts enable greater access to geographies with high procedural volumes and provide prioritized status within hospital procurement systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build upon clinical evidence of the effectiveness and safety of our products. We are committed to evidence-based medicine and investing in clinical data to support the use of our products. We submitted our complete 12-month follow-up data from our BRAVO study in March 2021, and expect the complete study results by the end of 2021. In addition, we are tracking the health economic outcomes within our BRAVO study. We are in the process of starting the next post-market study of our OviTex products in robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair surgeries in early 2021. We also intend to support independent investigator-led post-market clinical studies on the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex PRS products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our portfolio of reinforced tissue matrices with the introduction of new product features and designs. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings and the treatment capabilities of our products to address a broader patient base within soft tissue reconstruction. As we innovate and develop our products, the new features and improved surgical techniques expand the clinical applications for soft tissue reinforcement. Areas of focus include enhanced surgical handling, increased permeability, and longer-acting resorbable polymers. Improving the surgical handling and implementation of our devices benefits both the clinician and patient. Increasing product permeability encourages a more-natural healing response. Longer-acting polymers can provide additional support for patients that need more time to heal. We believe these technology enhancements will continue to bolster our portfolio and expand the successful use of our products.

Our Products
Our Technology Platform
Our advanced reinforced tissue matrix technology consists of multiple layers of minimally-processed, acellular extracellular matrix derived from ovine rumen with interwoven polymer fibers in a unique embroidered pattern. The extracellular matrix is the collagen component of the rumen that is retained following removal of the epithelium, muscle and cellular content, and has an optimal biomechanical profile and open collagen architecture that allows for rapid cellular infiltration. These thin, strong layers of ovine rumen are plentiful in supply and serve as building blocks from which we can construct multilayered devices to customize products to adapt to clinical needs and surgeon preferences. The layers of extracellular matrix provide a high degree of surface area for tissue remodeling. We strengthen these reinforced tissue matrix layers with interwoven polymers, that are either permanent, polypropylene, or resorbable, PGA. These polymers were selected because they are well characterized suture materials with a history of significant clinical use and recognized safety profile. Polypropylene has a high tensile strength and a low inflammatory response in small quantities. PGA is the fastest resorbing polymer and within three months it tends to be fully absorbed into the body.
Our highly specialized and customizable textile engineering capability allows us to tailor the degree and direction of stretch, overall strength, handling properties, permeability, thickness, texture, size and shape of each reinforced tissue

matrix to suit the needs of particular clinical applications and surgical techniques. Our textile engineering utilizes a computer-controlled fabrication method that is scalable, reproducible, efficient and customizable. This embroidery process uses steel gauge needles to interweave the polymer while also creating hundreds of micro-channels to allow the multi-directional passage of the patients’ native cells and fluids throughout the product. The interwoven polymers are embroidered using a lockstitch pattern, which allows for the device to be trimmed without fraying, and we can use a patented corner-lock pattern, which creates a stable polymer fabric within the biologic material. We manipulate the polymer thread patterns to control the degree and stretch of our products. Denser grid patterns increase the amount of reinforcement and less dense patterns of different geometry allow for greater stretch. We are also able to manufacture products with smooth external layers that minimize the amount of exposed polymer to allow for direct contact with patients’ internal organs.
OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix
Our OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained and is currently held by Aroa, and is intended for use as a surgical mesh to reinforce and/or repair soft tissue where weakness exists. Indications for use include the repair of hernias and/or abdominal wall defects that require the use of reinforcing or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical outcome. Our OviTex products can be used in a variety of hernia repairs, including simple and complex ventral, inguinal and hiatal hernias, as well as abdominal wall reconstructions.
Our OviTex products are sterile reinforced tissue matrices derived from ovine rumen with either polypropylene or PGA. The product is provided in a dry and hydratable form and packaged in a double pouched configuration. The product can be stored at room temperature and only needs five minutes from rehydration to use. To be used in surgery our OviTex product is placed in a sterile dish, rehydrated with sterile saline for five minutes, trimmed to fit the site, if needed, and then positioned to achieve maximum contact between the device and the surrounding tissue. The device may be sutured, stapled or tacked into place to avoid excess tension.
All of our OviTex products were designed to minimize the amount of polymer material implanted in patients. The synthetic material in our OviTex products comprise less than 5% of our final product. Depending on the configuration selected, the amount of polymer is approximately 75% less than the polymer content of the most widely implanted permanent synthetic mesh, thereby reducing the patient’s foreign body inflammatory response to the polymer.
We market a variety of OviTex products in a range of sizes, thicknesses and degrees of reinforcement in order to suit surgeon preference and desired surgical technique. Our OviTex portfolio is designed to allow surgeons to select a device appropriate for any abdominal tissue plane. Generally, surgeons may place the reinforced tissue matrix in direct contact with internal organs, known as intraperitoneal placement, or away from these internal organs in a variety of tissue planes, known as pre-peritoneal placement. When selecting a product for intraperitoneal placement, surgeons require a surface that minimizes the risk of tissue attachment, whereas when selecting a product for pre-peritoneal placement, surgeons are able to use a product with polymer exposure on both sides. Surgeons may select the most appropriate product from our OviTex portfolio based on the size of the defect, necessity or surgeon preference for internal organ contact, use of a minimally invasive or open surgical technique and risk of infection.
OviTex Laparoscopic and Robotic Procedures
Our OviTex for Laparoscopic and Robotic Procedures (“OviTex LPR”) is a sterile reinforced tissue matrix derived from ovine rumen with polypropylene fiber intended to be used in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia surgical repairs. OviTex LPR was designed for use with a trocar and requires the same rehydration and fixation as our other OviTex products. This product includes design elements to improve surgical handling, including two extra embroidered lines of blue colored polypropylene fibers to enhance endoscopic orientation and alignment. This product can be introduced into the patient’s body through various sized trocar ports. Based on surgeon feedback, OviTex LPR was designed in an elliptical or circular shape to minimize trimming.

OviTex Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery — OviTex PRS
OviTex PRS, has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained by Aroa and is held by us, and is indicated for use in implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our OviTex PRS product can be stored at room temperature and comes in the same packaging and requires the same rehydration and fixation as our OviTex products.
Our OviTex PRS product is a sterile reconstructive reinforced tissue matrix composed of three layers of ovine rumen joined by a patented corner-lock embroidered diamond patterned polymer (PGA or polypropylene) that allows the product to stretch while also maintaining its shape. Machine punched regularly spaced fenestrations, or holes, and die-cut slits in the product facilitate fluid management, allow for rapid cellular infiltration and create a directional bias to the stretch. Our OviTex PRS product is available in arced rectangle and half-moon shapes in a range of sizes (4 × 16 cm through 20 × 20 cm) to suit surgeon preference and nature of the soft tissue repair in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The device may be trimmed to a desired shape to further accommodate individual anatomy. The current shelf life of permanent OviTex PRS is 24 months and the current shelf life of resorbable OviTex PRS is 8 to 12 months.

Product Pipeline and Research and Development
We continue to advance our product pipeline to broaden our treatment capabilities for soft tissue reinforcement. As we innovate and develop our products, the new features and improved surgical techniques expand the clinical applications for soft tissue reinforcement. Areas of focus include enhanced surgical handling, increased permeability, and longer-acting resorbable polymers. Improving the surgical handling and implementation of our devices benefits both the clinician and patient. Increasing product permeability encourages a more-natural healing response. Longer-acting polymers can provide additional support for patients that need more time to heal. We believe these technology enhancements will continue to bolster our portfolio and expand the successful use of our products.
Clinical Results and Studies
Overview of Preclinical and Clinical Programs
One of our key strategies is to continuously obtain evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of our products, which we believe will differentiate us from our competitors. As part of our strategy to gather and analyze high-quality data, we seek to ensure rigorous and reliable data collection and reporting. The data from our preclinical and clinical studies strengthens our ability to raise surgeon awareness and drive adoption of our products as a new category of soft tissue reconstruction products. We expect our clinical evidence will provide surgeons with safety and efficacy data on the appropriate use of our products and we plan to obtain further clinical evidence to support additional regulatory clearances or approvals of our reinforced tissue matrices for additional indications for use in the future.
We believe we have completed the largest non-human primate preclinical studies conducted in soft tissue reconstruction surgery and we expect to conduct additional non-human primate preclinical studies as part of our product development process. Non-human primates are considered the most suitable animal model to predict the human immune and inflammatory responses to soft tissue reconstruction devices. Although not required for FDA clearance of our reinforced tissue matrices, we completed these preclinical studies prior to implantation of our products in human patients. In these studies, we compared our OviTex and OviTex PRS products to market leading competitive materials. In these studies, our reinforced tissue matrices exhibited a minimal inflammatory response, rapid cellular infiltration and revascularization and demonstrated early and complete remodeling into functional tissue.
We are currently sponsoring our BRAVO study. The study was fully enrolled at 92 patients. The interim analysis includes patient cohorts at the 90-day, 12-month and 24-month follow-up periods. At 90 days post-operative, there were no recurrences or reoperations among 84 of the patients analyzed. There was one implant removal due to a bowel perforation. The final 12-month analysis includes 76 patients, of whom two patients experienced a recurrence, both adjacent to the original repair, with the OviTex repairs remaining intact. Twenty patients experienced a surgical site 

20



occurrence of whom ten required a procedural intervention such as wound debridement or percutaneous drainage. None required a surgical intervention. Of the 51 patients that have reached 24-month follow-up, one patient experienced a surgical site occurrence and none experienced a recurrence or long-term complication. Additional results from the 30-day and 24-month patient cohorts showing low rates of surgical site occurrences requiring treatment were presented in September 2020 at the Americas Hernia Society Annual Meeting. This clinical study included patients with a range of comorbidities, prior hernia repairs and history of surgical infections, predisposing them to complications. Excluded were morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40 kg/m2) and those with a CDC wound class 4 (dirty/infected). The patients were treated using either an open or minimally invasive surgical approach. These findings are generally corroborated by similar clinical data from multiple published retrospective studies in a variety of hernia repairs utilizing our OviTex products. 
Our OviTex PRS products, designed for plastic and reconstructive surgery, utilize the same ovine rumen biologic material and interwoven polymer fibers as our OviTex products, but differ in their overall design. Our OviTex PRS reinforced tissue matrices have also been evaluated in a non-human primate model and demonstrated less inflammation and earlier remodeling into functional tissue than the leading biologic matrix used in plastic and reconstructive surgical procedures. Surgeons are beginning to utilize our OviTex PRS reinforced tissue matrices in their surgeries and we plan to collect, analyze and support the presentation of clinical data to characterize the performance of our reconstructive reinforced tissue matrices. We also intend to support independent investigator initiated retrospective clinical studies on the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex PRS products.
Preclinical In Vivo Evaluation of our OviTex Product in Non-Human Primates
We evaluated the biologic performance of two configurations of our OviTex reinforced tissue matrices in comparison to five currently available reconstruction materials and two other reconstruction materials that are no longer commercially available, including permanent synthetic mesh, resorbable synthetic mesh and biologic matrices in non-human primate studies, with 73 non-human primates. We selected the African Green monkeys for use in this study because this primate is closely related to and shares greater than 98% of their genetic code with humans. This non-human primate model has been used extensively to evaluate clinical and immune responses to pathogens, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals, and to predict xenograft biocompatibility for abdominal wall repair.
In accordance with the study protocol, the animals were anesthetized and a 7 × 3 cm full thickness “window” defect was created in the midline of the abdominal wall. The defect was then repaired with a reconstruction material of equal size, which was sutured in place to repair the defect and the skin was then sutured closed. Next the animals were euthanized at four, 12 or 24 weeks and the skin of the abdomen was dissected back to expose the site of the device. The graft site was evaluated for signs of herniation, inflammation, adhesions, contractions or other abnormalities. Then the length and width of the grafts were measured and the entire grafts and surrounding tissues were removed and photographed. Samples of the grafts were then prepared for analysis by an independent histopathologist. The most relevant data from this study came from the 24 week analysis.

OviTex
At 24 weeks, our OviTex reinforced tissue matrices best preserved their original geometry and exhibited limited contraction, had minimal inflammation, had rapid cellular infiltration and vascularization, and the grafts fully remodeled into host tissue (fastest rate of remodeling) with a higher degree of organized collagen than synthetics and biologics (on average).
Biologic Matrices
At 24 weeks, the biologics significantly contracted in length and expanded in width, had minimal inflammation, slow cellular infiltration and vascularization, and the grafts fully remodeled into host tissue (slower rate of remodeling than our OviTex product) and exhibited varying degrees of organized remodeled collagen.
Resorbable Synthetics
At 24 weeks, the resorbable synthetic material exhibited significant contraction, had mild to moderate inflammation (which persisted at elevated levels throughout the study), showed a substantial layer of early amorphous inflamed tissue adjacent to the device, and given that they contain no biologic material that can be remodeled, the scar-like collagen formed adjacent to the persistent synthetic mesh material, separated by a layer of loose connective and adipose tissue, which was also present between the mesh fibers.
Permanent Synthetics
At 24 weeks, the permanent synthetics exhibited a high degree of contraction in length and width, had mild to moderate inflammation (which persisted at elevated levels throughout the study), showed substantial layers of early amorphous tissue formed next to the device, and given that they have no biologic that can be remodeled, they exhibited disorganized and scar-like collagen surrounding the persistent synthetic mesh material.
Other Clinical Studies Using Our OviTex Products
A growing body of clinical evidence supports the safety, durability and effectiveness of our OviTex products for use in a range of hernia repair procedures including hiatal, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs and abdominal wall reconstruction. 
Preclinical Animal Testing of OviTex PRS
Our resorbable and permanent OviTex PRS products were evaluated in a non-human primate study, in which our OviTex PRS product was compared to AlloDerm at two, four, 12 and 24 weeks for differences in healing kinetics, as evidenced through inflammatory response, cellular infiltration, and the morphological quality of the newly remodeled tissue associated with each device. The inflammatory response for both the OviTex PRS groups and AlloDerm was minimal throughout, though the histiocytic response was higher in AlloDerm at the 4- and 12-week time points, decreasing by 24 weeks, but still slightly higher than in our resorbable OviTex PRS product. At four weeks, the highly permeable nature of our OviTex PRS product design enhanced fluid exchange evidenced by more effective and rapid infiltration of host cells in the collagen network. In comparison, the collagen network of AlloDerm developed a superficial layer of fibroblasts, covering the device, which macroscopically appeared white and largely inert. The earlier infiltration and faster recruitment of fibroblasts and host cells in our OviTex PRS product helped “jump start” the 

22



remodeling process into host tissue. At 12 weeks, our OviTex PRS product was fully remodeled and the maturation of the product was slightly ahead of that of AlloDerm at all time points. At 24 weeks, significant contraction was seen in all AlloDerm devices, as well as calcifications. The collagen in the AlloDerm specimens showed signs of maturation, much like our OviTex PRS products, which remodeled into mature collagen, consistent of compact lamellar bundles of low cellularity, occupying the entire defect site with functional tissue. After 24 weeks our OviTex PRS product was associated with a favorable tissue response, demonstrating rapid infiltration, earlier and more rapid tissue integration and slightly more advanced tissue remodeling in comparison to AlloDerm.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent and trademark rights, preserving the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operating without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Aroa License
In August 2012, we entered into the Aroa License, which was amended and restated in July 2015, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and know-how to develop, commercialize and sell bovine and ovine extracellular matrix products for hernia repair, abdominal wall and breast reconstruction in North America and Europe, which we refer to as the Licensed Territory. In addition, under the Aroa License, Aroa is our exclusive manufacturer and supplier for the development of our products.
Pursuant to the terms of the Aroa License, we made upfront payments to Aroa totaling $2.3 million and granted Aroa 74,316 newly issued shares of our restricted common stock. We have made additional payments in the aggregate of $2.0 million to Aroa following the achievement of certain regulatory and operational milestones, including FDA 510(k) clearance of our OviTex products, which clearance was obtained and is currently held by Aroa, for use in surgical soft tissue reinforcement and the receipt of the first CE mark for sale of our products in the European Economic Area for use in abdominal wall reconstruction and hernia repair and our acceptance of certain supply quantities manufactured by Aroa for our commercial launch in Europe. In addition, we paid Aroa $3.0 million in revenue-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain net sales thresholds for sales of our products within the Licensed Territory. An additional $1.0 million payment will be made to Aroa when cumulative product net sales of our products in the European territory reach certain amounts.
We are responsible for marketing the products manufactured for us by Aroa. We pay Aroa for the supply and manufacturing of our products through a revenue sharing agreement. Pursuant to the Aroa License, we retain 73% of the net sales of all of our products and pay Aroa the remaining 27%. If at any point during the term of the Aroa License we and Aroa determine that our anticipated product needs exceed Aroa’s manufacturing capabilities, we and Aroa will mutually approve an expansion and equally share the cost of such expansion. Our share of such expansion costs may be offset by us against future revenue share payments.
The initial term of the Aroa License terminates on the later of (i) August 3, 2022, or (ii) the expiration of the last patent covering bovine and ovine products currently April 19, 2031, with an option to extend for an additional ten year period. Either party may terminate the Aroa License upon the other party’s material breach, subject to a ninety-day notice and cure period or upon thirty-days written notice in the event of bankruptcy. We may terminate manufacture and production of a specific product upon thirty-days prior written notice upon (i) a reasonable determination that such product infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party, (ii) an uncured supply failure by Aroa or (iii) such product proves unfeasible, and immediately upon written notice from a regulatory authority that such product must be withdrawn from the market. If we materially breach the Aroa License in one of the Licensed Territories, Aroa may terminate the Aroa License solely with respect to the Licensed Territory in which the breach occurred. Upon termination of the Aroa License, we have the right to purchase all or any part of the unsold portion of any completed products from Aroa and the right to continue to sell all products remaining in our inventory.

23



The Aroa License also contains customary representations and warranties, confidentiality, insurance, audit, indemnification and non-competition provisions.
Patents
As of December 31, 2020, we exclusively license two issued U.S. patents that will expire in 2029 and 2031. We own ten U.S. issued or allowed patents which will expire between 2035 and 2038 and eight pending U.S. patent applications, which subject to issuance, are projected to expire between 2035 and 2040, without taking into account potential patent term extensions or adjustments. In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we also own four non-U.S. patent applications, which, subject to issuance, would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2037 and have exclusively licensed issued patents in Europe and Canada that will expire in 2029.
Our patents and patent applications cover, among other things, our corner-lock embroidery pattern, the use of adhesion barriers sewn into soft tissue and compliance associated with stretching.
Although the term of individual patents varies depending upon the country in which they were granted, in most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the U.S., a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.

We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Trademarks
We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. TELA Bio®, OviTex® and OviTex PRS® are registered trademarks of ours in the U.S.
For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters.”
Research and Development
We invest in research and development to advance our reinforced tissue matrix products with the goal of improving upon and supplementing our existing product offerings. We believe our ability to rapidly develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of our products is attributable to the dynamic product innovation process that we have implemented, the versatility and leveragability of our core technology and the management philosophy behind that process. We have recruited and retained engineers and scientists with significant experience in the development of polymer science, biologics, textile engineering and analytical testing. We have a number of design improvements for our reinforced tissue matrices in various stages of development that are expected to enhance our current products and increase surgeon adoption of our products. In addition, we intend to engage in discussions with the FDA regarding an 

24



IDE protocol to study the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS portfolio for an indication in breast reconstruction surgery. The FDA has stated that a PMA, rather than 510(k) clearance, will be required for such an indication. Our research and development efforts are based at our facility in Malvern, Pennsylvania.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial efforts are predominantly focused on the U.S. market where we have established strong relationships with key constituencies, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, GPOs, IDN, third-party payors and other key clinical and economic decision makers by offering a unique high quality, cost-effective product. As part of our overall commercial strategy, we intend to contract with GPOs and IDNs to increase access and penetration with hospital accounts. We have invested in our direct sales and marketing infrastructure in order to expand our presence to promote awareness and adoption of our products. There are currently more than 325 active hospital accounts in the U.S. that have incorporated our products into their practices.
We market our products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, surgeons, GPOs, IDNs and medical device supply chain participants primarily through our direct sales force. Our sales representatives and sales managers have substantial medical device experience. As of December 31, 2020, we had 64 employees in our U.S. based commercial organization in 45 sales territories, which includes account managers and administrative support staff. We plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by adding account managers, clinical development specialists and administrative support staff in order to cover the highest potential of accounts for soft tissue reconstruction procedures.
Manufacturing
All our raw materials are sourced through and manufactured by Aroa in their Auckland, New Zealand facility under the terms of the Aroa License. Aroa’s facility is approximately 25,000 square feet of which approximately 10,000 square feet is dedicated to manufacturing. This facility recently completed a short-term expansion to increase capacity with additional process equipment and work shifts, and a further intermediate-term expansion is planned in 2021, with approximately 15,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space available. Expansions are mutually agreed between us and Aroa, and under the terms of the Aroa License we share 50% of the expansion cost, which we may later offset against our revenue share payment to Aroa. The Auckland facility is FDA registered and ISO 13485 certified. We believe that Aroa will be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our products to meet anticipated customer demands. In the event of an uncured supply failure by Aroa, we have the right to, directly or through a third-party, step in and operate the Aroa Auckland facility to manufacture our products on behalf of Aroa.
The proprietary ovine rumen used in the manufacturing of our products is obtained from sheep raised for human consumption in New Zealand and is currently sourced by Aroa from two abattoirs, or slaughterhouses. Although only two abattoirs are currently used, there are more than 30 additional abattoirs in New Zealand that could be used to source the ovine rumen. New Zealand cattle and sheep are considered by the USDA to be free of prion disease (progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including scrapie). The sheep receive veterinary inspection prior to slaughter and then each carcass is inspected post-mortem for the presence of disease according to USDA approved standards. Only sheep which pass full inspection can be used as a raw tissue source for our products and all the ovine rumen is processed in compliance with the FDA’s regulations for Medical Devices Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources. Once the ovine rumen is procured, our reinforced tissue matrix products are then manufactured by Aroa at its facility in Auckland, New Zealand.
Distribution
All of our products are shipped directly from Auckland, New Zealand to our headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We sell our products directly to our customers, which are hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Except for our stocking distributors in Europe, we do not use distributors to sell our products.

Competition
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants.
In the hernia repair market our primary competitors are Bard, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company, which produces Phasix and Ventralight ST, and LifeCell, a subsidiary of AbbVie, which produces Strattice. In the plastic and reconstructive surgery market, our primary competitor is LifeCell, a subsidiary of AbbVie, which produces AlloDerm.
Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:

● | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


● | broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | more established distribution networks;
--+----------------------------------------


● | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that our continued ability to compete favorably depends on:

● | successfully expanding our commercial operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | continuing to innovate and maintain scientifically-advanced technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | maintaining and obtaining intellectual property protection for our products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting clinical studies and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products in the U.S. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.
Regulatory System for Medical Devices in the U.S.
All of our medical devices sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) as implemented and enforced by the FDA.

26



Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulations, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent to a medical device cleared through the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA.
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. By regulation, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.

27



If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification procedure, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination.
Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The FDA has undertaken efforts to modernize the 510(k) clearance process. In January 2019, the agency finalized guidance outlining the framework for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. This option for 510(k) clearance will allow manufacturers to use objective performance criteria established or recognized by the FDA to facilitate demonstration of substantial equivalence of their new products to legally marketed devices. This new pathway will ensure that the performance characteristics of new devices are evaluated against a set of objective, transparent and well-validated safety and performance metrics. Devices using this pathway will still have to meet current standards for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness before they can be marketed. 
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would support a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.

28



The PMA Approval Process
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. While our current products are subject to the 510(k) clearance pathway, any future products or modifications to our existing products that we plan to develop for a breast reconstruction indication would be subject to the PMA approval process.
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application can occur over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, or the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., a major deficiency letter) within 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for changes to an approved device, such as modifications to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory committee, depending on the nature of the proposed change.

29



In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
The Investigational Device Process
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Some types of studies deemed to present a “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board, or IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by an appropriate IRB. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA good clinical practice regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply to our business operations, products and technologies. These include:

● | the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and marketing regulations which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30




● | complying with new requirements for Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advertising and promotion requirements, including FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses and FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | device establishment, registration and listing requirements and annual reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval or clearance of modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s refusal of requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
The European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland and, until 2021, the United Kingdom) has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The European Union Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the EU.
The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with a CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité, also referred to as a Certificate of Conformance. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before a CE mark can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessments for products are carried out as required by the MDD. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-certify compliance with the MDD based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the EU without further conformance tests being required in other member states.
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the MDD and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. The Medical Devices Regulation will be fully implemented in May 2021. The new regulations will among other things:

● | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy and Security Laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. Among others, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and require covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, among other requirements.

32



Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. Companies subject to HIPAA must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule which requires notification of affected patients and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and in certain cases of media outlets, in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states, and HIPAA standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance.
Many states have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, to which we are subject. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted.
We may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting, and laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach.
EU member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical and medical device companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from (among other things) knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual, or the recommending, furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Courts have interpreted the Anti-Kickback Statute quite broadly, holding that the statute will be violated if even one purpose of a payment — though not its sole or primary purpose — is to induce an act prohibited by the statute with a willful intent to act improperly. The statute prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Prosecutors may infer intent from the surrounding circumstances and, because courts have interpreted the statute to be violated if even one purpose of a payment is to induce the purchase of items or services paid for by federal healthcare programs, prosecutors have broad discretion in choosing arrangements to prosecute under the statute. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” available to protect certain appropriately structured arrangements that otherwise would implicate the Anti-Kickback

Statute and those who structure their business arrangements to satisfy all of the criteria of a safe harbor are protected from liability under the statute. Our business is subject to these laws.
Many states have adopted anti-kickback and self-referral laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, some of these state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to arrangements involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and not only by Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. These state laws do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
False Claims Laws
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any individual or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of lawsuits brought against healthcare industry participants by private individuals has increased dramatically.
There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government, but also may arise when an entity knowingly makes a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. Various states have also enacted false claims and insurance fraud laws that are analogous to the federal False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply to claims submitted to any third-party payor and are not limited to claims submitted to a federal healthcare program. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on a company’s ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Transparency Laws
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”) which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) generally requires certain manufacturers of a drug, device, biologic or other medical supply that is covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program and applicable GPOs to report on an annual basis: (i) certain payments and other transfers of value given to certain healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and (ii) any ownership or investment interest that certain healthcare professionals, or their immediate family members, have in their company. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a healthcare professional, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. Under the statute, the federal government makes reported information available to the public. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties or criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in the reports.
There has been a recent trend of separate state regulation of payments and transfers of value by manufacturers of medical devices to healthcare professionals and entities, however, and some state transparency laws apply more broadly than the federal Sunshine Act. There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring manufacturers to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of physician and patient identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. All of our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition.

Other Federal Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We may also be subject to other federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including provisions of HIPAA, which prohibit knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, as well as knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
International Laws
In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. 
In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. There have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals 

35



who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. 
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Presidential administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control healthcare costs, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and there are continuing legislative and regulatory efforts by the federal government and the states to reduce the cost of medical products and services overall. We may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or procedure using the product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate revenue levels. Future legislation could limit payments for medical devices, including our products and our future products.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of less costly products. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on medical product and service pricing.
