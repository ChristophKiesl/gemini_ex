Corporate Items and Eliminations: Includes interest expense and costs related to corporate support functions including executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk management and sales and marketing costs not allocated to the business units, and also includes eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments. Corporate Items and Eliminations also include the cost of certain facilities.
We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests. In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue. Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services. Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin. Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services that we pass directly on to our customers without a markup. Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One and Best Partners Mortgage Brokers Cooperative, Inc., a mortgage cooperative doing business as Wholesale One® (“Wholesale One”), consolidated entities not owned by Altisource, and are included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource.
Customers
Our customers include some of the largest financial institutions in the United States, government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), utility companies, commercial banks, servicers, investors, non-bank originators and correspondent lenders, mortgage bankers, insurance companies and financial services companies. During 2016, we signed a significant number of agreements and statements of work with strategic customers positioning us well for 2017. Our largest customer, Ocwen, accounted for 56% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned directly from Ocwen and revenue earned from the loans serviced by Ocwen when Ocwen designates us as the service provider. Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Mortgage Services | 60% | 63% | 67% 
Financial Services | 17% | 21% | 27% 
Technology Services | 42% | 54% | 42% 
Consolidated revenue | 56% | 60% | 60% 

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenue from Ocwen of $561.9 million, $631.6 million and $650.7 million, respectively. Services provided to Ocwen during such periods and reported in the Mortgage Services segment included real estate asset management and sales, residential property valuation, trustee management services, property preservation and inspection services and insurance services. Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Financial Services segment included mortgage charge-off collections. Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Technology Services segment included IT infrastructure management and software applications. As of December 31, 2016, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $26.2 million, $15.8 million of which was billed and $10.4 million of which was unbilled.
We record revenue we earn from Ocwen under the terms of master services agreements and amendments thereto (collectively, the “Ocwen Service Agreements”).
We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selects Altisource as the service provider. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $188.0 million, $216.9 million and $256.0 million, respectively, related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selected Altisource as the service provider. These amounts are not included in deriving the revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue in the table above.
Our services are provided to customers primarily located in the United States. Financial information for our segments can be found in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing
We have a proven enterprise sales and marketing team, along with business unit sales executives, with extensive relationship management and industry experience. These individuals cultivate and maintain relationships throughout the industry sectors we serve. We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms.

Our primary sales and marketing focus areas for institutional customers are to:

• | Expand relationships with existing customers by cross-selling additional services and growing the volume of existing services we provide. We believe our existing customers represent a meaningful growth opportunity for us; 


• | Develop new customer relationships leveraging a comprehensive suite of services, strong performance and controls. We believe there is a large opportunity to provide our services to new customers; and

Some of our newer offerings include our suite of support services for FHA mortgages, Vendorly™, a SaaS-based vendor management platform, Trelix Connect™, a SaaS-based loan review system, noteXchange®, a SaaS platform to facilitate whole loan purchase and sale transactions, and residential and commercial loan disbursement processing, risk mitigation and construction inspection services.

Given the highly diverse nature of the industries we serve, the time and effort we spend in expanding relationships or winning new relationships is significant.
Intellectual Property and Data
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trademarks and copyrights to establish and protect our trade secrets, intellectual property, software, technology and expertise. We also own or, as necessary and appropriate, have obtained licenses from third parties to intellectual property relating to our services, processes and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors in the success of our businesses.
As of December 31, 2016, we have been awarded one patent that expires in 2023, four patents that expire in 2024, seven patents that expire in 2025, two patents that expire in 2026, two patents that expire in 2029 and one patent that expires in 2030. In addition, we have registered trademarks, or recently filed applications for the registration of trademarks, in a number of jurisdictions including the United States, the European Union (“EU”), India and nine other jurisdictions. These trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely, provided they are being used in commerce.
We actively protect our rights and intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem reasonable and necessary to develop and protect our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights.
In addition, we may make use of data in connection with certain of our services. This data generally relates to real property information, mortgage information and consumer information. We gather this data from a variety of third party sources, including from governmental entities and, subject to licensed usage rights and legally permitted usage, we use this data in connection with our delivery of services.
Furthermore, we may also combine this data, subject to licensed usage rights and legally permitted usage, with proprietary data we generate and apply statistical data correction and proprietary algorithms to further enhance data in connection with other services in an attempt to predict metrics of interest across time periods and geographic boundaries in connection with certain of our services.
Market and Competition
We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms. The mortgage and real estate markets are very large and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, home prices, inflation, unemployment rates and consumer confidence.
The markets to provide services for mortgage servicers and mortgage originators are highly competitive and generally consist of a few national companies, in-house providers and a large number of regional and local providers. We typically compete based upon product and service offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
The markets to provide services for buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and numerous start-up companies. We typically compete based upon product and service offerings, product and service delivery, ease of transacting, price and personal service.
6

For financial services firms, we provide collection services and customer relationship management services. The markets to provide these services are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and in-house providers. We typically compete based upon product and service offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
Our competitors may have greater financial resources, brand recognition, alternative or disruptive products and other competitive advantages. We cannot determine our market share with certainty, but believe for mortgage servicers and collection services for financial services firms, we have a modest share of the market, and for the others we have relatively small market share.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had the following number of employees:

 | United States | India | | Philippines | Uruguay | Luxembourg | | Consolidated Altisource
Mortgage Services | 642 | | 2,659 | | 381 | | 15 | | 5 | 3,702
Financial Services | 482 | | 1,401 | | 300 | | — | | 1 | 2,184
Technology Services | 416 | | 1,267 | | 9 | | — | | 3 | 1,695
Corporate | 163 | | 432 | | 20 | | 145 | | 15 | 775 
Total employees | 1,703 | | 5,759 | | 710 | | 160 | | 24 | 8,356

We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.
Seasonality
Certain of our revenues are impacted by seasonality. More specifically, revenues from property sales, originations and lawn maintenance in our Mortgage Services segment tend to be at their lowest level during fall and winter months and at their highest level during spring and summer months. Financial Services’ asset recovery management revenue tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the rest of the year.
Government Regulation
Our business and the business of our customers are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Bank Service Company Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the state and local agencies that license or oversee certain of our auction, real estate brokerage, mortgage and debt collection services, trustee services, property management services and insurance services. We also must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices statutes (“UDAAP”), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), the Homeowners Protection Act (“HPA”), the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (“CHBR”), the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (“RPAPL”), the Fair Housing Act and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (“SAFE”) Act. We are also subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws, due to our activities in foreign jurisdictions.
Legal requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended. One such enacted regulation is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and includes reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the CFPB, a federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services and products. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (“Mortgage Act”). The Mortgage Act imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending and expanding certain existing regulations. The interpretation or enforcement by regulatory authorities of applicable laws and regulations also may change over time. In addition, the creation of new regulatory authorities or changes in the regulatory authorities overseeing applicable laws and regulations may also result in changing interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations.
Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or changing interpretation of such laws or regulations could subject the Company to criminal or civil liability, significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders affecting us or our customers 
7

that may curtail or restrict the business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Furthermore, certain of our technology services are provided at the direction and pursuant to the identified requirements of our customers. The failure of our customers to properly identify or account for regulatory requirements applicable to such technology services could expose us to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We may be subject to licensing and regulation as a provider of certain services including, among others, services as a mortgage origination underwriter, valuation provider, appraisal management company, asset manager, property manager, title insurance agent, insurance broker and underwriter, real estate broker, auctioneer, foreclosure trustee and debt collector in a number of states. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by various state commissions for the particular type of service sold and to participate in regular continuing education programs. Periodically, we are subject to audits and examinations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities relating to certain aspects of our business. We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any of these inquiries. In conjunction with one such inquiry, on November 10, 2016, Altisource received a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (“NORA”) letter from the CFPB indicating that the CFPB is considering a potential enforcement action against Altisource relating to an alleged violation of federal law that primarily concerns certain technology services provided to Ocwen. We understand that a NORA letter provides the recipient an opportunity to present its position to the CFPB before an enforcement action is recommended or commenced. On December 15, 2016, we provided a written response to the NORA letter setting forth the legal, policy and factual reasons why we believe an enforcement action is not warranted. We are committed to resolving any potential concerns of the CFPB. If the CFPB were to bring an enforcement action against us, the resolution of such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. However, we believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any potential CFPB enforcement action that may be under consideration.
