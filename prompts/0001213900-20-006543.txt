Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on June 5, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 28, 2018, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware. Our management team is led by Andrew Gould, our Chairman, who has more than 41 years’ experience in global energy and related business, and Krishna Shivram, our Chief Executive Officer, who has 30 years’ experience in the oil and gas business. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the initial public offering and the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for a business combination.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation
 
We were not able to consummate a business combination prior to the November 7, 2019 deadline under our certificate of incorporation (the “Charter”). As a result, and after careful consideration, we determined to liquidate the trust account that we established in connection with our initial public offering (the “trust account”) and return the funds held therein to our public stockholders in accordance with our Charter, which completely extinguished the public stockholders’ rights as stockholders. There were no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which expired worthless as a result of our failure to complete a business combination by November 7, 2019.
 
Pursuant to our Charter, we: (i) ceased all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) redeemed the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption completely extinguished public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) liquidated the trust account, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In connection with the redemption of the public shares, each stockholder received approximately $10.30 per share on November 18, 2019. We withheld approximately $1,300,000 from the distribution and once our income tax liability is finalized for the year ended December 31, 2019, we will distribute the remaining proceeds to the public stockholders.
 
Employees
 
We currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary.

Recent Events
 
On November 6, 2019, board of directors (our "Board") announced that it cancelled the special meeting of stockholders relating to extending the time by which we had to complete our initial business combination that was scheduled to take place that day and had determined to redeem all of our outstanding public shares, effective as of the close of business on November 7, 2019, because we did not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by our Charter. Public shares ceased trading as of the open of business on November 8, 2019 in order to allow time for the settlement of trades.

As of the close of business on November 7, 2019, the public shares were deemed cancelled and represented only the right to receive a per-share redemption price determined by the net of taxes and dissolution expenses, determined to be approximately $10.30 (the “Redemption Amount”). There were no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders waived their redemption rights with respect to the outstanding common stock issued prior to our initial public offering. Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) filed a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to delist our securities on November 7, 2019.
 
On December 9, 2019, we held a special meeting of public warrantholders. The holders of warrants sold as part of the units sold in our initial public offering (the “Public Warrants”) voted to amend the Warrant Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2017, by and among the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Warrant Agreement”) so that all of the Public Warrants were automatically converted into the right to receive $0.02 per whole Public Warrant, payable in cash. Only the Public Warrants were converted into the right to receive cash. In addition, Sentinel Management Holdings, LLC agreed to forfeit (i) all of the 5,933,333 private placement warrants and (ii) 90% of the 8,550,000 founder shares held by it to us for no consideration. Additionally, each of Jon A. Marshall and Marc Zenner agreed to forfeit 90% of the 37,500 founder shares held by him.
 
On December 19, 2019, each of Ronald Steger and Craig Levering submitted his resignation from our Board.
