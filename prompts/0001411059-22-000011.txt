ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and it intends to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our remaining real estate property. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned one office property. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 183,346,918 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
On November 13, 2019, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, a special committee composed of all of our independent directors (the “Special Committee”) and our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”). The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling our assets, paying our debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. On March 5, 2020, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. The Plan of Liquidation is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Plan of Liquidation
In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, our objectives are to pursue an orderly liquidation of our company by selling all of our assets, paying our debts and our known liabilities, providing for the payment of unknown or contingent liabilities, distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders and winding up our operations and dissolving our company. 
Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, our board of directors has authorized five liquidating distributions:

Record Date | Payment Date | Liquidating Distribution Per Share
March 5, 2020 | March 10, 2020 | $ | 0.75
August 3, 2020 | August 7, 2020 | $ | 0.25
December 24, 2020 | December 30, 2020 | $ | 0.40
October 1, 2021 | October 5, 2021 | $ | 0.50
December 9, 2021 | December 14, 2021 | $ | 0.20

We expect to distribute substantially all of the remaining proceeds from liquidation after the completion of the sale of our remaining real estate property. At the time of adopting the Plan of Liquidation, we had anticipated completing the orderly liquidation of our company and paying substantially all of our liquidating distributions from the net proceeds from liquidation within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, which occurred on March 5, 2020. Given the uncertainty and business disruptions as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, our completion of the Plan of Liquidation has been delayed. We currently anticipate that we will complete our liquidation by the third quarter of 2022. Although we were not able to complete our liquidation within the 24-month period described above, we do not anticipate any material unfavorable tax consequences to our stockholders or to our status as a REIT. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) we did not have any current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any gain) or taxable income or gain for the taxable years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 and (ii) we do not anticipate any current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any gain) or taxable income or gain in the future.
Our expectations about the amount of future liquidating distributions that we will pay and when we will pay them are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of any additional liquidating distributions we pay to stockholders may be less than we estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. There are many factors that may affect the amount of liquidating distributions we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. If we underestimate our existing obligations and liabilities or the amount of taxes, transaction fees and expenses relating to the liquidation and dissolution, or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. Moreover, the liquidation value will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to our remaining real estate property, in response to the real estate and finance markets, based on the actual liquidation timing and the amount of net proceeds received from the disposition of our remaining asset and due to other factors. Given the uncertainty and current business disruptions as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation may be materially and adversely impacted and this may have a material effect on the ultimate amount and timing of liquidating distributions received by our stockholders. While we have considered the impact from COVID-19 in our net assets in liquidation presented on the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2021, the extent to which our business may be affected by COVID-19 depends on future developments with respect to the continued spread and treatment of the virus, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Outlook — Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets — COVID-19 Pandemic and Portfolio Outlook” for a discussion of the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our business and our liquidation. We can give no assurance regarding the timing of the disposition of our remaining asset, the sale price we will receive for this asset, and the amount or timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders.
Real Estate Portfolio

Granite Tower
On December 16, 2010, we acquired a 31-story office building located in Denver, Colorado containing 593,527 rentable square feet on approximately 0.7 acres of land (“Granite Tower”). 
On September 3, 2021, we completed the sale of Granite Tower to a purchaser unaffiliated with us or our advisor for $203.5 million, or $174.1 million net of credits given to the purchaser primarily for outstanding tenant improvements and lease incentives, before third-party closing costs of approximately $1.0 million and excluding disposition fees payable to our advisor of $1.7 million.

On September 20, 2021, we completed the sale of Fountainhead Plaza to a purchaser unaffiliated with us or our advisor for $117.5 million, or $117.3 million net of closing credits, before third-party closing costs of approximately $0.8 million and excluding disposition fees payable to our advisor of $1.2 million. 
Corporate Technology Centre - 300 Holger
On March 28, 2013, we acquired an office campus consisting of eight office buildings totaling 610,083 rentable square feet located on approximately 32.7 acres of land in San Jose, California (“Corporate Technology Centre”). 
On November 23, 2021, we completed the sale of the remaining office building in Corporate Technology Centre containing 99,870 rentable square feet (“300 Holger”) to a purchaser unaffiliated with us or our advisor for $35.0 million, before third-party closing costs of approximately $0.8 million and excluding disposition fees payable to our advisor of $0.4 million.

On December 8, 2021, we completed the sale of Willow Oaks Corporate Center to a purchaser unaffiliated with us or our advisor for $106.0 million, or $101.7 million net of credits primarily for outstanding tenant improvements and lease incentives, before third-party closing costs of approximately $1.1 million and excluding disposition fees payable to our advisor of $1.0 million. 
Remaining Real Estate Investment
As of December 31, 2021, we owned one office property located in Los Angeles, California, encompassing in the aggregate 701,888 rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2021, this property was 65% occupied. The estimated liquidation value of our remaining real estate property was $188.4 million as of December 31, 2021. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Financing Objectives
We financed the majority of our real estate investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. We also used debt financing to pay for capital improvements or repairs to properties; to refinance existing indebtedness; to pay distributions; to provide working capital and for other liquidity needs. 
With the proceeds from the sales of Granite Tower, Fountainhead Plaza, 300 Holger and Willow Oaks Corporate Center, we repaid a total of $240.5 million of outstanding notes payable during the year ended December 31, 2021, and we did not have any outstanding notes payable as of December 31, 2021. We do not intend to obtain additional debt financing in the future.
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the management of our remaining real estate property; the disposition of this property; the execution of the Plan of Liquidation; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 
Competitive Market Factors
We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many tenants to re-evaluate their space needs, resulting in a significant increase in sublease space available in the office market from tenants wanting to unload un-needed space. We face competition from these tenants, who may be more willing to offer significant discounts to prospective subtenants. As a result, our ability to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation may be adversely affected.
We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of our remaining real estate property. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property type as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of our remaining real estate property, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. 
This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for our remaining real estate property, which could adversely affect the overall return for our stockholders and the amount and timing of liquidating distributions our stockholders receive.
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively. 
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties were subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
