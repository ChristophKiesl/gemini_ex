ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(A) BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
.Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. (the "Company") was formed as a Florida corporation on March 5, 1999 under the name of B Twelve Inc. In August 2002, the Company changed its name from B Twelve, Inc. to Kyto BioPharma Inc. and in May 2018, the name was changed again to Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. In July 2019 the Company was re-incorporated as a Delaware company.
 
The Company was originally formed to acquire and develop innovative minimally toxic and non-immunosuppressive proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases and had been looking at a number of strategies to become active. In April, 2018, the Board adopted a new business plan focused on the development of early stage technology and life science businesses through early stage investment funding. The Company has recruited a number of experienced investment consultants from a network that includes angel investors, corporate managers, and successful entrepreneurs across a number of technology and life science products and markets and relies on input from these advisors in conducting due diligence and making investment decisions. In order to offset the risk in early stage investing, the Company works with angel investment groups and participates only after these groups have completed due diligence and committed to invest, and does not typically invest more than $250,000 in any single investment. Generally, the Companyâ€™s investments represent less than 5% ownership interests, and the Company therefore has no effective control or influence over the management or commercial decisions of the Companies in which it invests. The Company plans to generate revenue from realised gains from the sale of the businesses in which it has invested. 
 
Generally, it is expected that investments will be realised from an exit within a period of four years following investment. Such sales are outside its control and depend on M&A transactions which may result in cash or equity proceeds. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast revenue, net income, and cash flow. The Company currently has approximately $30,000 in the bank and is now actively marketing the first $3 million tranche of a Series B round with a target close date of September 2020. 
 
The Company has no regular employees, full-time or part-time. The chief executive officer of Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. is acting as a consultant to the Company and does not receive contractual compensation for his services in the form of cash. In the year ended March 31, 2020 he was granted 800,000 stock options as incentive compensation and an ex gratia bonus of $216,000 in recognition of his performance in raising funding, performance of due diligence, and making investments.
