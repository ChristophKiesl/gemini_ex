Overview
 
AxonPrime Infrastructure Acquisition Corporation (“Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 1, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (“business combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period April 1, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”) which is described below, and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s search for business combination candidates. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.


Company History
 
The Company’s sponsor is AxonPrime Infrastructure Sponsor LLC (“Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 units (“Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units, “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000, which is described in Item 13.
 
As part of the Initial Public Offering, certain Institutional Anchor Investors (“Institutional Anchor Investors”) not then affiliated with the Company, the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers, directors, or any member of the Company’s management purchased an aggregate of 12,790,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $127,900,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 3,333,333 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement (“Private Placement”) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000, which is described in Item 13. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Private Placement, the Sponsor sold an aggregate of 66,666 Private Placement Warrants to the Institutional Anchor Investors for $100,000.
 
The Institutional Anchor Investors also purchased 650,000 shares of Class B common stock (“Founder Shares”) from the Sponsor at the original purchase price of $0.003 per share (see Item 13). The Founder Shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of the Company’s initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided in the Company’s final prospectus, dated August 12, 2021, as filed with the SEC on August 16, 2021 (“Final Prospectus”).
 
The Company incurred offering costs in the Public Offering totaling $8,703,625, consisting of $3,000,000 of underwriting fees, $5,250,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $453,625 of other offering costs.
 


   
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 17, 2021, an amount of $150,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.
 
Business Strategy
 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for our shareholders over time. We believe our management team’s years of experience and our deep network of proprietary relationships will allow us to identify a wide range of attractive merger opportunities. Our networks include, among others, entrepreneurs, universities, research institutions, public and private company management teams (from early-stage venture to the Fortune 500), venture capital and private equity investors, investment bankers, attorneys, and management consultants.
 
Following the initial business combination, we expect to help the post-business combination entity continue its growth trajectory for many years to come. We expect to collaborate with management on a number of initiatives, including, but not limited to, navigating the public markets, mergers and acquisitions, capital allocation decisions, talent acquisition, and broadening their network of potential partners and customers through our proprietary networks. We believe our team’s track record of success and support of management teams will make us a partner of choice for a high-quality business.

 
 Our acquisition philosophy and criteria are rooted in several core tenets, consistent with those that we have utilized in the past:



• | Transformative and Scalable: We will focus on investing in companies that are developing breakthrough scientific and technological innovations in the areas of communication, robotics, building and construction technology, water, 3D printing and semiconductors. In addition, we believe a successful merger candidate must have innovations that have sizable potential markets and whose business models allow them to profitably scale to address those markets. We will seek to merge with a company that has achieved sufficient technology and business maturity while still maintaining significant runway to capture share in a large addressable market. We look for favorable trends and attractive unit economics which can be further enhanced as the business grows. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support and Build World Class Management Teams: We seek to partner with creative and ambitious management teams that have a track record of success to help them execute their vision. The combination of Axon Capital’s public market expertise and Prime Movers Labs’ science and technology platform offers management teams a unique resource set. Many potential merger candidates possess exceptional early-stage, growth focused, management teams that would benefit from our experience-based guidance and support as they grow rapidly, and particularly as they transition from private to public markets. We are seeking a partner where our long-term support and involvement will be welcome, and will help unlock outsized shareholder returns, including through our proprietary network and relationships. Our goal is not to be short-term facilitators, but rather be long-term value creation partners. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Science vs. Engineering Risk: We look for companies that have answered the core science questions and now focus on the engineering problem of scalability. We endeavor to avoid binary risk from investments in companies that are still assessing early stage prospects, and rather focus on companies where we can help them scale and transform into a public company creating long-term, sustainable, value for its shareholders.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our investment philosophy and strategy, we plan to identify high-quality businesses run by exceptional teams pursuing large market opportunities that are amenable to disruption by technology. We expect to be guided by the criteria outlined above in evaluating opportunities and may decide to focus on different aspects of our investment criteria depending on the market opportunity at the time of the contemplated merger.
 
These criteria are important but not exhaustive. The merits of any particular initial business combination will be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the IPO. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other businesses or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account.
 
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Listing rules for the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. There is currently no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.
 


   
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Common Stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any Public Shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the Trust Account is initially $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we paid to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our Sponsor has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and any Public Shares it may acquire during or after the IPO in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any Public Shares acquired by them. In addition, pursuant to the investment agreements, the Institutional Anchor Investors agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account (including applicable redemption rights), or any other asset of our company as a result of any liquidation of our company, with respect to any Founder Shares held by them. However, if the Institutional Anchor Investors acquire any Public Shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such Public Shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our Certificate of Incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC (“tender offer rules”) unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-l to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-l(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem Public Shares so long as (after such redemptions) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.

 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

  
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.
 


   
 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination, and the Institutional Anchor Investors agreed, pursuant to the terms of the investment agreements, to vote any Founder Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of our initial business combination with respect to Public Shares acquired by them, if any. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our pre-IPO stockholders (“initial stockholders”) and their permitted transferees will collectively own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination. The Institutional Anchor Investors agreed, pursuant to the investment agreements, to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account (including applicable redemption rights), or any other asset of our company as a result of any liquidation of our company, with respect to any Founder Shares held by them. However, if the Institutional Anchor Investors acquire any Public Shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights in connection with the completion of our initial business combination with respect to such Public Shares.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemptions) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our Public Shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (as defined herein), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 


   
Indemnity Obligations
 
The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
Conflicts of Interest
 
 Certain of our officers and directors expect to have, and any of them in the future may further have, fiduciary or contractual obligations to several other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us.
 
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided to any such officers and directors. We do not have any plans to waive the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors post-business combination.
 


   
 Certain of our officers and directors expect to have, and any of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a business similar to ours. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:
 

• | None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certain of our officers and directors expect to have, and any of them in the future may further have, fiduciary or contractual obligations to several other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts of interest, our board of directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. In addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors expect to sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and, while we intend to focus our search for a target business in the infrastructure sector, we are free to pursue an initial business combination with a target in any industry or geographic region. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete description of our management’s other affiliations, please see “— Founders, Directors, Director Nominees and Executive Officers.”

• | Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any Public Shares acquired by them. Additionally, our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of the IPO or during any Extension Period. Moreover, pursuant to the investment agreements, the Institutional Anchor Investors agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account (including applicable redemption rights), or any other asset of our company as a result of any liquidation of our company, with respect to any Founder Shares held by them. However, if our initial stockholders, any of our officers, directors or affiliates or any of the Institutional Anchor Investors acquired or acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of our Public Shares, and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. With certain limited exceptions, the Founder Shares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our initial stockholders until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination and (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers and directors directly or indirectly own Common Stock shares and warrants, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.

• | Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether to proceed with a particular business combination.

• | Our key personnel may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such key personnel was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
 The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.

 
 In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
 

• | the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our officers or directors in circumstances where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have, and there will not be any expectancy that any of our directors or officers will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to us. Below is a table summarizing the entities to which our officers, directors and director nominees currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may present a conflict of interest:

Accordingly, if any of the above officers or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
 
In addition, our Sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in the Company in connection with the initial business combination, although our Sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or current intention to do so. If our Sponsor or any of its affiliates elects to make additional investments, such proposed investments could influence our Sponsor’s motivation to complete an initial business combination.
 
In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, to vote their Founder Shares (and their permitted transferees will agree) and any Public Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any Public Shares acquired by them.
 
Competition
 
 We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire.
 
Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Our Sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in us, although our Sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or other duty to do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial business combination.


Employees
 
We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
