Item 1. Business
Overview 
To achieve our mission of enabling the ongoing revolution in biological sciences, we have created a platform for accessing and understanding live primary biology with unprecedented speed and scale. Our capabilities represent a step change in high throughput screening technology and can be used to unlock new insights in functional biology research and therapeutics discovery. Our value proposition is to provide a streamlined functional screening platform capable of observing rare interactions, underpinned by a unique combination of high throughput screening and live biology and, specifically, primary biology where applicable/valuable. 
Prior to Berkeley Lights, the platforms available to perform live biology assays typically consume or destroy cell models being tested. But with the Berkeley Lights Platform, customers can access primary tissue samples, including those that only live for short time periods ex vivo. They can also isolate, expand, manipulate, assay, and export unperturbed cells of interest for downstream analysis enabling significantly greater insight and flexibility. Not only do our customers gain both higher throughput and higher resolution, they do so while reducing time and cost. This is achieved on our OptoSelect chips, some of which can enable ten thousand plus individual cells on a single chip to be functionally characterized across multiple measurements. Processes that used to take weeks or months can now be completed in hours or days with an increased probability of success. We currently focus on enabling the large and rapidly growing markets of antibody therapeutics, cell line development, gene therapies, T Cell receptor (“TCR”) discovery and agriculture with our portfolio of commercial products and services. Our goal is to establish the Berkeley Lights Platform as the standard throughout the cell-based product value chain by increasing the probability of successful product development for our customers. 
The Berkeley Lights Platform can not only be used to characterize the performance of cells relevant to the desired cell-based product early in the discovery process but can also connect this phenotypic data to the genetic code for each cell. In contrast, current genomic technologies find sequences first and fail to deliver the functional information early in the process. Performing functional validation early reduces research and development expense by letting poorly performing cells fail early. We repeat this process of fail and advance many times throughout the process, identifying the best biology and delivering the best cells for what we believe will deliver the best product. We believe our platform rapidly provides the deepest information and largest relevant data cube, with linked phenotypic and genotypic data, on tens of thousands of live single cells relevant to the customers’ end product specifications. We believe we are the only company exclusively focused on this approach to functional cell biology, and we believe this level of scale and precision is not attainable with other approaches. This allows us and our customers and partners, either directly or through an engagement for our service offerings, to find the best cells by: 
•Performing rapid functional characterization of tens of thousands of single cells in parallel; 
•Precisely controlling the environment around each cell, and maintaining cells in a healthy state for further use; 
•Accessing a high degree of cell biodiversity including primary cell samples; 
•Engaging functional characterization across many parameters to identify relevant phenotypic characteristics, at single-cell resolution over time and connecting this to the genotypic information for each cell; 
•Performing a broad range of workflows, including single-cell assays, on an integrated platform; and 
•Digitally aggregating, accessing and analyzing a rich data library for each single cell. 
Using our platform, customers can perform functional characterization of single cells at scale, effectively, more often and early in the product development process. We believe this enables them to: 
•Accelerate their product development cycles; 
•Improve process yield and lower costs throughout the value chain; 
•Enable a broad range of complex therapeutic modalities in biopharmaceuticals; 
•Increase the probability of successfully developing cell-based products;

•Achieve revenue from their cell-based products sooner and potentially extend the product lifetime on the market prior to patent expiration; and 
•Increase return on investment for their cell-based products. 
Pending Acquisition of IsoPlexis
On December 21, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire IsoPlexis in an all-stock transaction with an estimated purchase price of $57.8 million as of December 16, 2022 (“IsoPlexis Acquisition”). Under the terms of the agreement, IsoPlexis shareholders will receive 0.612 shares of Berkeley Lights stock for each IsoPlexis share they hold. Following the close of the transaction, Berkeley Lights shareholders will own approximately 75.2 percent of the combined company, and IsoPlexis shareholders will own approximately 24.8 percent of the combined company. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to approval by shareholders of both Berkeley Lights and IsoPlexis and other customary closing conditions. If the merger closes, we expect the combined company to be renamed PhenomeX, which we believe will be a premier functional cell biology company that provides live cell biology research tools which deliver deep insights into cellular function and new perspectives on phenomes.
The Berkeley Lights Platform 
The Berkeley Lights Platform 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to functional cell biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform can deliver live biology, in the form of the best cells for the desired cell-based product. Using our platform, customers perform integrated workflows specific to a field of use to profile and capture relevant single-cell data, throughout the duration of the workflow, on tens of thousands of cells individually, in parallel and within a contained and precisely controlled environment. 
Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of proprietary consumables, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our proprietary OptoElectro Positioning (OEP) technology, which provides deterministic positioning of living single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, living single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. We also have workflows that can lyse, capture and barcode genetic information from select cells on a single OptoSelect chip, conduct reverse transcription, create cDNA libraries for sequencing and link sequencing results back to the unique cell identifiers.
Our platform also uses our proprietary NanoPen technology. NanoPens are small, roughly 1 nanoliter (or 1/50,000th of a drop of water) sized chambers, with proprietary surface coatings that provide precise and deterministic control of the environment around the cells. Through biomimetic design, our platform provides nutrients to, and removes waste from, each NanoPen to keep the cells in a healthy state while outside of their native environment. These mechanisms enable performance of a large variety of single-cell assays on live biology, including single-cell real-time imaging at high resolution. 
Table of Contents

OptoSelect chips 
Using our OEP technology, we select and move cells and other micro-objects in parallel into NanoPens on our proprietary OptoSelect chips. Within the NanoPen chambers, our platform can precisely control the cell environment, perform a large variety of single-cell assays and real-time image each single cell, providing a predictable analytical window into live single-cell biology. We currently offer six types of OptoSelect chips, with different designs and numbers of NanoPens for various workflows. Our largest commercially available chip has 20,000 pens, and is primarily used for our antibody discovery workflow with plasma cells. OptoSelect chips are single-use consumables and replaced after each workflow. 
Table of Contents

Reagent kits 
We have commercialized a broad range of reagent kits that have been validated in the workflows using our platform. These reagent kits support the on-chip analysis on our advanced automation systems as well as many other upstream and downstream processes. 
Our reagent kits have been optimized to support multiple species and cell types including mammalian cells such as B cells, T cells and dendritic cells, and non-mammalian cells including yeast and bacteria. 
Advanced automation systems and instruments
We currently offer three advanced automation systems and instruments, Beacon and Lightning, which are designed to run our proprietary workflows, and Culture Station, which allows our customers to execute workflows requiring high volume, multi-day cell culture without breaking the continuity and control provisions of a single program run. 
Beacon 
Launched in December of 2016, our Beacon system is a fully automated, high throughput system that enables workflows on four OptoSelect chips in parallel, utilizing up to 80,000 NanoPens. Beacon captures brightfield and fluorescence images to track and assay individual cells across multiple points in time to allow deep functional profiling of phenotypic and genotypic information on single cells. Beacon is used by our customers for high throughput applications, including antibody discovery and cell line development. Since its launch, we have focused on continuous improvement efforts in the form of activating additional system-level capabilities and enhancements, in turn, enhancing the value of the system for our customers. We will continue to evolve Beacon to further facilitate distributed decentralized biological processing globally. 
Advanced application and workflow software 
Our software suite includes tailored software packages that enable customers to design, automate and scale reproducible workflows and collect, aggregate, analyze and report data on each cell in each NanoPen, far beyond what we believe is possible with current manual workflows. 
Table of Contents

Our workflow and assay library 
As of December 31, 2022, we offered twelve commercial workflows, incorporating multiple assays that address different phases of our customers’ cell-based product value chains in our target markets. In many of these markets, we are developing additional workflows that can extend use of our platform across our customers’ research and development pipelines. A central theme to all of our workflows is that they enable single-cell functional testing as early as possible in our customers’ respective value chains, allowing them to focus costly scaling efforts only on the biology that is most likely to yield the desired outcome (manufacturing titers, cell therapy function, etc.).  We are also expanding our workflows to enter new cell-based product markets. Workflow development and market expansion are a function of incorporating additional cell types, product specific assays or adapting the four basic workflow modules. 
We use our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, which we believe represents the largest platform capacity globally for functionally characterizing cells, to drive new workflow development and functionally characterize cells. In our BioFoundry, we develop workflows and functional assays across the value chain of our target markets. Leveraging our BioFoundry’s capacity, we can also look deep into the immune repertoire to discover difficult-to-find proprietary biological assets, such as antibodies and TCR sequences with high commercial value.
Through our platform, customers can now link the deep functional profiling data to each cell’s gene expression levels. Alternately, some customers are using our platform to recover the paired heavy and light chains of antibody sequences for B cells that produce viral neutralizing antibodies (linking sequences to neutralization assays performed on our platform for viruses like coronavirus). Others use our platform to capture mRNA to profile gene expression from T cells (linking the genes expressed to the secreted proteins directly measured from those T cells). Customers can also identify which genes are linked to increasing the production of high-value biologics, such as therapeutic antibodies. Such phenotype-to-genotype data is critical to understanding how cells behave, and yet we are aware of no other technology that can link gene expression to cell function with the throughput, precision, and speed of our platform. We expect that customers will be able to use this linked data to improve cellular models which may enable better organism design.

Our Strategy
In the second half of 2022, we announced an updated company-wide strategy, which is centered on the following five key pillars:
1.Generate positive operating cash flow by early 2025. We plan to do this by building a growing, profitable, and sustainable business as opposed to pursuing growth at any cost. We intend to accomplish this through revenue acceleration supported by an updated, market-driven product portfolio and pricing strategy, as well as disciplined expense and cash management. The management team took an initial step to reduce operating costs through a global workforce reduction of approximately 12% in July 2022 and approximately 9% during the first quarter of 2023 (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). 
2.Prioritize Research and Development (“R&D”) return on investment through increased focus and rigor on development initiatives. For example, we exited certain agreements with limited margin benefit to us and our stated preference for prioritizing higher value projects that support our margin and profitability goals. In addition, during 2022, we validated the unique capability on our platform to select and retrieve high-value stable producer cell lines that will improve the cost and therapeutically relevant yields for manufacturing AAV-based gene therapies, which we believe represents a significant return on investment opportunity in the near term. As such, we intend to dedicate a significant number of our resources towards development of this workflow in 2023. 
3.Deliver consistent commercial execution through a new sales structure and enhance product portfolio and pricing strategy. We have completed an in-depth analysis of our markets and unmet customer needs in various segments. We believe our technology can provide significant value in high-growth academic research segments, such as gene editing and immune-oncology applications. We have started to form academic collaboration pilot programs to help inform the design of these new applications.
Beginning in 2023, we intend to launch application-specific models of the Beacon system each year, culminating in the anticipated launch of a low-cost bench top device with segment specific versions in 2025. In 2023, we have launched the Beacon Select and intend to launch the Beacon Quest. We believe broadening our portfolio of platforms will allow us to access a wider array of potential customers in the market with products that are more tailored to their needs and budgets. In addition, we plan on expanding our access programs that offer financing options.
4.Build a world-class leadership team with a proven track record in profitably scaling life sciences tools companies. In the first quarter of 2022 we hired a new chief executive officer, and subsequently made other key executive hires. This leadership team is putting in place processes to shift to a performance-driven culture across the business. These changes are critical to our efforts to effectively scale our business and advance our market position through targeted investment and strong execution. Collectively, the new leadership team has the experience needed to build a diverse life sciences tools and services company.
5.Evaluate merger and acquisition (“M&A”) opportunities that will help us accelerate profitable growth and leverage our current cost structure. We have conducted market research to understand our customers’ unmet needs and competitive dynamics. This research is expected to help us formulate data-driven decisions on what markets to expand into and what inorganic options would be complementary to our business and technology. We expect to pursue synergistic M&A options that expand our serviceable addressable market and/or provide leverage to our Selling, general and administrative and R&D expense structure.
For example, during December 2022, we announced a definitive agreement under which we will acquire IsoPlexis in an all-stock transaction valued at $57.8 million. If the merger closes, we expect the combined company to be renamed PhenomeX, which we believe will be a premier functional cell biology company that provides live cell biology research tools which deliver deep insights into cellular function and new perspectives on phenomes.
Table of Contents

We believe by focusing on these five pillars, we can transform Berkeley Lights from a technology platform company to a diverse life sciences tools and services company. We believe the IsoPlexis transaction, if closed, fully supports the five pillars of our strategic plan, including, among other things, allowing us to achieve positive operating cash flow by 2024. 
Market opportunity 
While our platform is currently utilized primarily in the discovery and development stages of the value chain and marketed as research use only (“RUO”), we believe that the capabilities of our platform will enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of our serviceable addressable market opportunity and the value chain across cell-based product industries, including being incorporated into the commercial manufacturing process. Our current workflows target customers in the antibody therapeutics, cell line development, gene therapies, TCR discoveries and agriculture markets. We believe our serviceable addressable market is approximately $3.1 billion, split roughly equally between our platform and partnership and services opportunities. Our current focus in these areas are antibody discovery, cell line development, immune-oncology, gene editing, AAV stable cell line, TCR discovery and agricultural. Our estimates of our serviceable addressable markets are based on potential customer research and development spending, addressable aspects of potential customers’ end product development process, and potential platform usage. We also utilize estimated penetration and placement rates for our platform with potential customers in our target markets and historical patterns for consumables usage. 
Commercial 
As of December 31, 2022, our customer base was comprised of 96 customers and included several of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, as well as biotechnology companies, leading contract research organizations, synthetic biology companies and academic research institutions. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a commercial team of 101 employees, including 30 with Ph.D. degrees and many with significant industry experience. 
Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform and maximizing its use across our customers’ value chains. This is achieved by enabling more functional testing of single cells throughout our customers’ value chains and by finding opportunities for customers to perform single-cell functional testing earlier in their product development process. We engage with potential customers to identify a significant challenge they are facing and then evaluate which workflows and underlying assays can address their problem. Customers can gain access to our platform via direct purchase, subscription, our service business, or strategic partnership. In many cases we can address customer needs with existing or variants of existing workflows. 
Alternatively, we may form strategic partnerships to develop substantially new workflows with our customers to address their needs. 
Competition 
We face significant competition in the life sciences technology market. We currently compete with both established and early stage life sciences technology companies that design, manufacture and market systems, consumables, reagent kits and software for, among other applications, genomics, single-cell analysis, spatial analysis and immunology, and/or provide services related to the same. Growing understanding of the importance of single-cell information is leading to more companies offering services related to collecting such information. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems, or using traditional methods, or engage a third party that provides a discovery service, rather than implementing our platform, and they may also decide to stop using our platform. Companies providing point solutions in this space include 10x Genomics, HiFiBio Therapeutics, Solentim, Molecular Devices, Cytena, NanoCellect Biomedical, Danaher, Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Miltenyi Biotec, Sphere Fluidics Ltd., Akoya Biosciences, Inc., Cytek Biosciences, Inc., NanoString Technologies, Inc. and Singular Genomics Systems, Inc., among others. In addition, there are many large 
Table of Contents

established players in the life science technology market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop systems, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These large established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. 
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and strategy—The life sciences technology market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.” 
Manufacturing and supply 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to functional cell biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of proprietary consumables, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our OEP technology, which provides deterministic positioning of live single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, live single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. 
Our manufacturing strategy relies heavily on third parties. Manufacturing of our systems, certain of our reagent kits and OptoSelect chip components is contracted out to third party contract manufacturers and suppliers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. We perform final assembly of our OptoSelect chips in-house. Our outsourced production strategy is intended to drive cost leverage and scale and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs related to constructing and operating a manufacturing facility. Certain suppliers of our components and materials are single source suppliers. For further discussion of the risks relating to our third party suppliers, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to manufacturing and supply.” 
Consumables—OptoSelect chips and reagent kits 
We obtain all components of our OptoSelect chips from third party suppliers. While some components are sourced from a single supplier, we have qualified, or are qualifying, second sources for several of our critical chip requirements, as well as our reagent kits, and proprietary chip surface coatings. We believe that having dual sources for certain of our components helps reduce the risk of a potential production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We also perform final manufacturing and assembly of our OptoSelect chips at our facilities in Emeryville, California. We also manufacture many of our commercially released reagent kits and when needed, based on capacity or capability needs, we also outsource the manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers. 
Advanced automation systems and instruments 
We rely heavily on third party contract manufacturers for production and manufacturing of Beacon. Design work, prototyping and pilot manufacturing of our advanced automation systems are performed in-house before outsourcing to the third party contract manufacturers. We currently rely on Korvis LLC (“Korvis”) for the 
Table of Contents

manufacturing of Beacon and Culture Station. For additional information on our supply arrangement with Korvis, see below under “Korvis supply agreement.” 
Korvis supply agreement 
In February of 2015, we entered into a supply agreement with Korvis which was subsequently amended in April of 2019  (collectively, the “Korvis Agreement”). The Korvis Agreement governs the terms and conditions of any purchase orders that we submit to Korvis for the manufacture of Beacon and Culture Station. Under the terms of the Korvis Agreement, Korvis will manufacture our products according to agreed-upon specifications. Korvis is required to maintain minimum manufacturing capacity of a specified number of Beacon systems per month. In addition, we may issue purchase orders in such volumes that require Korvis to maintain at least a specified minimum number of Beacon systems in its finished goods inventory. We are not otherwise obligated to issue a purchase order, and Korvis is only obligated to accept purchase orders for any specified number of products if the purchase order is consistent with a forecast and aligns with Korvis’s then-current lead times. The initial term of the Korvis Agreement was 24 months, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive 12-month terms unless we or Korvis provide written notice of intent not to renew at least 90 days’ prior to the end of the then-current term. 
The Korvis Agreement also includes negotiated provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, intellectual property rights, indemnification, and confidentiality.
Intellectual property 
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We seek to ensure that investments made into the development of our technology are protected by relying on a combination of patent rights, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality agreements and procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights. 
Our patent strategy is focused on seeking coverage for various elements of our Berkeley Lights Platform, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and instruments, including Beacon, Lightning, and Culture Station and advanced application and workflow software. In addition, we file for patent protection on the certain therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes discovered using or derived from the Berkeley Lights Platform. 
As of December 31, 2022, our owned patent assets included approximately 63 U.S. patents, 72 pending U.S. patent applications, 6 pending patent cooperation treaty (“PCT”), applications, 404 foreign patents and 330 pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Our owned patent assets include 17 patents and applications that are jointly owned by us and by the Regents of the University of California (“UC Regents”), including 2 U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 9 foreign patents and 4 foreign patent applications, of which the 2 U.S. patents and the 8 foreign patents are included within the scope of our exclusive licensing arrangement with the UC Regents. As of December 31, 2022, our in-licensed patent assets included 9 U.S. patents, 6 foreign patents, and 1 pending U.S. patent application. Excluding any patent term extension, the currently issued BLI-owned patents are expected to expire between 2033 to 2040. The currently issued in-licensed patents are expected to expire from 2023 to 2033. We do not expect that the expiration or abandonment of any patent in 2023 will materially impact our business, future operations or financial position. 
Various of our owned patents and patent applications relate to our advanced automation systems, including our Beacon, Lightning and/or Culture Station systems and our OEP technology, other of our patents and patent applications relate to our advanced application and workflow software, including our Cell Analysis Suite (“CAS”) software, our Workflow Runner/Builder software, our Image Analyzer software, and/or our Assay Analyzer software, still other of our owned patents and patent applications relate to our OptoSelect chips, and still other of 
Table of Contents

our owned patents and patent applications relate to our reagent kits and/or our workflows. Certain of our owned patents and patent applications relate to more than one product group or technology. Our in-licensed patents and patent applications generally relate to micro opto-fluidics. We also have patents related to products or technology that are under development or are on our development roadmap. 
We also rely on copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as certain processes, methods and surface coatings, are better kept as trade secrets. To mitigate the chance of trade secret misappropriation, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions they have developed while working for us. 
We also seek to protect our brand through procurement of trademark rights. As of December 31, 2022, we owned twelve registered trademarks in the U.S. and 85 registered trademarks internationally, inclusive of Madrid Protocol applications, as well as three U.S. and 34 international pending trademark applications. Such international jurisdictions in which we own registered trademarks or pending trademark applications include Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Our registered trademarks and pending trademark applications include trademarks for Berkeley Lights, BLI, NanoPen, OptoSelect, Beacon, Lightning, Deep Opto Profiling, OEP, CAS, Opto, OptoSeq, and our Berkeley Lights logo. In order to supplement protection of our brand, we have also registered several internet domain names. For further discussion of the risks relating to intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to litigation and our intellectual property.”
Licenses
UC Regents license agreement
In October of 2011, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016 (“UC Agreement”), with the UC Regents, pursuant to which UC Regents granted us an exclusive (subject to certain non-commercial rights reserved by UC Regents and certain rights retained by the U.S. government, including so-called march-in rights), sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned by UC Regents related to optoelectronic tweezer technology to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products, services and methods that are covered by such patent rights, or the Licensed Products.
We paid UC Regents upfront payments totaling $15,000 in connection with executing the UC Agreement. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 250,992 shares of our common stock, which had an aggregate fair value at the time of issuance of approximately $30,000, to certain persons associated with UC Regents upon the occurrence of a qualifying financing event. Additionally, we must pay UC Regents a sub-single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of Licensed Products that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment owed to UC Regents of $10,000. We are also obligated to pay UC Regents a percentage of certain royalty income received from our sublicensees ranging from the low- to mid-teens.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Products.
The UC Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application that is licensed to us, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the UC Agreement. We may terminate the UC Agreement by providing advance written notice as specified in the UC Agreement. UC Regents may terminate the UC Agreement if we violate or fail to perform any term of the UC Agreement and we fail to cure such violation or failure within 90 days of notice thereof from UC Regents. Additionally, if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, UC Regents may remove such patents from the scope of our license.

Government regulations
Our products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices. 
Our products are currently marketed as RUO. RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. 
Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States 
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic devices (“IVDs”). IVDs that are marketed for RUO are not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices more generally, including the requirements for clearance or approval and compliance with manufacturing requirements known as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. 
Although we currently market our products as RUO, we may in the future intend for them to be used for clinical or diagnostic purposes, or may develop other different products intended for clinical or diagnostic purposes, such as our in-development CTMS, which would result in the application of a more onerous set of regulatory requirements. Specifically, unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of an application for premarket approval, or PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees. 
It is also possible that in the future we develop a therapeutic that would be subject to different but also comprehensive FDA regulatory requirements. 
Human capital resources 
As of December 31, 2022 we employed a total of 285 individuals, of whom 249 were employed in the United States and Canada, 19 of whom were employed in Asia Pacific and 17 of whom were employed in Europe. As of December 31, 2022, our 285 full-time employees included 76 in research and development, 101 in business development, sales, marketing and support, 45 in manufacturing and operations and 63 in general and administrative functions, of which many hold PhDs in their respective disciplines. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with us. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract,
