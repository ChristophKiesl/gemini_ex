ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a digital technology company that provides email and collaboration software, cloud-based identity management platforms, managed web and mobile portals, and advertising solutions. Our customers include communications providers, media companies, government entities and enterprises. We are their trusted partner for enterprise software platforms and monetization solutions that we deliver through public and private cloud software-as-a-service, software licensing, and professional services. Our platforms enable our clients to deepen engagement with their consumers and users.
Products and Services
Cloud ID Authentication
Synacor develops and operates a cloud-based identity and access management platform for large enterprises that runs authentication, user lifecycle management and identity security for our customer’s end users when they need to sign-in to online applications and access their services with networked devices.
Consumers access their online services and subscription content using a myriad of devices where many find the login process frustrating. Enterprises are challenged to handle the digital identities of tens of millions of consumers and resiliently unlock access during online events that require thousands of verifications per second, often breaking under the load. 
Synacor Cloud ID managed identity services resiliently scale to handle the largest enterprises without requiring customers to install on-premises identity management systems. Cloud ID simplifies the end user experience by offering native single sign on, home-based authentication and device management to reduce login friction and improve security.
Email/Collaboration
Our open and extensible Email/Collaboration platform is used by service providers, regulated entities (government & financial institutions), enterprises, and small and medium sized businesses around the world. Branded as Zimbra, our open-standards-based Email/Collaboration platform powers hundreds of millions of mailboxes globally through our network of over 1,900 channel partners (value-added resellers, or VARs, and Business Service Providers, or BSPs) and about 4,000 licensed customers. Zimbra is delivered as software-as-a-service through public and private cloud infrastructure, and as licensed software. Our Email/Collaboration Services include white-label hosting, security and migration.
Managed Portals and Advertising
Our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions provide our customers with substantial revenue opportunities generated by their consumers’ engagement across devices. Our Managed Portals are intended to be daily destinations for consumers and are delivered across devices and under our customers’ own brand names. To help our customers increase their consumers’ engagement, we deliver relevant content, such as top news, entertainment, and long and short-form video and apps, on our Managed Portals. We have licensing and distribution agreements with a wide range of programmers and content and service providers. In addition, consumers have the ability through our portals to manage their email and messaging, pay bills, receive special promotions and perform other account management needs.
We monetize the online traffic generated by consumers through search advertising, digital advertising (including video), and syndicated content on our Managed Portals. As we monetize our customers’ online traffic on our Managed Portals, we share a portion of this revenue with our customers, resulting in a mutually beneficial partnership.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is, with operational and financial discipline, to:
•increase value for existing customers by optimizing consumer experience and monetization;
•innovate on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services;
•win new customers in current and related verticals; and
•extend our product portfolio into emerging growth areas.

Innovating on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services
Our Cloud ID Authentication platform is reported as having some of the highest consumer login success rates in the industry.
In 2017, we expanded our Cloud ID relationships with content providers, service providers, OTT players, and device manufacturers. We delivered Authentication services for HBO GO, providing, for example, authentication in connection with the Game of Thrones’ record-breaking seventh season premiere.  Additionally, Apple uses Synacor’s Authentication services to support Apple Single Sign-On. The current wave of multichannel video programming distributors, or MVPDs, launched by Apple are almost all running on Synacor’s Cloud ID Advanced Authentication platform. Our Authentication services also support two of the top four OTT players including Sling TV and YouTube TV, simplifying the consumer log-in experience.
Winning new customers in current and related verticals
We have an established presence among broadband and pay-TV providers in the U.S. and Canada. Some of these providers use our complete suite of solutions, and others use only certain components. We view this as a growth opportunity within our existing customer base.
In 2019, Synacor added 380 new Zimbra Email and Collaboration Suite enterprise and government customers around the world.
Increasing value for existing customers by optimizing user experience and monetization
With respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, more than 95% of our customers’ consumers have upgraded to our latest-generation portal. Our portal, with its engaging user experience and responsive design for desktop and mobile web, and our mobile apps, have video threaded throughout and is designed to optimize consumer engagement and monetization. We are also decreasing the implementation time for customers to launch our latest-generation portal.
Extending our product portfolio into emerging growth areas
We plan to capitalize on opportunities such as international expansion and delivery of business services. Through our acquisition of the Zimbra assets we have expanded our international customer base, and we believe this represents an opportunity to find new customers for our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions.
Technology and Operations
Technology Architecture
Our products leverage technology that is reliable, fault tolerant and scalable through the addition of more servers as usage grows. In 2019 we invested heavily in providing these same capabilities using public cloud technologies. In addition to the existing reliable/fault tolerant infrastructure, cloud technologies enable us to provide self-healing software, auto-scaling, and automated deployments.
Data Center Facilities
We currently operate and maintain five data centers in regionally diverse locations and have a network operations center that is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our primary data centers are located in shared facilities in Allen, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Lewis Center, Ohio; Toronto, Canada; and Watertown, Massachusetts. All systems are fully monitored for reporting continuity and fault isolation. The data centers are each in a physically secure facility using monitoring, environmental alarms, closed circuit television and redundant power sources. Our network operations center also is located in a secure facility.

Customers
Our recurring and fee-based customers consist of high-speed internet service providers along with enterprises, government and nonprofit organizations, either directly or through resellers. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of one to three years and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. Our recurring and fee-based customer contracts also typically contain service level agreements that call for specific system “up times” and 24 hours per day, seven days per week support. As of December 31, 2019, we had agreements, both directly and indirectly through resellers, with over 120 high-speed internet service providers and over 4,000 enterprise, government and nonprofit customers. 
Our Managed Portals and Advertising customers principally consist of high-speed internet service providers, such as Windstream, Mediacom and CenturyLink. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of two to three years from the deployment of our Managed Portals and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. 
Content and Service Providers
We license the content available in our Managed Portals, as well as premium services, from numerous third-party content and service partners. These partners provide a variety of content, including news and information, entertainment, video, games, shopping, travel, and finance. Our relationships with content providers give consumers access to over five hundred thousand articles and one million short-form videos each month. To obtain this content, we enter into a variety of licensing arrangements with the content providers. These arrangements are typically one to two years in duration with payment terms that may be based on traffic, advertising revenue share, number of subscribers, flat fee payments over time, or some combination thereof. In addition to using licensed content to populate our Managed Portals, we also provide premium services that subscribers may purchase for additional fees. As of December 31, 2019, we had arrangements with dozens of content providers, such as The Associated Press, AOL, Gracenote, The Sporting News and Video Elephant.
Sales and Marketing
Email/Collaboration
We market our Email/Collaboration product through both direct and indirect sales channels. Our regional sales and marketing teams host several events each year with partners and run various campaigns to generate sales leads. Once a lead has been identified, our internal sales representatives work closely with our regional partners on better identifying the opportunity and gathering customer requirements.
We sell to internet service providers primarily through a direct sales force consisting of regional account executives. Sales cycles can be six months or longer. We sell to prospective government, nonprofit and enterprise customers through a two-tier indirect model via more than 2,500 channel partners (VARs and BSPs). Our VARs sell on-premise licenses to end customers while our BSPs sell a cloud service to the end customer. Sales cycles can range from thirty days to six months, depending on size and scope.
Managed Portals and Advertising Solutions
Synacor’s managed portal network and publisher-focused advertising platform reaches over 200 million monthly unique visitors. Our advertising solutions enable our customers to earn incremental revenue by monetizing media from their consumers across all popular devices.
Our advertising sales team sells advertising inventory directly to advertisers and/or to advertising agencies representing those advertisers, as well as employing programmatic ad monetization strategies utilizing ad exchanges via real-time bidding. These advertisers may be small companies with the advertising locally or regionally focused on the Managed Portals of one customer, or large companies with nationwide advertising on the Managed Portals of many customers as well as on our syndicated group of publishers’ sites. We have a team of direct advertising sales employees, independent advertising sales representatives, and programmatic ad specialists focused on this effort and will continue to develop this team and attempt to grow the amount of advertising revenue generated with our customers. As of December 31, 2019, we had arrangements with over 100 advertising partners such as Rubicon, AppNexus, Comcast Spotlight, Criteo, DoubleClick, Progressive Insurance, and Telaria.

Managed Portals
Our managed portal network consists of white-labeled browser start pages and iOS/Android start apps that serve as daily destinations for consumers. Powered by our media and programming library which includes news, entertainment, and short and long form video, these products increase consumer engagement and generate advertising revenue. They also provide consumers with self-management capabilities for email and messaging, bill paying and other account management activities.
Syndicated Advertising
Synacor’s syndicated advertising platform works with hundreds of publishers to deliver brand-safe monetization that leverages scale, premium brands and programmatic technology across desktop and mobile. We help publishers dynamically target different audiences by matching relevant content to the right users across multiple devices. Publishers also leverage our demand facilitation services to connect premium advertisers and brands with their target audiences on brand-safe sites.
Government Regulation
We generally are not regulated other than under international, federal, state and local laws applicable to the internet or e-commerce or to businesses in general. Some regulatory authorities have enacted or proposed specific laws and regulations governing the internet and online entertainment. These laws and regulations cover issues such as taxation, pricing, content, distribution, quality and delivery of services and products, electronic contracts, intellectual property rights, user privacy and information security.
Federal laws regarding the internet that could have an impact on our business include the following: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers of third-party content, including content that may infringe copyrights or rights of others; the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, which requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
There are numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and guidelines around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, destruction and security of personal information and other subscriber data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, at both the federal and state levels, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect on January 1, 2020 and requires companies to provide new data disclosure, access and deletion rights to California consumers, afford such consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and impose significant penalties for non-compliance or data breaches. It remains unclear how the legislation will be interpreted. The California Attorney General’s office will enforce the statute as of July 1, 2020. 
The United States Department of Commerce designed the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield with the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, in order to facilitate (but do not, alone, constitute) compliance with certain of the applicable data protection requirements under the GDPR. We initially certified compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield in December 2016 and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield in June 2017 and renew our certifications on an annual basis, but whether Privacy-Shield certification will continue to be a valid means to transfer European data to the United States is uncertain.
Table of Contents

We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent possible. Laws such as the GDPR, the CCPA or other user privacy or security laws could require us to incur additional expenditures for compliance, result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, loss of access to data transfer mechanisms or litigation, restrict our and our customers’ ability to market products to their consumers, create uncertainty in internet usage and reduce the demand for our services and products or require us to make changes to our data and security practices and our services and products, including Managed Portals.
Intellectual Property
We believe that the protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on copyright, trademark and patent enforcement, contractual restrictions and trade secret, trade dress and domain name laws to protect our brand and other proprietary and intellectual property rights. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements and other agreements containing confidentiality protections with certain parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets, confidential information, know-how and technical information. We have applied for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property.  In addition, we have acquired intellectual property, including patents and trademarks, through our acquisitions including Zimbra, Technorati, NimbleTV and Teknision. We have three trademark registrations in the United States for SYNACOR (U.S. Registration Numbers 5108679, 2845578 and 2811272).
We endeavor to protect our internally-developed systems and maintain our trademarks. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by United States and international copyright laws.
In addition to legal protections, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product support and services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Competition
The market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is highly competitive and involves rapidly-changing technologies and customer and consumer requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. While we believe that our technology offers considerable value and flexibility to our customers by helping them to extend their consumer relationships to a wide variety of internet-based services, we face competition at four levels:
•When one of our prospective or existing customers considers another supplier, including one of our partners, for elements of the services or products which we provide.
•When consumers choose to rely on other vendors for similar products and services.
•When content and service providers prefer to establish direct relationships with one or more of our customers.
•When one of our customers decides to make the significant headcount and technology investment to develop products and services in-house similar to those that we provide.
Our technology competes primarily with high-speed internet service providers that have internal information technology staff capable of developing similar solutions in-house.
Email/Collaboration
With respect to our Email/Collaboration solutions, we compete primarily with Google and Microsoft in the enterprise and government markets, and with Open-Xchange and OpenWave in the internet service provider markets.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the email/collaboration market include a company’s ability to:
•provide customers the ability to perform security and compliance audits of our source code;
•deliver anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-virus and encryption technologies;
•provide products and services at lowest possible total cost of ownership (TCO);
•provide local partners the ability to store data within the legal jurisdiction of the country where their customers do business;
Table of Contents

•provide an enterprise-ready solution suitable for large-scale deployments including such enterprise features such as delegated administration, detailed logging, and performance and availability transparency;
•offer access to real-time performance and availability statistics;
•afford customers and partners the ability to rebrand their cloud collaboration experience; and
•make available to partners both integrations and extensions to the collaboration cloud environment specific to customers’ needs.
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in several ways. First, we offer our Email/Collaboration products and services a la carte, enabling customers to buy only the services they need, providing for a much lower TCO. Second, our Zimbra Email/Collaboration solution is a complete feature-rich, enterprise-ready solution scalable up to 40 million mailboxes. Finally, our products are customizable and extendable and designed to meet very high standards of security.
Managed Portals and Advertising Solutions
In addition, with respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, we compete with companies such as Facebook, Inc.; Google; Verizon Media; and MSN, a division of Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft, which have destination websites of their own or are capable of delivering content, service offerings and search or advertising models similar to ours.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include a company’s ability to:
•reinforce the brands of our cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics customers;
•produce products that are flexible and easy to use;
•offer competitive fees for Managed Portal development and operation;
•generate additional revenue for our customers;
•enable our customers to be involved in designing the “look and feel” of their online presence;
•offer services and products that meet the changing needs of our customers and their consumers, including emerging technologies and standards;
•provide high-quality product support to assist the customer’s service representatives; and
•aggregate content to deliver more compelling bundled packages of paid content.
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in three principal ways. First, we provide a white-label solution that, unlike the co-branded approach of most of our competitors, creates a consumer experience that reinforces our customers’ and partners’ brands. Second, we give customers control over the sign-on process and billing function for a wide range of internet services and content by integrating with their internal systems (where applicable) thereby allowing our customers to “own the consumer.” Finally, our solutions are flexible and neutral, meaning that we allow deliverables that are customized to our customers’ specific needs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 257 employees in the United States and 153 based internationally. Of these employees, 320 were full-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
