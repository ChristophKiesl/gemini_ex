Item 1.   Business
 
Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the “Company”), a Texas corporation incorporated in 1965, is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two reportable segments: coil products and tubular products. Significant financial information relating to the Company’s business segments for the last two years is contained in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in Item 8 hereof.
 
Coil Products 
 
The coil product segment consists of the operation of two hot-rolled coil processing facilities; one in Hickman, Arkansas (“Hickman”) and the other in Decatur, Alabama (“Decatur”). The Hickman facility operates a temper mill and a cut-to-length line. The temper mill improves the flatness and surface qualities of the coils and the cut-to-length line levels the steel and cuts the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. The Hickman facility is capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 14 gauge to ½” thick in widths ranging from 36” wide to 72” wide. The Decatur facility previously operated a temper mill and a cut-to-length line but during the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the equipment was removed to allow the foundation to be prepared for a new stretcher leveler line. In March 2021, the new stretcher leveler line was placed into service. The estimated total cost of this project is $7,200,000 with approximately $6,733,000 having been paid as of March 31, 2021. The new equipment expands the coil segment’s processing capabilities to include material up to 96” wide and material of higher grades and will allow the Decatur facility to cut material that is up to ½” thick compared to the previous equipment’s capability of 5/16” thick. In addition, sheet and plate that has been stretcher leveled is preferable to some customers and applications compared to material that has been leveled through the temper mill process. The coil product segment sells its prime grade inventory under the Friedman Industries name but also maintains an inventory of non-standard coil products, consisting primarily of mill secondary and excess prime coils, which are sold through the Company’s XSCP division. The coil product segment also processes customer-owned coils on a fee basis. 
 
The Hickman and Decatur facilities are substantially similar with respect to products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at both facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. Coil products are sold on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail.
 
On May 25, 2021, the Company announced plans for a new facility in Sinton, Texas that will be part of the coil product segment. The new facility will be on the campus of Steel Dynamics, Inc.'s ("SDI") new flat roll steel mill currently under construction in Sinton, Texas. The Company's new location will consist of an approximately 70,000 square foot building located on approximately 26.5 acres leased from SDI under a 99-year agreement. The Company has selected Red Bud Industries to build one of the world’s largest stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines, capable of handling material up to 1” thick, widths up to 96” and yields exceeding 100,000 psi. The Company expects the location to commence operations in April 2022 and estimates the total cost of the project to be $21 million.
 
The coil segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Tubular Products 
 
The tubular product segment consists of the Company’s Texas Tubular Products division (“TTP”) located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter (“OD”) size range of 2 3/8” OD to 8 5/8” OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute (“API”) licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. TTP has an API licensed pipe finishing facility that threads and couples oil country tubular goods and performs other services that are customary in the pipe finishing process. The pipe finishing facility is currently idled due to market conditions. TTP’s inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods. Raw material inventory consists of hot-rolled steel coils that TTP will manufacture into pipe. Finished goods inventory consists of pipe TTP has manufactured and mill reject pipe that TTP purchased from U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc.
 
TTP purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
