Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging endogenous metabolic modulators, or EMMs, to pioneer a new approach for treating complex diseases and improving health. Our product candidates are comprised of multiple EMMs that are engineered in distinct combinations and ratios with the goal of simultaneously impacting multiple biological pathways. Our pipeline includes lead therapeutic candidates for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy, or OHE, recurrence. Additional muscle- and blood-related programs are in earlier-stage development. 
Using our development platform, we have efficiently designed a pipeline of product candidates that are comprised of amino acids and their derivatives. These orally administered compositions are designed to have the potential for multifactorial effects, and their constituents have a general history of safe use.
Once we design a product candidate, we decide whether to initially evaluate it in (i) a non-investigational new drug application, or non-IND, Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical study under U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, regulations and guidance supporting research with food (as noted herein, the term food also includes dietary supplements) or (ii) in a clinical trial under an IND. In this Annual Report, we refer to our non-IND Clinical Studies as “Clinical Studies” and our planned IND-enabled Clinical Trials as “Clinical Trials.” A Clinical Study allows us to evaluate a product candidate’s safety, tolerability and permissible secondary endpoints (e.g. impact on normal structures and functions of the body, including metabolic pathways), before we determine the next steps in its development. Our Clinical Studies are conducted at reputable medical centers following Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, including IRB approval and monitoring, by qualified investigators, including key opinion leaders in their fields. Subsequent development options for a product candidate we initially investigate in a Clinical Study include but are not limited to conducting future research in a Clinical Trial for an identified therapeutic indication, continuing research in another Clinical Study, out-licensing the product candidate, or terminating development.
In 2018, we completed three Clinical Studies. In all three studies, our product candidates were found to be generally well tolerated, and we generated structure and function biomarker data suggesting clinically relevant changes in liver and muscle metabolic pathways. We believe our ability to generate these human data at an early stage of development via initial Clinical Studies (i) significantly reduces the translational uncertainty typically seen when transitioning from animal studies to human studies, (ii) enables us to make high-insight, capital-efficient product candidate development decisions and (iii) for product candidates we initially research in Clinical Studies and subsequently decide to investigate for potential therapeutic indications, increases their probability of Clinical Trial success. 
We currently have three Clinical Studies underway:
•AXA1665-002: A placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm study assessing the impact of two doses of AXA1665 on safety, tolerability and structure/function secondary endpoints in approximately 60 subjects with mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency;
•AXA1125-003: A placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm study assessing the impact of AXA1125 and two doses AXA1957 on safety, tolerability and structure/function secondary endpoints in approximately 105 adult subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD; and
•AXA4010-001: A sequential and staged cohort study assessing the impact of AXA4010 on safety, tolerability and blood structure/function secondary endpoints in approximately 24 subjects (up to 16 adults and eight adolescents) with sickle cell disease.

In March 2020, as a result of resource reallocations at clinical sites from clinical studies and trials toward COVID-19 detection and treatment, enrollment and dosing in our AXA1957-002 pediatric Clinical Study was temporarily suspended. AXA1957-002 is a placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm Clinical Study assessing the impact of one dose of AXA1957 on safety, tolerability and structure/function secondary endpoints in approximately 30 adolescent subjects with fatty liver. 
Based in part on our Clinical Study results to date, along with other relevant information, in 2019, we decided to pursue future development for AXA1665 and AXA1125/AXA1957 in Clinical Trials, subject to data readouts from ongoing Clinical Studies and FDA allowance of INDs, to study their potential to modulate key pathogenic pathways associated with OHE and NASH. As a result, in 2019 we declared AXA1665, AXA1125 and AXA1957 as our first therapeutic product candidates. We have yet to make a development decision for our other product candidates, AXA2678 and AXA4010.
On March 6, 2019, we had a face-to-face pre-IND meeting with the FDA for AXA1665 during which we discussed clinical endpoints, assessment tools and other matters relating to a potential IND-opening Clinical Trial for AXA1665 in the complications of cirrhosis, including hepatic encephalopathy, or HE, and sarcopenia or muscle wasting in cirrhosis. Based on FDA comments received at this meeting, we believe that additional toxicology work would not be required prior to commencing a Clinical Trial for AXA1665. Assuming supportive data from our ongoing Clinical Study of AXA1665 and FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a potential Phase 2b/3 registrational Clinical Trial in the fourth quarter of 2020. We anticipate interacting with the FDA again in 2020 prior to a formal IND submission for AXA1665.
About Endogenous Metabolic Modulators (EMMs)
EMMs encompass a broad set of molecular families, including amino acids, bile acids other intermediary substrates and hormones. Together, these molecules can serve as master regulators and signaling agents, driving multiple pathways to elicit multifactorial effects that integrate basic cellular functioning to impact fundamental biologies. Such biologies include cellular bioenergetics (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain), nutrient handling (e.g., de novo lipogenesis, or metabolic formation of fat, gluconeogenesis, or the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates, and proteogenesis, or protein formation), nutrient sensing via master regulators (e.g., via mammalian target of rapamycin, or mTOR, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, or PPARs), immune response and inflammation, reactive oxygen response, vascular function, neurotransmitter signaling, tissue repair, and autophagy.
Metabolic dysregulation results from a disruption in human homeostasis that is core to optimal functioning and consequently, health. Maintenance of this equilibrium requires an orchestration of multiple metabolic pathways and inter-organ signaling, evolved over billions of years, and is carried out by signaling intermediates and endogenous mediators. EMMs are a critical subset of such endogenous elements that regulate metabolic function.
The loss of homeostasis can be manifested in many conditions and complex diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, or T2D, NASH/NAFLD, and muscle atrophy. As an example, dysregulation in the metabolic processes and pathways controlled by the liver such as de novo lipogenesis or gluconeogenesis can lead to an inability to adequately handle fuel substrates such as fats or carbohydrates. This ultimately results in fatty liver, insulin resistance and buildup of toxic waste products, such as ammonia. Similarly, a complex cascade of fuel dysregulation within skeletal muscles, a key organ involved in glucose disposal and utilization of amino acids as substrates for protein synthesis, can result in insulin resistance, intramuscular fat infiltration and muscle mass loss, thus decreasing muscle function. Muscle mass loss, or sarcopenia, is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of end organ function linked to clinical outcomes and overall survival, such as in end-stage liver disease (cirrhotic sarcopenia) or in end-stage renal disease (uremic sarcopenia).

Consequently, restoring homeostasis and healthy metabolism benefits from a multifactorial approach. We believe that our EMM compositions have the potential to address systems-wide metabolic dysregulation to restore, improve, support and/or maintain homeostasis. In recent decades, extensive data have been generated demonstrating amino acids’ role as fundamental building blocks of life. More recently, their roles in nutrient sensing and cellular signaling have been elucidated not only with individual amino acids, such as a leucine sensor on mTOR, but also in combinations. Additionally, amino acids have a long history of general safe use in foods and dietary supplements. We believe our approach in developing EMM compositions has the potential to bring about a transformation in treating complex diseases and/or supporting health.
Our EMM Composition Design and Nonclinical Research Approach
Design Approach
Our development platform allows us to efficiently design and test EMM compositions that simultaneously target multiple biologies and metabolic pathways. This platform integrates advanced analytics of metabolic regulation and dysregulation to interrogate data in our proprietary databases, which we refer to as Axcella Database, or AxcellaDB, and Axcella Knowledge Base, or AxcellaKB. Our human primary cell systems also directly test the multiple biologies that are particularly disease-related and drive metabolic dysregulation. All of this is supported by what we believe to be the world’s leading EMM safety database. The data and learnings generated through this process further inform our design methodology, increasing our development platform's efficiency for the development of subsequent product candidates.
AxcellaDB, our proprietary database, synthesizes a combination of data from published scientific and medical literature, our in vitro models, and our human Clinical Studies. Through advanced analytics, we investigate novel, causal connections among EMMs, biology, health and disease. We believe this enables us to take a systems biology approach to product candidate discovery and development. Ultimately, we envision utilizing AxcellaKB and its internal machine learning capabilities to identify EMM compositions, predict their effects on biology and identify new target areas for our platform.
Nonclinical Research
We test EMM compositions and hypothesized synergies in normal and disease-specific human primary cell models. We conduct our model systems in environments that aim to simulate physiological levels of biofluids and nutrients. These models include multiple cell types that we use to deconstruct dysregulated metabolism or disease conditions to isolate effects of EMM compositions on subsets of metabolic pathways. The throughput of these models enables us to test product candidates as well as combinations of the individual constituents to identify and better understand their interactions.
Pharmacokinetic, or PK, literature, experiments and modeling inform our EMM compositions (i.e. amounts and ratios). We are able to evaluate EMM plasma exposure, supra-physiological exposures, windows of exposure administration amounts, the characterization of critical PK behaviors across molecule classes, and the implications of physiological compartmental distribution. We believe these data can be used to refine product candidate designs.
Our Clinical Approach and Development Path Decision Making
Once a product candidate is designed, we then decide whether to evaluate the candidate in a Clinical Study or under a Clinical Trial. To date, we have initially conducted clinical investigations of our product candidates in Clinical Studies. Going forward, we may conduct initial clinical investigations of future product candidates under Clinical Trials.
Table of Contents

We conduct our Clinical Studies under the FDA's September 2013 Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs entitled "Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND ," which we believe allows for Clinical Studies to be conducted to assess a food product’s safety, tolerability and effect on normal structures or functions in humans in healthy and diseased subjects. Our current product candidates comprise amino acids and their derivatives, which may be deemed generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in Clinical Studies. We select the amounts of the amino acids and derivatives used in our product candidates based upon doses previously found in third-party clinical studies and third-party clinical trials to be tolerable with no significant safety concerns. Therefore, we believe we can study our product candidates in Clinical Studies as food and dietary supplements. See “FDA regulation of conventional food” for further information.
Our Clinical Studies include a substantial number of biomarkers that may inform biologies relevant to the healthy structures and functions of the body but are not designed or intended to evaluate a product candidate’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease or other health condition. They are conducted at reputable medical centers following GCPs, including IRB approval and monitoring, by qualified investigators, including key opinion leaders in their fields. Using a combination of data from these Clinical Studies and/or other relevant information, we decide whether to advance the product candidate’s development in a therapeutic path under a Clinical Trial, further research the product candidate in another Clinical Study, out-license commercialization rights to the product candidate, or terminate its development. We may decide to partner with other companies in the development or commercialization of our product candidates.
In 2019, we determined that our lead compounds, AXA1665, AXA1125 and AXA1957, will be pursued as therapeutic product candidates, meaning that subject to final data readouts from ongoing Clinical Studies and FDA allowance of INDs, any future assessment of these product candidates will be made in Clinical Trials. These Clinical Trials would therefore be designed to evaluate each product candidate’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent targeted diseases (OHE for AXA1665 and NASH for AXA1125 and AXA1957). 
Our Therapeutic Pipeline
We have developed a wholly-owned therapeutic pipeline currently consisting of three product candidates. An overview of these product candidates and their development status is illustrated below.
1. Initial Clinical Studies refers to Non-IND Clinical Studies initiated prior to a development path decision. 
2. Planned Clinical Trial, contingent upon final data readouts from ongoing Clinical Studies and allowance by the FDA.
3. Indication expected to be reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence.
4. We believe that this has the potential to serve as a registrational Clinical Trial, contingent upon final data readout from ongoing Clinical Study and allowance by the FDA.

AXA1665 for the Reduction in Risk of Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy (OHE) Recurrence
The initial proposed indication for an AXA1665 Clinical Trial is expected to be for the reduction in risk of OHE recurrence in adult patients with liver cirrhosis. We expect the proposed primary endpoint for our Clinical Trial to be time to breakthrough episode of OHE. We expect our proposed key secondary endpoints to be assessments related to physical function. We expect to discuss our proposed trial design and endpoints with the FDA in 2020.
About OHE and Cirrhosis
Long-term damage to the liver from various causes, such as alcohol, hepatitis B or C viral infections, NASH or autoimmune hepatitis, can lead to permanent scarring, a condition called cirrhosis. Prevalence of cirrhosis in the United States is approximately 0.27%, corresponding to approximately 633,000 adults, of which 69% reported that they were unaware of having liver disease. Decompensated cirrhosis is a serious systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in a variety of significant complications, including HE, bacterial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment and ascites, which is the build-up of excess fluid in the abdomen. Transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis occurs at a rate of approximately 5% to 7% per year.
HE is one of the most common complications of cirrhosis with multiple contributing factors, such as amino acid imbalance, ammonia toxicity, muscle wasting, infections and constipation, all of which ultimately result in diminished brain function. Emerging data suggest that muscle mass and function are key independent factors associated with progression to and severity of HE. It is estimated that up 40% to 60% of cirrhosis subjects have sarcopenia and, separately, 40% have HE symptoms. OHE refers to the presence of neurological abnormalities that are clinically apparent and do not require specialized psychometric testing. By contrast, minimal, or covert, HE is less severe and requires specialized testing for its diagnosis, including psychometric tests. OHE is well-established as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the cirrhotic population and is an area that continues to have unmet medical needs.
Furthermore, muscle depletion and muscle fat infiltration occurring during cirrhosis independently increase the risk of both overt and minimal HE with increased mortality. Decline in muscle mass can also hamper the alternative pathway of ammonia detoxification, and hyperammonemia may further worsen sarcopenia, generating a vicious cycle. The highly interdependent complications of cirrhosis, sarcopenia and HE, constitute a significant disease burden and can have an impact on irreversible morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. We estimate that approximately 63,000 to 130,000 individuals may be affected at any given time with both cirrhotic sarcopenia and OHE in the United States.
While there are three approved therapies for HE, there is still a need for additional HE treatment options, particularly those that have the potential to address the systemic complications of cirrhosis, including frailty.
Design of AXA1665
AXA1665 is a composition of eight amino acids and derivatives that is designed to target multiple metabolic pathways intersecting key organ systems (liver, muscle and gut) key to support and maintain liver health.

Underlying Biology | AXA1665 Design Objectives 
Plasma amino acid imbalance | Maximize proteogenesis and reduce systemic aromatic amino acids 
Dysregulated ammonia handling | Stimulate urea cycle function, intestinal and renal nitrogen metabolism, and induce intramuscular ammonia detoxification
Muscle wasting | Increase muscle protein synthesis by addressing metabolic demand and stimulating mTORC1

Completed Clinical Study AXA1665-001
AXA1665-001 was a two-part, 15-day controlled crossover Clinical Study with 23 adult subjects designed to assess AXA1665’s safety, tolerability and impact on normal liver structure and function in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class A and B). The study included two doses of AXA1665 (44.1g/day and 14.7g/day).
Study design for AXA1665-001.
AXA1665 was found to be generally well tolerated in the study. There were no product-related adverse events, or AEs, observed in Part 1 of the study. No AEs were serious or led to discontinuation from the study. There were five AEs, specifically neck pain, posterior shoulder pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, rib pain and headache, observed in four subjects in Part 2, all of which were considered unlikely to be related to AXA1665. All of the AEs resolved spontaneously, including GERD, which self-resolved within a day. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs or standard safety clinical laboratory parameters.
Most AXA1665 constituent amino acids, or AAs, demonstrated dose-dependent systemic exposures. At Day 15, fasted Fischer (branched-chain AA to aromatic AA) and valine-to-phenylalanine ratios, or FR and VPR respectively, dose-dependently increased (AXA1665 14.7g three times per day, or TID, control-adjusted change: 44.3±2.7% and 47.2±3.9%, respectively; p<0.0001). Despite provision of additional nitrogen with AXA1665 14.7g TID, mean fasted plasma ammonia concentration at Day 15 decreased by 21.1% versus 3.8% (control). AXA1665 14.7g TID produced a leaner body composition (decreased percentage body fat and increased percentage lean body mass) coupled with significantly decreased Liver Frailty Index, or LFI, at Day 15 versus control (−0.70±0.15 vs −0.14±0.17; p<0.05).

Enrollment in AXA1665-002 was completed in February 2020, and AXA1665 continues to be generally safe and well tolerated through week 12 to date. Top-line data from this Clinical Study is anticipated in the third quarter of 2020.
AXA1125 and AXA1957 for Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
Given the significant unmet need in NASH, the data that we generated from our non-clinical studies and Clinical Studies and the potential of multifactorial interventions using EMMs in liver disease, we made the decision in 2019 to develop AXA1125 and/or AXA1957 as therapeutic candidates for NASH. As such, our intent is to conduct any subsequent clinical investigations of these product candidates under IND, subject to final data readouts from ongoing

Clinical Studies and input from the FDA. Following the completion of our AXA1125-003 Clinical Study, we expect to engage with the FDA to discuss next steps in this program.
About NAFLD and NASH
We anticipate seeking an initial indication for AXA1125 and/or AXA1957 for the treatment of noncirrhotic NASH. While the pathologies of NAFLD and NASH manifest primarily in the liver, they are systemic diseases driven by multifactorial systemic dysregulation of pathways associated with metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Dysfunctional lipid metabolism associated with insulin resistance and hepatocyte lipotoxicity increases liver cell death. Systemic and chronic inflammation at the cellular and cytokine level drives tissue damage and activates fibrogenic pathways. Activation of stellate cells then causes accumulation of collagen in the liver and leads to progressive fibrosis. 
NAFLD is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States. It is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver, typically resulting from obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. NAFLD in children is often more severe than in adults.
NAFLD can progress to NASH, which is characterized by necroinflammation and fibrosis, and may ultimately lead to life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, requiring liver transplant. With a U.S. prevalence of over 15 million people and a similar prevalence in the five major European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), NASH represents a substantial public health issue and a substantial burden on the overall healthcare system. Incidence is expected to continue increasing in parallel with the obesity and T2D epidemics.
A combination of dietary modifications and increased physical activity remains the standard of care for management of NAFLD and NASH. Currently, there are no approved drug therapies for NASH. 
The potential exists for the first U.S. approval of a NASH therapy, obeticholic acid, or OCA, in 2020, and other potential therapies are in various earlier stages of development. To date, most compounds in development have focused on single key targets within metabolic, inflammation or fibrosis pathways. Few, however, have demonstrated statistical significance in the FDA’s approved endpoints, which are steatohepatitis resolution with no worsening of fibrosis or improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis. As a result, clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly evaluating combination approaches to address the broad spectrum of the disease, improve response rates and expand the size of the treatable population. Significant challenges to this approach include the potential compounding of overlapping side effect profiles and high development and treatment costs.
Additionally, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments and few pipeline programs targeting pediatric NASH. Recommended treatment guidelines for this population currently center around lifestyle interventions.
Design of AXA1125 and AXA1957
AXA1125 is a product candidate that contains six amino acids and derivatives. AXA1957 is a product candidate that contains seven amino acids and derivatives. Both product candidates were designed to target multiple metabolic pathways intersecting key organ systems (liver, muscle and gut) to support and maintain liver health. We believe they may ultimately have the potential to impact hepatic histology by simultaneously influencing multiple pathways that affect metabolism, inflammation and fibrogenesis as summarized in the table below. 
Table of Contents


Underlying Biology | AXA1125/1957 Design Objectives 
Metabolism | Lower lipotoxicity, improve insulin sensitivity and maximize mitochondrial function by enhancing fatty acid beta-oxidation via activation of pathways such as PPARα and AMPK
Inflammation | Modulate apoptosis, macrophage function, reduce hepatic inflammatory mediators and improve gut epithelial integrity 
Fibrosis | Reduce hepatic stellate cell activation and proliferation and decrease hepatic fibrogenesis by downregulating certain pathways, including TGFβ and Hif1α 

Completed Clinical Study AXA1125-001
AXA1125-001 was a two-part Clinical Study to assess safety, tolerability and to secondarily explore pharmacokinetics of AXA1125 in normal healthy adult subjects. Part 1 included ten subjects administered a single 24g amount of AXA1125 either 30 minutes before meal (fasted), 30 minutes after meal (fed) or two hours after meal (fed) to assess the effect of meal timing on plasma concentration and exposure of AXA1125 amino acid constituents. Part 2 included ten subjects administered 24g TID (72g/day) for six weeks to assess the safety and tolerability at these amounts over this duration in healthy subjects.
In both Parts 1 and 2, we did not observe any significant safety issues with AXA1125, and it was generally well tolerated with no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs or ECGs. There were no product-related AEs in Part 1. In Part 2, mild gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, distention and diarrhea were noted in three of ten subjects that was considered by the study investigator to be study product-related. All AEs were transient, self-limited and resolved with no intervention, and none were serious or led to discontinuation.
The PK data suggested normal PK of the complex amino acid mixture with all of the constituents achieving supra-physiologic concentrations as well as no meaningful impact of meal timing on the amino acid profiles. Average peak amino acid plasma concentrations, or Cmax, and total exposure, or AUC, values were generally similar (within 20% to 30%) and sequentially increased with each AXA1125 consumption regardless of meal timing, with the exception of glutamine. Consumption of AXA1125 in the fed state, either 30 minutes or two hours after a meal, resulted in a 1.1 to 2.5-fold increased AUC of glutamine relative to when AXA1125 was consumed in the fasted state.
Completed Clinical Study AXA1125-002
AXA1125-002 was a pilot single-arm, open-label, 12-week (with a two-week follow-up) multicenter Clinical Study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and normal liver structure and function impact of AXA1125 24g TID (72g/day) in 32 NAFLD adult subjects with T2D. 
Study design for AXA1125-002.
Table of Contents

All 32 subjects were included in the safety analysis as all received at least one dose of AXA1125. There were four subjects who received AXA1125 6g TID. A subgroup (n=23) was examined who (i) had received the intended amount of AXA1125 (i.e. 24g TID), (ii) had >10% liver fat at baseline (day 1) by magnetic resonance imaging based assessment of proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and (iii) were compliant and met all the protocol requirements, i.e. the per protocol group. 
We did not observe any significant safety issues with AXA1125, and it was generally well tolerated. Among subjects who received at least one dose of AXA1125, the most common product-related AEs were diarrhea in seven (21.9%) subjects, and headaches in five (15.6%) subjects, which were all mild or moderate. There were two serious AEs reported, acute cholecystitis and right toe infection, which were deemed not to be reasonably associated with the study product, and more likely due to subject's preexisting conditions as these complications are quite common with underlying obesity and T2D. Of the four discontinuations from the study due to AEs, none were related to study product. There were no clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and in standard clinical safety laboratory (chemistry and hematology) parameters over the course of the 12-week duration.
Only basal (fasted) levels of amino acids were measured in this study. The average plasma concentration of the individual amino acid constituents within AXA1125 in all subjects receiving 24g TID AXA1125 in the basal state (i.e., before ingestion of AXA1125) was not meaningfully changed over 12 weeks as compared to their corresponding baseline (Day 1) levels.
The biological effects of AXA1125 were analyzed on the per-protocol group (as defined above), and the findings are summarized below. Actual observation values for each biomarker at each time point are reported versus imputation of the last observation carried forward, or LOCF.
Metabolism
Lipotoxicity and insulin resistance are generally regarded as metabolic drivers of NAFLD. AXA1125 24g TID administration for 12 weeks tended to decrease the mean liver fat content. In the per protocol group, mean liver fat by PDFF was 18.0% (n=22), 14.8% (n=17) and 13.4% (n=13) at baseline, week 6 and week 12, respectively. Similar directional trends were seen with homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, or HOMA IR, with mean HOMA IR of 7.4 (n=22), 3.9 (n=13) and 4.9 (n=14) at baseline, week 6 and week 12, respectively. Effects on liver fat were observed without any accompanying body weight changes despite the provision of approximately 496 additional calories per day via AXA1125 administrations. Subjects did not drastically alter their usual dietary or physical activity patterns during the 12-week study period as assessed by subject food and physical activity diaries. Thus, the observation of body weight neutrality under these circumstances suggests a likely change in nutrient utilization, implicating increased fat oxidation. Assessment of the fasting lipid profile revealed no changes in mean serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and nonesterified fatty acids, with trends toward slight decreases in LDL-C and triglyceride, or TG, levels. However, beta hydroxybutyrate, or BHB, tended to directionally increase as compared to the corresponding mean pre-administration baseline levels, suggestive of a mild-to-moderate ketotic state. A systematic plasma lipidomic profiling demonstrated a tendency to up-regulate acylcarnitines, a marker of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and downregulate toxic lipid species such as ceramides, sphingomyelins and long-chain TGs. Taken together, we believe these results suggest that AXA1125 over 12 weeks tended to impact lipid handling (lowered liver fat and raised BHB).
Inflammation
After 12 weeks of AXA1125 24g TID administration, there were decreased trends in the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In the per protocol group, the mean ALT (expressed as IU/L) was 47.3 (n=22), 36.9 (n=14) and 32.1 (n=13) at baseline, week 6 and week 12, respectively. Similar directional changes were seen in mean monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels (expressed as pg/mL): 305 (n=19), 209 (n=12), and 234 (n=10) at baseline, week 6 and week 12, respectively. The M65 subunit of cytokeratin-18 (expressed as U/L) also declined over the 12-week treatment duration: 884 (n=22), 475 (n=14), and 503 (n=14) at baseline, week 6 and week 12, respectively.
Table of Contents

Fibrosis
Change in a key hepatic fibrogenic marker, Pro-C3 (N-terminal type III collagen propeptide), was assessed after 12 weeks of AXA1125 24g TID administration in the per protocol group. Mean pro-C3 (ng/mL) was 21.6 (n=22), 17.7 (n=14), and 16.9 (n=18) at baseline, week 6, and week 12, respectively. We believe changes in the pro-collagen markers were specific to those that indicate a change in hepatic fibrogenesis (i.e., Pro-C3) versus a more generalized change in collagen metabolism, because total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, or P1NP, considered to be a sensitive marker of bone turnover was not affected by AXA1125. We believe these observations suggest that AXA1125 may selectively impact hepatic fibrogenesis.
Overall, we believe the weight of evidence from these initial results support the directional consistency of changes across both the structural and functional markers associated with liver health. These encouraging results prompted us to design and embark on a randomized placebo-controlled clinical study in a population of NAFLD subjects enriched using noninvasive biomarkers and to further study safety, tolerability and normal structure and function impact.
Ongoing Clinical Study AXA1125-003
AXA1125-003 is an ongoing 16-week (with a two-week follow-up), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, Clinical Study to assess safety, tolerability and impact on the liver structure and function of AXA1125 and AXA1957 in approximately 105 adult subjects with NAFLD. Key inclusion criteria for this study included having at least 10% fat by MRI-PDFF and a corrected T1, or cT1, a measure of liver injury by multiparametric MRI, of at least 830 mSec. Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of T2D. In this study, subjects receive either AXA1125, two different doses of AXA1957 or a calorie-matched placebo control twice a day, or BID (see figure below). Enrollment of 102 subjects in this study was completed in late 2019. 
Study design for AXA1125-003. This Clinical Study was initiated prior to determination of AXA1125 and AXA1957 as therapeutic product candidates.
Completion of enrollment in this study was announced in October 2019. In January 2020, we announced positive interim findings from this ongoing study. This interim analysis included data from approximately half of the study population through the full 16 weeks of administration. The analysis showed that AXA1125 and both doses of AXA1957 have been well tolerated to date. Additionally, both AXA1125 and AXA1957 demonstrated clinically relevant responses and directional changes on the three biological nodes: metabolism (MRI-PDFF and HOMA-IR), inflammation (ALT, CK-18, cT1) and fibrogenesis (proC3). The onset of response in some biomarkers was seen as early as the eight-week post-baseline assessment with continued improvement through 16 weeks. We anticipate reporting top-line data from this study in the second quarter of 2020.

Clinical Study AXA1957-002
AXA1957-002 is a placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomized (2:1) controlled Clinical Study to assess safety and tolerability and the physiological impact of AXA1957 on the normal structures and functions of the liver in approximately 30 adolescent (12-17 year old) subjects with NAFLD. Key inclusion criteria include at least 10% liver fat by MRI-PDFF and a cT1 of > 820 mSec. Subjects are stratified by the presence or absence of T2D. This is among the few clinical programs undertaken to date in a population of adolescent subjects with NAFLD.
As a result of resource reallocations at clinical sites involved in AXA1957-002 from clinical studies and trials toward COVID-19 detection and treatment, enrollment and dosing in this Clinical Study was temporarily suspended in March 2020. We continue to view pediatric NASH as a significant area of unmet need and, utilizing the information gathered thus far from AXA1957-002 and the expected top-line data readout from AXA1125-003, we expect to provide an update on our plans for this program at a future date. 
Study design for AXA1957-002. This Clinical Study was initiated prior to determination of AXA1125 and AXA1957 as therapeutic product candidates.
Our Early-Stage Pipeline
AXA4010 
Overview
We believe that EMMs have the potential to support and maintain blood health, which is critical to a multitude of metabolic functions throughout the body. Using insights from our Clinical Studies with our other product candidates, cell-based studies of novel EMM compositions, published clinical studies of amino acid interventions on blood physiology, published and in-house metabolic profiling data, and published mechanistic understanding of blood health, we identified key metabolic pathways where we believe amino acid biologies drive key aspects of normal blood health.
AXA4010 is a product candidate that contains 10 amino acids and derivatives in distinct ratios. This product candidate was designed to target multiple biological pathways with the goal of supporting normal structures and functions of the blood.
Table of Contents


Underlying Biology | AXA4010 Design Objectives 
Blood production & integrity | Promote proliferation and maturation of blood cells during hematopoietic demandMaintain red blood cell, or RBC, form and function against dehydration, rigidity and support oxygen transport; prevent RBC membrane deformability
Plasma and RBC amino acid imbalance | Restore amino acid balance to support RBC metabolism, including substrates for glutathione and nitric oxide synthesis, improve reactive oxygen species and delivery of amino acids to peripheral tissue 
Vascular health & inflammation | Defend against vascular adhesion, inflammation and vascular stasis 

Ongoing Clinical Study AXA4010-001
AXA4010-001 is an ongoing Clinical Study that is expected to enroll up to 24 subjects ages 12 and older in a staged sequential design of three separate cohorts each for up to 12 weeks (see study design below). 
Study design for AXA4010-001.
In addition to safety and tolerability, the study will assess the effects of AXA4010 on normal blood structure and function, including hemolysis, inflammation and vascular physiology. The first cohort will consist of eight adult subjects with sickle cell disease, or SCD, to test whether AXA4010 can impact normal blood and vascular function. Subsequently, additional adult subjects as well as adolescent subjects may be enrolled into the study. SCD is a chronic hemolytic anemia that is associated with inflammation and metabolic derangements that include nitric oxide depletion and oxidative stress. As a result, we believe SCD is an appropriate biological model in which to study AXA4010’s potential impact on multiple aspects of blood health. We currently anticipate a data readout from Cohort 1 of this study in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Potential Development Paths for AXA4010
If we were to decide to develop AXA4010 under an IND development path, a potential target indication could be SCD. SCD is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and 4.4 million worldwide. For many patients, SCD is defined by chronic organ failure punctuated by acute complications and early mortality. Despite the recent approvals of two new therapeutic agents for SCD, voxelotor and crizanlizumab, significant medical needs still remain to adequately address the sequelae of SCD complications due to its inherently complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. 
If we were to decide to develop AXA4010 as a non-drug product candidate, the target market would be defined by, or with input from, a strategic partner. We believe a non-drug pathway could also represent a significant market opportunity given the potential benefits to overall health by supporting blood health and modulating inflammation. Under a non-drug development path, we or a strategic partner may decide to develop AXA4010 as a dietary supplement to support blood-related structure and function.

AXA2678
Overview
We believe that EMMs have the potential to support and maintain muscle health. Using insights from cell-based studies of novel EMM compositions, published clinical studies of amino acid interventions on muscle physiology, published and in-house metabolic profiling data, and published mechanistic understanding of muscle health, we identified key metabolic pathways where we believe amino acid biologies drive key aspects of normal muscle health.
AXA2678 is a product candidate that contains 10 amino acids and derivatives in distinct ratios. This product candidate was designed to target multiple biological pathways with the goal of maintaining normal muscle structure and function, especially in states of disuse atrophy.

Underlying Biology | AXA2678 Design Objectives 
Proteostasis and anabolic resistance | Optimize the balance between muscle anabolism via increased muscle protein synthesis and catabolism via decreased muscle protein breakdownImprove muscle insulin resistanceStimulate mitochondrial function and provide anaplerotic substrates for the TCA cycle
Inflammation and vasodilation | Decrease inflammation cascades and reactive oxygen species 
Defective myogenesis, the process of forming skeletal muscle fibers, and regeneration | Activate stem cells for muscle growth and differentiation 

Completed Clinical Study AXA2678-001 
AXA2678-001 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Clinical Study in which we examined the safety, tolerability and impact on normal structure and functions of muscle of AXA2678 during single limb immobilization. Twenty healthy young men were randomly assigned (10 per group) to receive AXA2678 or an excipient- and calorie-matched non-amino acid containing placebo for 28 days. 
Muscle biopsies were taken on days 1, 8 (immobilization start), 15 (immobilization end), and 28 (post-immobilization recovery). Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, was utilized to assess quadricep muscle volume, or Mvol, muscle cross-sectional area, or CSA, and muscle fat fraction (FF: the fraction of muscle occupied by fat). Maximal voluntary leg isometric torque was assessed by dynamometry. Administration of AXA2678 attenuated muscle disuse atrophy compared to placebo (p < 0.05) with changes from day 8 to day 15 in placebo: Mvol= −2.4 ± 2.3% and 1CSA = −3.1% ± 2.1%, both p < 0.001 vs. zero; against AXA2678: Mvol: −0.7 ± 1.8% and 1CSA: −0.7 ± 2.1%, both p > 0.3 vs. zero; and p < 0.05 between treatment conditions for CSA. 
During immobilization, muscle FF increased in subjects who received placebo but not AXA2678 (placebo: 12.8 ± 6.1% vs. AXA2678: 0.4 ± 3.1%; p< 0.05). Immobilization resulted in similar reductions in peak leg isometric torque and change in time-to-peak, or TTP, torque in both groups. Recovery (day 15–day 28) of peak torque and TTP torque was also not different between groups, but showed a trend for better recovery in the AXA2678 group. 
AXA2678 at 24g TID (72 g/day) was well-tolerated and no clinically significant safety issues were observed over the 28-day administration period. AEs of sore throat were reported in one subject on two separate occasions (on Day 6, and then again on Day 22) taking AXA2678. Another two AEs of stomach gas and nausea were reported simultaneously in one subject taking AXA2678 on Day 12. These AEs were mild, self-resolving within one day and noted as possibly related to AXA2678 administration. No other AEs were reported with AXA2678 or with placebo. There were no clinically meaningful changes noted in routine safety labs (chemistry, hematology), vital signs or ECG.
Table of Contents

Potential Development Paths for AXA2678 
If we were to decide to develop AXA2678 under an IND development path, we believe it could potentially be investigated for multiple indications characterized by such disuse-related muscle atrophy, including total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, total hip arthroplasty, or THA, hip fracture related myopenia, or HFRM, rotator cuff repairs or injury, and other musculoskeletal atrophy or injuries. In the United States, the market for these conditions each year is upwards of 140,000 patients undergoing TKA, 50,000 undergoing THA, 133,000 recovering from HFRM and 195,000 recovering from rotator cuff injuries annually.
If we were to decide to develop AXA2678 as a non-drug product candidate, the target market likely would be defined by, or with input from, a strategic partner. We believe a non-drug pathway could also represent a significant market opportunity given the potential benefits to muscle health. Under a non-drug development path, we or a strategic partner may decide to develop AXA2678 as a dietary supplement to support muscle-related structure and function. 
Additional Potential Opportunities for EMM Compositions
Many EMMs, including amino acids, are well established agents used to support health. Single EMMs and simple EMM combinations also are already approved as treatments for sickle cell disease, dyslipidemia, inborn errors of metabolism and other conditions. We believe EMM compositions have the potential to address a variety of diseases and conditions, including areas related to intermediary substrate metabolism, muscle atrophy, mitochondrial biology, neuroprotection, inflammation and immunology. We intend to continue to target biologies and disease areas driven by regulation of metabolic pathways in which we can potentially leverage the vital role that EMMs play in regulating metabolic function. To date, we have characterized approximately 75 potential therapeutic applications for EMMs based upon data from public databases, and our own metabolic profiling from biorepository samples. 
Intellectual Property
We are establishing a broad, global intellectual property portfolio for our pipeline and have already received three issued U.S. patents, including both composition of matter and method of use claims. This is notable considering the speed of our development model and establishes a foundation for the large number of submitted applications for our pipeline (127 patents pending worldwide as of December 31, 2019). Our matrixed approach to IP is inclusive of trade secrets and trademarks and encompasses our product candidates (various constituents and amounts); indications; the development platform; manufacturing processes and technologies; and formulations. In our patents for compositions and methods of use, we seek claims of broad and narrow scope. For instance, some claims cover any composition containing a minimum of specified EMMs with activity, while other claims expressly cover specific product candidates by naming all the EMMs present.
We seek to create a multi-dimensional intellectual property portfolio as a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or through collaborations, or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to file patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of leveraging EMMs for treating complex diseases and improving health. We additionally rely on regulatory-related protections such as data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, and where appropriate, plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements. Please see the section on "Risk factors — Risks related to our intellectual property." 
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2019, our product candidate-related patent portfolio consisted of 18 patent families, three granted U.S. patents and 127 worldwide patents pending. To date, all of our patent rights are owned by us. Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications to protect our product candidates and certain aspects of our development platform, manufacturing processes, formulations, and insights into amounts, uses, and features of our EMM compositions.
In addition, we own a portfolio of legacy patents and patent applications related to recombinant proteins for nutrition and therapeutics, including 11 granted and three pending U.S. patents, and five granted and five pending foreign patents.
Examples of the product candidate and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.
Indication-Related Intellectual Property
The indication-related patent rights in our intellectual property portfolio relate to conditions and disorders associated with dysregulated metabolism and provide coverage for product candidates to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states, as well as structure and function of normal organs in the context of dysregulated metabolism. The indication-related patent applications for our lead programs cover novel product candidate compositions and their uses broadly and, with respect to individual product candidates, in detail. Often, we are able to exemplify even our earliest product candidate inventions with human as well as animal and in vitro data. Each of the indication-related patent rights and applications described below are owned by us and are not licensed from any third party.
Notably, while our intellectual property covers drug and non-drug areas, to date, each initial product candidate has been first tested as a food in order to better understand safety, tolerability and the impact on normal human physiology and metabolic pathways. After such initial testing, a decision may be made to deem the product candidate a drug product candidate, and subsequent studies on disease endpoints are conducted under INDs. 
Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Cirrhosis
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for cirrhosis, including our drug product candidate AXA1665. Currently, patent rights relating to cirrhosis include two U.S. patent applications, a PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed to unique features and uses of AXA1665 and related compositions currently includes one provisional application. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for NAFLD/NASH
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for fatty liver disease, including our drug product candidates AXA1125 and AXA1957. Currently, patent rights relating to AXA1125 and related compositions and their uses in fatty liver disease include three granted U.S. patents, two U.S. patent applications, and over 40 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2037, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed more specifically to AXA1957 and related compositions and uses currently includes one U.S. patent application, one PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.

Compositions and Methods for Blood and Sickle Cell Disease
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for blood health and sickle cell disease, including our product candidate AXA4010 and related compositions and uses. Currently, this family of applications includes one U.S. patent application, one PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed to specific, related compositions and uses currently includes one U.S. provisional patent application. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for Acute Muscle Atrophy
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for muscle atrophy, including our product candidate AXA2678. Currently, patent rights relating to muscle atrophy include one U.S. patent application and over 40 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2037, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed to unique features and uses of AXA2678 and related compositions currently includes one U.S. patent application, one PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury and Stroke
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for traumatic brain injury and stroke. Currently, patent rights relating to traumatic brain injury include two U.S. patent applications, one PCT patent application, and six foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this portfolio to expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Additional AXA Combination-Related Patents
We have filed provisional patent applications directed to combinations of particular product candidates (e.g., AXA1957) and EMM combinations with particular NAFLD/NASH drugs and drug candidates, and some novel EMM compositions. We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire in 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Platform-Related Intellectual Property
In addition to the indication-related intellectual property, our intellectual property portfolio also includes know-how and patent applications directed to our development platform and other technologies developed internally. Exemplary platform technologies that are the subject of such patent applications include:
•manufacturing processes for complex EMM compositions (currently one U.S. patent application, one PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications);
•taste formulations (currently one U.S. patent application, one PCT patent application, and two foreign national patent applications); and
•unique formulations of candidate compositions (2 separate provisional applications).
Our development platform iterates and integrates data from literature, including patents, in vitro experiments, animal studies and our own Clinical Studies, giving us significant competitive advantages. Our development platform, which is protected by trade secrets, is core to maintaining our first mover advantage. These advantages translate into a unique understanding of metabolism, development of many new product candidates, and creation of intellectual property around our product candidates and development platform technologies.
Table of Contents

These development platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our product candidates. Our patent applications directed to platform-related technologies, if issued, would expire beginning in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
Therapeutic Modality Intellectual Property
Our proprietary knowledge and insights into the behavior of EMMs have yielded inventions related to categories of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis. Our patent applications directed to these underlying modalities, if issued, would expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. We will also prosecute patent applications owned by or co-owned with third party licensors. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we plan to file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, and South Korea.
Individual patent terms depend upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States and most other countries have patent terms that expire 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of a regulatory review period, although patent term restoration in the United States applies to a new chemical entity, so may not apply to some EMM compositions. In Europe, any patentee can obtain a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, on the basis of approval of a therapeutic product covered by the patent based on a full clinical development program. Any restoration period is limited to a maximum restoration time (five years in the United States and Europe) and total effective patent life of the approved drug product (14 years in the United States and 15 years in Europe). The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and local decisions about the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Regulatory Exclusivity
Under certain circumstances, approval of a drug product by a health authority will result in a period of data exclusivity and/or market exclusivity (together considered as regulatory exclusivity) for the product. Data exclusivity means that no party can file for approval of a drug product based on the original drug approval application data. Market exclusivity (such as orphan drug exclusivity) means that the health authority may not be permitted to give final approval to a drug product for a defined period of time, absent certain conditions. In the United States, five-year data exclusivity is only available upon initial approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which may not apply to some EMM product compositions. Moreover, if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) application is filed with a “Paragraph IV certification” referencing a product protected by NCE exclusivity and Orange Book-listed patent(s), FDA may accept such application for filing four years after the reference product’s approval rather than five years. A new drug application with a Paragraph IV certification provides an opportunity for initiating patent litigation, and FDA cannot grant final approval of the application until the earlier of resolution of the patent litigation in the applicant’s favor or 30 months from the Paragraph IV notice date. See “Hatch-Waxman Act and Generic Competition” for further information. Three-year market exclusivity may also be granted upon approval of applications (including supplements) containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies), conducted by the applicant and essential to the FDA’s approval of new versions or conditions of use of previously approved drugs, such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or other conditions of use. However, the scope of such exclusivity is generally limited to the particular basis of the approval (e.g., the new indication or dosage form). In Europe, the period of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product approved based on a full stand-alone dossier consisting of quality, pre-clinical and clinical trial data is 10 years, which consists of eight years of data exclusivity against data cross-referencing of a generic application and two years of market exclusivity where the generic product (even if approved in the first eight years of the protection period) cannot be marketed until the full 10-year exclusivity or protection period has expired. This 10-year of exclusivity or protection period can be cumulatively extended to 11 years even during the first eight years of the protection/exclusivity period, the marketing authorization holder has obtained approval of one or more new therapeutic indications that are held to bring about a significant benefit as compared with existing therapies. We believe that our products, if approved, should be entitled to the full 10 years of regulatory data exclusivity in Europe. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. is seven years. See “Orphan Drug Designation” for further information. Conducting a pediatric study in response to, and in compliance with the conditions of, a written request from FDA extends every form of existing regulatory exclusivity as well as patents by 6 months in the U.S. provided that the data is submitted in a timely manner. For orphan indications, the product is eligible for a period of 10 years of orphan market exclusivity in the EU, during which the EU regulatory authorities are not permitted to accept or approve a similar medicinal product in relation to the approved orphan indication. This period can be extended to a maximum of 12 years if the marketing authorization holder has conducted and provided data in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan and has not secured an SPC on the basis of the product approval. Orphan drug exclusivity in Japan is 10 years. 
Trademark Protection
As of December 31, 2019, our trademark portfolio contains more than 50 registrations and pending applications. We have trademarks in over 12 countries, including the European Union. For the marks AXCELLA and the Axcella LOGO, we have pending applications in Canada and Brazil as well as International Registrations designating China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia. In the United States we have a registration for the Axcella LOGO, and pending applications for the AXCELLA and AXCELLA HEALTH marks.
Table of Contents

Trade Secrets
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our development platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secret technology, e.g., AxcellaKB, confidential product candidates, and commercial plans in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. To learn more about risks related to trade secrets for our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on "Risk factors — Risks related to our intellectual property."
Manufacturing
To date, we have rapidly designed and efficiently manufactured product candidates and believe our process is readily scalable. Under our existing agreements with our manufacturers, we have been able to secure initial product candidates to initiate our Clinical Studies in less than three months from identifying the product amount needed. We continue to make enhancements to our product candidates to make them even more consumer-friendly, including in their formulation (e.g., taste and texture), packaging (e.g., easy to open sachets) and administration (e.g., water soluble). Our product candidates are supplied in a dry powder form, which is dissolved in water and then administered orally as an orange-flavored drink. Our formulation enables us to deliver high concentrations of dry powder materials at appropriate administration volumes. This covers a wide range of raw material characteristics, and we believe will enable us to deliver multiple oral dosage forms to meet Clinical Study and Clinical Trial needs, as well as commercial needs.
Any product candidates that we decide to develop as drug candidates under INDs will be manufactured at a well-known contract manufacturing organization (CMO) under pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to produce the dry powder forms in sealed foil sachets. Chemical and microbiological testing of product candidates will be performed by this same CMO per defined product specifications and Certificate of Analysis will be issued for each batch. Chemical and microbiological testing will be performed using validated test methods. We believe these processing steps would enable us to readily provide high quality Clinical Trial Material, or CTM, product to support multiple Clinical Trials conducted under INDs and that are readily scalable to support commercial drug product requirements, if any of our product candidates regulated as drugs receive regulatory approval.
Government regulation
Our ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs for initial and subsequent therapeutic indications or commercialization of non-drug products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing as a drug in the United States, and we have not marketed any product as a food (including dietary supplements) or medical food. In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products as well as non-drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import and export, of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Table of Contents

For our product candidates developed as drugs, the process required by the FDA before such products can be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human Clinical Trials may begin;
•approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each Clinical Trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human Clinical Trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other Clinical Trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA, to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the Clinical Trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA and/or us as Clinical Trial sponsor;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Regulation of Drug Product Candidates and Drugs
Preclinical and Clinical Trials for drugs
Once a product candidate is identified for development as a drug, it generally enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate the potential for adverse events, which must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as the results of our Clinical Studies, would be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans for a therapeutic indication and must become effective before human Clinical Trials for such purpose may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the Clinical Trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the Clinical Trial can begin. Submission of an IND does not ensure that FDA will allow Clinical Trials to commence at all or on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive Clinical Trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, and IRB approval must be obtained before each Clinical Trial can begin.
Table of Contents

Such Clinical Trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human volunteers under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical Trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the Clinical Trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol for our product candidates which we decide to market through the drug development pathway must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a Clinical Trial must also review and approve the Clinical Trial, including its protocol and informed consent form, before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the Clinical Trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a Clinical Trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing of drug product candidates also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
Human Clinical Trials to support NDAs, for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In certain circumstances, where sufficient evidence of safety and tolerability are collected from preclinical studies and other human experience with a product, subject to discussions and acceptance by the FDA, such as our non-IND human clinical studies, we believe that for the development of such drug candidate, a human Clinical Trial may begin at Phase II, or combined Phase I/II, rather than starting at Phase I. We would expect to discuss with the FDA such proposal to initiate the clinical development program of a drug candidate in a later phase study without first conducting a Phase I Clinical Trial or Trials.
•Phase I — Phase I Clinical Trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase II — Phase II Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
•Phase III — Phase III Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed Clinical Trial sites. These Clinical Trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV Clinical Trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV Clinical Trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the Clinical Trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with Clinical Trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including research tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product's showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Clinically superior means that a drug is shown to provide a significant therapeutic advantage over and above that provided by an approved drug that is otherwise the same drug in one or more of the following ways: greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target populations, and in unusual cases, where neither greater safety nor greater effectiveness has been shown, a demonstration that the drug otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited development and review programs for drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Table of Contents

Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. In addition, if a sponsor submits an NDA for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval, such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent NDA. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products for treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product's clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the FDA for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
U.S. marketing approval for drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing of our product candidates for drug uses, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug's safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and Clinical Trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored Clinical Trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product's use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date for a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. 
Table of Contents

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it historically has tended to follow such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more Clinical Trial sites and/or the Clinical Trial sponsor to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and Clinical Trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Table of Contents

Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV Clinical Trials, be conducted to further assess a drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or information on reduced effectiveness, requirements for post-market studies or Clinical Trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval Clinical Trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
Hatch-Waxman Act and Generic Competition
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products under section 505(j) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) provides for approval of an ANDA that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved drug (commonly known as the reference drug). In considering whether to approve such a generic drug product, the FDA requires that an ANDA applicant demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug product’s active ingredient is the same as that of the reference product, that the proposed generic is bioequivalent to the reference product, that any impurities in the proposed product do not affect the product’s safety or effectiveness, and that its manufacturing processes and methods ensure the consistent potency and purity of its proposed product. 
Table of Contents

In addition to the ANDA pathway, the Hatch-Waxman Act also established an abbreviated approval pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA for applications that contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2) permits approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on FDA’s finding of safety or effectiveness for an approved drug product.
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to submit certain information about patents related to their drugs for listing in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book). ANDA and section 505(b)(2) applicants generally must submit a certification or statement regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid and/or will not be infringed by the marketing of the ANDA or section 505(b)(2) applicant’s product is called a “Paragraph IV certification.” If an ANDA or section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted to the FDA and accepted as a reviewable filing, the ANDA or section 505(b)(2) applicant then must provide, within 20 days of FDA acceptance, notice to the NDA holder and patent owner stating that the application has been submitted and providing the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid and/or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent owner then may file suit against the ANDA or section 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30-month stay of the FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or section 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The 30-month stay begins on the date of receipt of the Paragraph IV notice and, in the case where an ANDA or section 505(b)(2) application is submitted before a reference product’s NCE exclusivity expires (i.e., four years after approval of the reference product), the 30-month period is extended to ensure that approval of the ANDA or section 505(b)(2) application cannot be granted for 7-1/2 years after initial approval of the reference product. Nevertheless, the FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay (or 7-1/2 year period) if a court finds the patent invalid and/or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
On December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (FCAA 2020) became law. Section 610, entitled “Actions for Delays of Generic Drugs and Biological Products”, provides generic drug (ANDA and 505(b)(2)) and biosimilar developers with a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of reference product from the brand manufacturer, or a generic or biosimilar manufacturer, necessary for approval of the developers’ generic or biosimilar product. If a generic drug or biosimilar developer is successful in its suit, the defendant manufacturer would be required to provide sufficient quantities of product on commercially-reasonable, market-based terms and may be required to pay the developer’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as well as financial compensation under certain circumstances. The purpose of section 610 is to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar products. We cannot determine what effect section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on manufacturers that may develop generic or other competing versions of our products if approved as drugs.
Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Table of Contents

Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. 
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Other healthcare and privacy laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, provide or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, arrangement or prescription of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term ‘‘remuneration’’ has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute.
Table of Contents

•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws including the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; or knowingly making a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or knowingly concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, with respect to drug products, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product, or promoting a product off-label. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Any future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for drug products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rules published January 2013, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, for information related to certain payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
Table of Contents

•Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies implement compliance to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. Data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may also be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018).
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company's attention from its business.
Moreover, on October 17, 2019, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a Proposed Rule: Revisions to Safe Harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil Monetary Penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements to, among other things, add new safe harbors for certain value-based arrangements. Although the value-based proposals would not include pharmaceutical manufacturers among the entities that could permissibly enter into such contracting arrangements, the general trend toward outcomes and value-based contracts in the healthcare industry may continue. It is possible that payors, among other customers, could push manufacturers for novel contracting approaches, including those that would incorporate value-based principles, and these efforts could affect our business. It is unclear at this time whether this proposed rule will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, it would have on the cost and ability to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or on our business.
Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, that we may develop as drugs, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
Table of Contents

The ACA, for example, expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program, and imposed annual, non-deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain types of branded prescription drugs and biologics. With the current administration and Congress, there will likely be additional administrative or legislative changes, including modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which may impact reimbursement for drugs. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion holding that, while the individual mandate was no longer constitutional, the case must be remanded to the District Court to further evaluate whether the mandate can be severed from the ACA or the entire ACA must be stricken down. On January 3, 2020, petitions for certiorari were filed with motions to expedite requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court review the Fifth Circuit’s decision and ultimately decide the constitutionality of the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to grant the petitions. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole." Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2029, unless additional Congressional action is taken.
•The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers.

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. For example, the United States government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Further, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration released a "Blueprint," or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The current administration’s Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. For example, on December 23, 2019, the Trump administration, through the FDA, released a proposed rule and draft guidance that set forth two pathways for the legal importation of certain drugs in an effort to control drug costs. Since these pathways are not yet effective and are subject to revision pending receipt of public comments, we cannot determine what effect these pathways may have on our business and financials. Individual states in the United States have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected by the passage of these laws or similar federal or state legislation and regulations.
Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; Changing legal requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which the company or its products may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety, quality and efficacy and governing, among other things, Clinical Trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the European Economic Area, or the EEA (comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
•Centralized procedure — If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the adoption of a positive opinion of the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization in the form of a binding decision valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is considered as of a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the timeframe for completing the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops that ordinarily occur at Day 120 of the procedure.
Table of Contents

•National authorization procedures — There are also two other possible routes to authorize products in more than one country in the EEA for therapeutic indications, which fall outside the scope of the mandatory centralized procedure: 
◦Decentralized procedure — Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
◦Mutual recognition procedure — In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
Following the ratification of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, or Withdrawal Agreement, by the European Parliament and UK Parliament, the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. The Withdrawal Agreement provides for a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which the UK remains in the single market and customs union and the free movement of people will continue, in order to ensure frictionless trade and business continuity until a long-term relationship is agreed between the UK and the EU. During the transition period, EU law and rules continue to apply in the UK. The Withdrawal Agreement envisages that following its departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, the UK can no longer participate in EU institutions and their decision-making. This will mean the UK can no longer be represented on various advisory committees within the EMA during the Centralized procedure. The UK cannot participate in the meetings of Coordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralized procedure and cannot act as a Reference Member State. However, the UK can participate in the Decentralized procedure and Mutual Recognition procedure as a Concerned Member State during the transition period. 
At the end of transition, the UK’s relationship with the EU will be determined by the new agreements it has entered into on trade and other areas of cooperation. The new agreements must be reached before the transition period ends. If not, the UK would have to rely on previous international conventions for security cooperation and would trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms. The exception is Northern Ireland, whose trade in goods with the EU would be covered by the provisions in the Northern Ireland Protocol.
In the EEA, a reference medicinal product is defined as the product which was authorized based on a full stand-alone dossier consisting of quality, preclinical testing and clinical trial data. A reference medicinal product includes those that contain a new active substance which has not been approved in the EU previously. As indicated above, upon grant of a marketing authorization, a reference medicinal product will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and Clinical Trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during this exclusivity. The market exclusivity or protection means that even if the generic or biosimilar product is authorized, such a product cannot be marketed in the EU Member States until the full 10-year exclusivity period has expired. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

The criteria for designating an "orphan medicinal product" in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough its own approved orphan medicinal product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of Clinical Trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the Clinical Trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a Clinical Trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation, through an independent audit. The regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all Clinical Trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing Clinical Trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual Clinical Trial. If a Clinical Trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the Clinical Trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of Clinical Trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the "EU portal"; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for Clinical Trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for Clinical Trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a Clinical Trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). The technical assessment in Part I is led by the “reporting member state” that will form the basis for consideration by the member states concerned by the application during the coordinated review phase of the process. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict timelines have been established for the assessment of Clinical Trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.

The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the European Economic Area. This expansion would incorporate any Clinical Trial activities in European Economic Area. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for "sensitive information" which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the European Economic Area. The GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object, and requires them to consent, to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies and obtain compensation for damages in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. It requires controllers and processors of personal data to provide information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implement safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, provide notice of data breaches, and take certain measures when engaging with third-party processors. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer "adequate" privacy protections. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of annual global revenues, or € 20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules, including as implemented by individual countries. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated now that the United Kingdom has left the EU.
There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Additionally, should we elect one or more product candidates to develop and market as non-drug products in foreign countries, such products would also be subject to regulation under various national, local, and international laws that include provision governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and advertising. These regulations may prevent or delay entry into the market or prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our non-drug product candidates.
The regulatory environment outside the United States varies and in general is less developed then in the United States, but some exceptions do exist. The regulatory requirements for nutritional non-drug products and food products outside of the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding nutritional non-drug products and food products. The two leading jurisdictions, the United States and the Europe, currently have and may continue to have distinctly different regulatory regimes with different rules and requirements for nutritional non-drug products and food products, with, for example, the European Union having a stronger process for claims review and preapproval for nutritional products. Regulation in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other European countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to dietary products.
We cannot predict how the global regulatory landscape regarding our possible nutritional non-drug products or food products, if any, will evolve and we may incur increased regulatory costs as regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate evolve or change. We cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to any of our product candidates.

Should we utilize third part distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
Regulation of Food Products
FDA regulation of dietary supplements
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 defines dietary supplement products to be "foods" under the FD&C Act, and they are regulated as such by the FDA. The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, similarly with conventional foods, regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of dietary supplements. Among other things, manufacturers of dietary supplements must meet applicable cGMPs, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of dietary supplements.
Under federal law, dietary supplements are defined in relevant part as a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients, which include any of the following: a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract, or any combination of those substances. Dietary supplements may not include articles that are approved as new drugs or biologics or that have been authorized for investigation as new drugs or biologics for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food prior to such approval or authorization.
The manufacturer of a dietary supplement is responsible for ensuring the safety of its product and must demonstrate either that each dietary ingredient was marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States before October 15, 1994, or if the dietary ingredient was not marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States before October 15, 1994, referred to as a "new dietary ingredient," or NDI, then the dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. For any supplement containing a new dietary ingredient for which the dietary ingredients have not been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or the supplement must submit pre-market notification to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement. Even to the extent the NDI was present in the food supply prior to October 15, 1994 or is used in conventional foods, if there are any changes to the ingredient's manufacturing or form as it was present in the food supply at that time or from how it exists in its conventional food form, then the ingredient may also be considered a NDI requiring notification.
Notification of use of a "New Dietary Ingredient" must inform the FDA of the basis on which the manufacturer has concluded that the supplement containing an NDI is reasonably expected to be safe under the recommended conditions of use. The FDA may not respond to such notification, but no response does not mean the FDA has determined that the ingredient is safe or permissible for use in a dietary supplement.
If the FDA determines that a product candidate which has already been brought to market and marketed as a dietary supplement contains a NDI without prior notification or contains some other substance not permitted in supplements, it may determine that the product is adulterated and/or misbranded in violation of federal law. In such a case, the FDA may take enforcement or other legal actions, including, but not limited to, warning or untitled enforcement letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any such enforcement actions or other consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company and its current and future ability to development the product candidates through the selected pathway or other pathways.
In addition, manufacturers of dietary supplements must ensure that ingredients in their products that are not defined as dietary ingredients comply with all the requirements applicable to foods. For example, fillers and other constituents of the product must be approved as food additives or must be deemed GRAS for the conditions of use in order to be sold.

FDA regulation of conventional food
Conventional food products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of conventional foods. Among other things, manufacturers of conventional foods must meet applicable current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
The FD&C Act requires that all food products be safe, meaning a reasonably scientific certainty that the substance is not harmful for its intended use. The FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of a food to which has been added an approved drug or biologic, or a drug or biologic for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public, unless such a drug was marketed as a food before approval or meets other certain exceptions.
Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the FD&C Act, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food or added to food is considered to be a "food additive", with a few exceptions, and is therefore subject to FDA premarket review and approval, unless the substance is generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures or, in the case of a substance used prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, a standard referred to as "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS. A food additive must either already be included within one of the number of FDA regulations authorizing the use of certain food additives under certain conditions of use or be approved for use by the FDA. To obtain approval for use of a food additive, a manufacturer must submit a petition to the FDA with sufficient data to demonstrate reasonable certainty of no harm at the intended levels of use. Any food that contains an unapproved food additive is considered adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act.
Ingredients that are determined to be GRAS (as described below) do not fall within the definition of a food additive, which, as noted above, requires mandatory premarket approval. Under sections 201(s) of the FD&C Act, and FDA's implementing regulations in 21 CFR § 170.3 and 21 CFR § 170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food.
General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and must be based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data, information, or methods, which are ordinarily published, as well as the application of scientific principles, and may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial history of consumption of a substance for food use by a significant number of consumers. If an ingredient is GRAS for one use or in one form, it is not necessarily GRAS for all uses or forms. Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, it is the intended use of a substance, rather than the substance itself, that is eligible for classification as GRAS.
Manufacturers of GRAS substances may notify the FDA of their view that a substance is GRAS and thus not subject to the premarket approval requirements of section 409 of the FD&C Act. The notification must include, among other things, a description of the substance, the applicable conditions of use, the dietary exposure, an explanation of the basis for the determination that the substance was determined to be safe for the intended use and supporting data and information. Upon review of such a notification, the FDA may respond with a "no questions" letter stating that while it has not made its own GRAS determination, it has no questions at the time regarding the applications' own GRAS determination. Alternatively, manufacturers may elect to "self-affirm" a given substance is GRAS without the voluntary FDA notification but should retain all applicable safety data used for the GRAS determination in the case of inquiry by the FDA. However, in neither case does this constitute an approval equivalent to that achieved through the food additive process. A manufacturer's use of such food additive is at its own risk and is dependent upon adequate substantiation and/or scientific support demonstrating safe use.

With certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which an investigational drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND, as required by FDA regulations. The FDA published a guidance document in September 2013 for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs, "Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted without an IND" that provides the FDA's thinking on when an IND is required for human research studies. Based on this guidance, we understand and believe that the FDA's interpretation of its regulations is that they do not require human testing of food ingredients or dietary supplements to be conducted under an IND unless such testing is intended to evaluate the product's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. In this guidance, the FDA specifically recognizes an IND will not be required when a study is designed to "evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease in a diseased population," provided the study is not designed to assess the impact of the food or medical food on the disease. There is no assurance that our understanding of the FDA's guidance is accurate or that the FDA's thinking on this matter will not change. If it does, the FDA may decide to take enforcement action to prohibit the Non-IND testing of substances that it believes should be conducted under an IND. For any products that we ultimately develop as drugs, the FDA may delay or deny an IND submitted with supporting data from human studies with such products not conducted under an IND or require alternate or additional data to support the IND before authorizing an applicant to proceed.
Additionally, depending on the circumstances, the use of a substance in certain clinical investigations under an IND may restrict the marketing of such substance in food. Section 301(II) of the FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of any food containing a drug substance that has been approved by FDA or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, unless the substance was marketed in food before any substantial clinical investigations involving the drug were instituted or one of the other exceptions in section 301(II) applies. Accordingly, we understand and believe that the prior marketing of a substance of interest in food before an IND has been allowed or beginning any clinical investigations preserves the option to continue to market the substance in those forms after substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and their existence has been made public.
The FDA may classify some or all of our potential product candidates as containing a food additive that is not GRAS, or otherwise impermissible substances. Such classification would cause these product candidates to require pre-market approval for a food additive, or else it would need to be subject to an existing food additive regulation authorizing its use, which could substantially delay or prevent the commercialization of these product candidates for non-drug uses. Any delay in the regulatory consultation process or a determination that any of our drug or food product candidates do not meet regulatory requirements of the FDA, including any applicable GRAS requirements, could cause a delay in or prevent the commercialization of our product candidates, which may lead to reduced acceptance by the public or others or an inability to commercialize those candidates at all. Moreover, if the FDA determines that a product candidate marketed as a conventional food contains a non-GRAS additive after the product has already been commercialized, then the FDA may take enforcement or other legal consequences, including, but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Permissible claims for conventional foods and dietary supplements
The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the FTC, heavily regulate any express or implied claims made about food and dietary supplement products, and/or their ingredients, including, but not limited to, any claims made in product labeling, marketing, promotion, on social media, or on the firm's website. FTC seeks to ensure the truth, accuracy, and substantiation of dietary supplement claims, and the FDA regulates the type and specific content of such claims.
Table of Contents

With respect to dietary supplements and conventional foods, products are only allowed to make certain truthful and non-misleading claims without prior FDA-approval, and may not make unapproved health or qualified health claims, or any other claims that expressly or implicitly characterize the relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition (e.g., drug claims). Specifically, 21 C.F.R. § 101.93(g) prohibits claims, whether express or implied, that a dietary supplement is intended to "diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease" and the use of such claims could subject a dietary supplement product to regulation as a drug. The FDA defines "disease" at 21 C.F.R. § 101.93(g)(1) to include any "damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly . . ., or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning," though excludes diseases resulting from deficiencies in essential nutrients. For these types of claims, there must be significant scientific support and approval by the FDA prior to marketing the product. Similarly, as in the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is "intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease" under 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B), except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug. In other words, products marketed as dietary supplements and conventional foods cannot make health claims or drug claims (i.e., that the product is intended to diagnose, prevent, or cure any disease or condition) without prior FDA-approval of such claims. Dietary supplement products are permitted to make
structure/function claims subject to post-market notification to the FDA and inclusion of an FDA required disclaimer. "Structure/function" claims refer to a product's ability to maintain healthy bodily structure or function or claims describing the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient or characterizing the way in which a nutrient or dietary ingredient supports or maintains such structure or function.
In determining whether or not a particular claim is permissible, the FDA considers the overall context in which that claim is made. As such, the direct recommendation of particular products to users based on deficiencies or other characteristics in their nutritional or health profiles may be viewed by the FDA as an implied disease claim and thus impermissible (except for specific allowed health claims or qualified health claims for supplements or foods or allowed nutrient content claims in foods or structure/function claims for dietary supplements).
The use of product claims on product candidates developed as non-drug products always carries a risk of regulatory enforcement action or other legal consequences, which may include class action litigation. Claims and other marketing or promotional activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Any such actions could materially affect us in an adverse way.
FDA regulation of medical food uses
Medical foods are a category of foods distinct from conventional food and dietary supplements. The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the FTC, also regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of medical foods. Among other things, manufacturers of medical foods must meet relevant cGMPs, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
As defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3)), a medical food is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation." The FDA has established a regulation at 21 C.F.R. 101.9(j)(8) that further defines a medical food as a product that is (1) is specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube; (2) is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone; (3) provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation; (4) is intended to be used under medical supervision; and (5) is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.

Because the marketing of medical foods generally does not require FDA pre-market approval, the medical food category may offer promising opportunities for our products should we pursue that development path. However, we understand that the FDA considers the statutory definition of medical foods to narrowly constrain the types of products that fit within this category of food. There can be no assurance we will be able to develop the data that are needed to substantiate the positioning of the product as a medical food or that the FDA would concur the product meets the definition of medical food. In such cases, the commercialization of such product candidates may be delayed or prevented. To the extent that any product candidate is marketed as a medical food and subsequently determined to not fall within the proper regulatory category or are considered to be misbranded or adulterated, the company may be subject to enforcement action or other legal consequences, including, but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any such actions or other consequences could have a material adverse effect on the firm and its current and future ability to development the product candidates through the selected pathway or other pathways.
Moreover, the ingredients and additives used in medical foods are subject to the same regulations as conventional foods and must be GRAS or otherwise covered by an existing food additive regulation, approved food additive petition, or authorized by a prior sanction. The FDA may determine that some or all of our potential product candidates contain ingredients that are not GRAS and are therefore food additives. Such classification would cause these product candidates to require pre-market approval for a food additive, which could substantially delay or prevent the commercialization of these product candidates for medical food uses. If the FDA determines that a product candidate marketed as a medical food contains a substance that is not GRAS and is therefore a food additive after the product has already been commercialized, and such food additive is not approved or authorized by the FDA pursuant to a food additive regulation, then the firm may face enforcement or other legal consequences including, but not limited to, those mentioned above.
Government regulation of food for special medical purpose in the European Union
The regulatory requirements for foods for special medical purposes, or FSMPs, in the European Union cover FSMP development and commercialization.
In the European Union, FSMPs are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. European Union regulation defines food for special medical purposes' as food specially processed or formulated and intended for the dietary management of patients, including infants, to be used under medical supervision; it is intended for the exclusive or partial feeding of patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete ordinary food or certain nutrients contained therein, or metabolites, or with other medically-determined nutrient requirements, whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone.
Businesses intending to commercialize FSMPs in the European Union are required to register their FSMPs by submitting notifications regarding FSMP use, demonstrating compliance with applicable European Union rules, prior to market commercialization. These notifications to competent authority of each European Union Member State include information appearing on the label, and any other information the competent authority may reasonably request to establish compliance with this Regulation.
The European Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts (a) whether a given food falls within the scope of this Regulation; and (b) to which specific category of food a given food belongs. European Food Safety Authority Guidance provides, among other requirements, that the dossier must include an explanation of the scientific and medical basis on which it has been concluded that the use of the specific food product is necessary or is more practical or safer than the exclusive use of non-FSMP foodstuffs.

FSMPs can also fall within the scope of the novel food legislation in the European Union. Where an ingredient used in the FSMP to be marketed in the European Union falls within the definition of a 'novel food ingredient' prior authorization for use of the ingredient needs to be sought. A "novel" food or food ingredients as food that has not been consumed to a significant degree by humans in the European Union before May 15, 1997 and that falls within one of the ten food categories listed. Novel foods and novel food ingredients can only be authorized if they do not pose a safety risk to human health, their intended use does not mislead the consumer and they do not differ from the food they are intended to replace in such a way that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer. The authorization procedure is likely to take between 12 and 18 months.
In accordance with European Union Clinical Trials directives, before a Clinical Trial site is allowed to start enrolling patients in a Clinical Trial, the IRB/independent ethics committee, or IEC, must provide a positive opinion concerning the study protocol and all study-related materials. The competent authorities of the relevant European Union Member State must also provide their related authorization. Clinical Trials involving the investigation of the action of non-medicinal products (e.g., foods, such as many FSMPs), are not covered and are not required to register the Clinical Trial or to complete a Clinical Trial application (CTA) for approval by a European Union Member State.
Competition
The healthcare industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical, nutritional foods companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. 
There are additional companies that are working on modulating specific metabolic pathways involved in various health and disease conditions, although we are not aware of any company creating Axcella product candidate-like products with multifactorial activity for the same indications and targets as Axcella. Entrinsic Biosciences, Inc. is developing amino acid compositions to treat gastrointestinal disorders and other conditions associated with dysfunctional transport membrane proteins. Entrinsic Biosciences has disclosed plans to file an IND for NET Carcinoid Syndrome Diarrhea in 2020 and has a pipeline of product candidates in preclinical and discovery programs. Companies with clinical programs that could compete with our current pipeline of product candidates include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., Genfit SA, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Kaleido Biosciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis AG, Scholar Rock Holding Corporation, and Viking Therapeutics, Inc., among others. 
We also anticipate competing with the largest consumer health companies and nutritional and amino acid companies in the world, such as Abbott Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Nestlé Health Science S.A., and The Procter & Gamble Company, all of which are currently conducting research in competitive indications or may be interested in using amino acids and other EMMs as therapeutics as well as nutritional supplements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 64 full-time employees. Of those employees, 32 have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 26 were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
We lease a facility containing 19,200 square feet of laboratory and office space, which is located at 840 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lease expires in April 2021, subject to two options to extend the lease for a total of six years. We believe that our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current and near-term needs.
Legal proceedings
We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
