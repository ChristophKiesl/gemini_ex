Item 1. Business 
Polaris Inc., formerly known as Polaris Industries Inc., a Minnesota corporation, was formed in 1994 and is the successor to Polaris Industries Partners LP. The terms “Polaris,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to the business and operations of Polaris Inc., its subsidiaries and its predecessors, which began doing business in 1954. We design, engineer and manufacture powersports vehicles which include, Off-Road Vehicles (ORV), including All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) and side-by-side vehicles for recreational and utility use, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, Global Adjacent Markets vehicles, including Commercial, Government and Defense vehicles, and Boats. Polaris also designs and manufactures or sources parts, garments and accessories (PG&A) related to its vehicles and aftermarket products and services for off-road and on-road vehicles. Polaris products are sold online and through dealers, distributors, and retail stores principally located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Mexico. 
Business Segments 
We operate in six business segments; ORV, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, Global Adjacent Markets, Aftermarket, and Boats. Our products are sold through a network of approximately 2,300 independent dealers in North America, approximately 1,400 independent international dealers through over 30 subsidiaries, and approximately 90 independent distributors in over 120 countries outside of North America. A majority of our dealers and distributors are multi-line and also carry competitor products, however few carry our full line of products and, while relatively consistent, the actual number of dealers can vary from time to time. We also sell through a network of brick-and-mortar retail centers.
Off-Road Vehicles: 
ORVs are four-wheel vehicles designed for off-road use and traversing a wide variety of terrain, including dunes, trails, and mud. The vehicles can be multi-passenger or single passenger, are used for recreation in such sports as fishing and hunting and for trail and dune riding, and for utility purposes on farms, ranches, and construction sites. The ORV industry is comprised of ATVs and side-by-side vehicles. Internationally, ATVs and side-by-sides are sold primarily in Western European countries by similar manufacturers as in North America. 
Estimated North America and worldwide ORV industry retail sales are summarized as follows:

 | Twelve months ended December 31,
Estimated* Approximate Industry Sales (in units) | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 
North America ATV retail sales | 345,000 | 260,000 | 260,000
North America side-by-side retail sales | 640,000 | 510,000 | 475,000
North America ORV retail sales | 985,000 | 770,000 | 735,000
Worldwide ATV retail sales | 465,000 | 380,000 | 370,000
Worldwide side-by-side retail sales | 690,000 | 550,000 | 530,000
Worldwide ORV retail sales | 1,155,000 | 930,000 | 900,000
*Estimates are unaudited and based on internally-generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third party surveys of the industries in which we compete. See Market and Industry Data section for additional information.

The side-by-side market has increased consistently over the past several years primarily due to continued innovation by manufacturers. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted both ATV and side-by-side sales as these products provide an attractive social-distancing solution for new and existing Powersports customers.
In 2020, we continued to be the North America market share leader in Off-Road Vehicles. Our ORV lineup includes the RZR sport side-by-side, the RANGER utility side-by-side, the GENERAL crossover side-by-side, and the Sportsman ATV. The full line (excluding military vehicles) spans 85 models, including two-, four- and six-wheel drive general purpose, recreational, and commercial vehicles. In many of our segments, we offer youth, value, mid-size, premium and extreme-performance vehicles, which come in both single passenger and multi-passenger seating arrangements. Key 2020 ORV product introductions included the fully redesigned SPORTSMAN 450 & SPORTSMAN 570, SPORTSMAN 570 ULTIMATE TRAIL LE, RANGER XP1000 NORTHSTAR ULTIMATE, RANGER XP1000 TRAIL BOSS, GENERAL XP1000 PURSUIT EDITION, GENERAL XP1000 FACTORY CUSTOM EDITION, GENERAL 1000 SPORT, RZR TURBO S LIFTED LIME LE, RZR PROXP ORANGE MADNESS LE & OUTLAW 70 EFI.
We design, engineer, produce or supply a variety of replacement parts and Polaris Engineered Accessories for our ORVs. ORV accessories include winches, bumper/brushguards, plows, racks, wheels and tires, pull-behinds, cab systems, lighting and audio systems, cargo box accessories, tracks and oil. We also market a full line of gear and apparel related to our ORVs, including helmets, jackets, gloves, pants and hats. Gear and apparel is designed to our specifications, purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers, distributors, and online.
We sell our ORVs directly to a network of over 1,400 dealers in North America and over 1,000 international dealers. Many of our ORV dealers and distributors are also authorized snowmobile dealers. We produce and deliver our products throughout the year based on dealer, distributor, and customer orders. ORV retail sales activity at the dealer level drives orders which are incorporated into each product’s production scheduling. International distributor ORV orders are taken throughout the year. We utilize our Retail Flow Management (RFM) ordering system for ORV dealers, which allows dealers to order daily and create a segment stocking order which reduces order fulfillment times. 
The ORV industry in the United States, Canada and other global markets is highly competitive. As an ORV original equipment manufacturer (OEM), our competition primarily comes from North American and Asian manufacturers. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. 
Snowmobiles: 
Snowmobiles have been manufactured under the Polaris name since 1954. We estimate that worldwide industry sales of snowmobiles totaled approximately 125,000, 135,000, and 125,000 units for the seasons ended March 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 
For the season ended March 31, 2020, we held the number two market share position for North America. We produce a full line of snowmobiles consisting of 80 models, ranging from youth models to utility and economy models to performance and competition models. Polaris snowmobiles are sold principally in the United States, Canada, Russia and Northern Europe. 2020 snowmobile product introductions included the all new Matryx Platform available with 7S display as well as the 650 Patriot Engine. Key models include the Polaris INDY VR1 129/137, Polaris INDY XC Launch Edition, Polaris SWITCHBACK ASSAULT 146, Polaris PRO RMK QD2, Polaris RMK KHAOS QD2.We also manufacture a snow bike conversion kit system under the Timbersled brand.
We design, engineer, produce or supply a variety of replacement parts and Polaris Engineered Accessories for our snowmobiles and snow bike conversion kits. Snowmobile accessories include covers, traction products, reverse kits, electric starters, tracks, bags, windshields, oil and lubricants. We also market a full line of gear and apparel for our snowmobiles, including helmets, goggles, jackets, gloves, boots, bibs, pants and hats. Gear and apparel is purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers, distributors, and online. 
We sell our snowmobiles directly to a network of approximately 600 dealers in North America, primarily located in the snowbelt regions of the United States and Canada, as well as and over 300 international dealers. We offer a pre-order SnowCheck program in the spring for our customers that assists us in production planning. This program allows our customers to order a true factory-customized snowmobile by selecting various options, including chassis, track, suspension, colors and accessories. Manufacturing of snowmobiles commences in late winter of the previous season and continues through late autumn or early winter of the current season.
The global Snowmobile industry is primarily comprised of North American, Japanese, and Russian competitors. Competitive market share position is driven heavily by product news (styling, technology, performance) and attractiveness of promotional incentives.
Motorcycles: 
Motorcycles are utilized as a mode of transportation as well as for recreational purposes. The industry is comprised of several segments. We currently compete in three segments: cruisers, touring (including 3-wheel), and standard motorcycles. Competition in these segments of the motorcycle industry is based on a number of factors, including styling, price, quality, reliability and the dealer network supporting the brand. 
Estimated combined 900cc and above cruiser, touring, and standard market segments (including the moto-roadster Slingshot®) motorcycle industry sales in North America and worldwide are summarized as follows:

 | Twelve months ended December 31,
Estimated* Industry Sales (in units) | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 
North America 900cc cruiser, touring, and standard retail sales | 190,000 | 210,000 | 210,000
Worldwide 900cc cruiser, touring, and standard retail sales | 330,000 | 365,000 | 370,000
*Estimates are unaudited and based on internally-generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third party surveys of the industries in which we compete. See Market and Industry Data section for additional information.

In 2020, we held the number two position in North America market share for the 900cc+ category. Our motorcycles lineup includes Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot, a 3-wheel open air roadster. Our 2021 model year line of motorcycles for Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot consists of 25 models. In 2020, Indian Motorcycle launched its all-new 2021 lineup delivering next-level technology and a robust suite of new accessories. Polaris Slingshot launched its much-anticipated AutoDrive transmission technology in the 2020 lineup, then expanded the 2021 lineup, which now includes a base model Slingshot S.
We design, engineer, produce or source a variety of replacement parts and accessories for our motorcycles. Motorcycle accessories include saddle bags, handlebars, backrests, exhausts, windshields, seats, oil and various chrome accessories. We also market a full line of gear and apparel for our motorcycles, including helmets, jackets, leathers and hats. Gear and apparel is purchased from independent vendors and sold by us through our dealers and distributors, and online under our brand names.
Indian Motorcycle and Slingshot are distributed directly through independently owned dealers and distributors. Indian motorcycles are sold through a network of over 200 North America and over 300 international dealers. Slingshot currently has over 350 dealers globally. We utilize our RFM ordering system for motorcycle dealers, which allows dealers to order daily and create a segment stocking order which reduces order fulfillment times. 
Global Adjacent Markets: 
Our Global Adjacent Markets business designs and manufacturers vehicles that support people mobility as well as various commercial work applications, and include products in the light-duty hauling, people mover, industrial and urban/suburban commuting sub-sectors, as well as tactical defense vehicles. As part of Global Adjacent Markets, our Polaris Adventures business partners with local outfitters to deliver unique ride experiences leveraging many of our global vehicle platforms. We estimate the worldwide target market for Polaris’ Global Adjacent Markets businesses was over $8.0 billion in 2020, which includes light duty hauling, people movers, industrial, rental, urban/suburban commuting and related quadricycles. 
Our vehicle brands include GEM, Goupil, Aixam, ProXD, and Taylor-Dunn, offering low emission vehicles, light duty hauling, passenger vehicles and industrial vehicles. Across these brands we offer 85 models. Global Adjacent Markets also includes all government, defense, and business-to-business (B2B) applications of ORV, Snowmobiles, and Motorcycles outside of our traditional dealer channels. For defense customers, we offer ATVs and side-by-side vehicles with features specifically designed for ultra-light tactical military applications. These vehicles provide versatile mobility for up to nine passengers, and include DAGOR, Sportsman MV and MRZR. 
Within Global Adjacent Markets, our businesses each have their own distribution networks through which their respective vehicles are distributed. GEM has approximately 200 dealers. ProXD is sold through a growing network of over 100 dealers and also direct to customer where permitted. Goupil and Aixam sell directly to customers in France, through subsidiaries in certain Western European countries and through several dealers and distributors for markets outside such countries. Taylor-Dunn has approximately 200 United States dealers and approximately 50 international dealers. The Polaris Adventures network completed over 270,000 rides in over 150 locations in 2020.
Aftermarket: 
Aftermarket parts, garments and accessories are sold through a highly fragmented industry, which includes dealers, aftermarket e-commerce, big box retailers, distributors and specialty 4x4 retailers. We estimate the market for Jeep and truck aftermarket accessories was approximately $9.0 billion in 2020, and the market for Powersports aftermarket parts, garments and accessories to be approximately $5.0 billion in 2020. 
Our aftermarket portfolio of brands include Transamerican Auto Parts (“TAP”), which is a vertically integrated manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep and truck accessories. TAP owned brands include 4WP, 4 Wheel Parts, Pro Comp, Smittybilt, Rubicon Express, G2 Axle & Gear, Poison Spyder, Trail Master, 4WP Factory, and LRG. We compete primarily in North America and our competition is highly fragmented across the retail and online channels. TAP sells through its retail stores, call center, and e-commerce sites, while also supporting numerous independent accessory retailers/installers through their wholesale distribution network. TAP conducts business through a three-pronged sales, service, and manufacturing paradigm. TAP has 95 brick-and-mortar retail centers, staffed with experienced product and installation specialists. TAP’s omni-channel retail strategy includes a significant e-commerce business with 4WheelParts.com and 4WD.com. The TAP e-commerce network facilitates consumer sales, service and support, including “pick-up-in-store.” 
Other brands within our aftermarket portfolio include Kolpin, Pro Armor, Klim, 509, and Trail Tech. Aftermarket brands in our off-road category include Kolpin, a lifestyle brand specializing in purpose-built and universal-fit accessories for a variety of off-road vehicles and off-road outdoor enthusiasts, and Pro Armor, a lineup that specializes in accessories for performance side-by-side vehicles and ATVs. Aftermarket brands in our Apparel category include Klim, which specializes in premium technical riding gear for snowmobile, motorcycle and off-road activities, and 509, which is an aftermarket leader in snowmobile and Offroad apparel, helmets and goggles. Kolpin Outdoors, Pro Armor and Trail Tech are marketed through Apex Product Group, a unified sales, customer service, distribution and vertically integrated manufacturing organization. Apex brands allow us to access customers through strategic retail and e-commerce marketplaces, as well as dealerships (Polaris and non-Polaris) to reach owners of Polaris and other OEM’s products. Klim and 509 each have their own dealer/distributor networks. 
Boats: 
On July 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Boat Holdings, LLC, a privately held Delaware limited liability company, headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana which manufactures boats. As a result, we established the Boats operating segment.
Our boats are designed to compete in key segments of the recreational marine industry, primarily pontoon and deck boats. Inclusive of the segments in which we compete, we estimate total U.S. 2020 powerboats market sales were approximately $13.0 billion, with pontoon being one of the largest segments therein.
Our brands include Bennington, Godfrey, and Hurricane, with a full offering of pontoon and deck boats. These brands are strategically positioned with over 500 base models across a range of price points. We also offer custom layouts and features and work with numerous engine manufacturers enabling customers to build exactly what they want. In 2020, Polaris Boats, including the Bennington and Godfrey brands, is projected to be the market share leader in pontoon boats and our Hurricane brand the market share leader in deck boats.
In a highly fragmented industry, our extensive, experienced and loyal network of over 600 active dealers is a competitive advantage, helping to generate steady demand. Concentrated primarily in North America, this dealer network is organized into distinct sales territories supported by experienced sales representatives and leadership. Through the use of offseason incentive programs, we adhere to level production throughout the year, minimizing disruption to the workforce and vendor network. 
Financial Services Arrangements
Floor plan financing. We have arrangements with Polaris Acceptance (United States), a joint venture between Polaris and a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo affiliates (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China and New Zealand), and TCF Financial Corporation (“TCF”) to provide floor plan financing for many of our dealers. A majority of our North America sales of snowmobiles, ORVs, motorcycles, boats, and related PG&A are financed under these arrangements whereby we are paid within a few days of shipment of our product. We participate in the cost of dealer financing and have agreed to repurchase products from the finance companies under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. We have not historically been required to repurchase a significant number of units. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these financial services arrangements.
Customer financing. We do not offer consumer financing directly to the end users of our products. Instead, we have agreements in place with third party financing companies to provide financing services to those end consumers.
We have a multi-year agreement with Sheffield Financial (“Sheffield”) pursuant to which Sheffield agreed to make available closed-end installment consumer and commercial credit to customers of our dealers for Polaris products. The current installment credit agreement under which Sheffield provides installment credit lending for ORVs, snowmobiles, and certain other Polaris products expires in December 2024.
We have a multi-year agreement with Evergreen Bank Group, under which Performance Finance, as a division of Evergreen Bank Group, makes available closed-end installment credit to customers of our dealers for both Polaris and non-Polaris products. The current installment credit agreement under which Performance Finance provides installment credit lending for Polaris and non-Polaris products expires in December 2021.
We have a multi-year contract with Synchrony Bank, under which Synchrony Bank makes available closed-end installment consumer and commercial credit to customers of our dealers for both Polaris and non-Polaris products. The current installment credit agreement under which Synchrony Bank provides installment credit lending for Polaris products expires in December 2025.
Manufacturing and Distribution Operations 
Our products are primarily assembled at our 20 global manufacturing facilities, many of which are shared across business segments. We are vertically integrated in several key components of our manufacturing process, including plastic injection molding, precision machining, welding, clutch assembly and painting. Certain other component parts are purchased from third-party vendors. Raw materials or standard parts are available from multiple sources for the components manufactured by us. Polaris Boats has a long-term supply contract with an engine manufacturer, which requires a certain volume of total engine purchases, and includes favorable pricing, as well as various growth and volume incentives.  
Contract carriers ship our products from our manufacturing and distribution facilities to our customers. We maintain several leased wholegoods distribution centers where final set-up and up-fitting is completed for certain models before shipment to dealers, distributors, and customers. 
Our products are distributed to our dealers, distributors, and customers through a network of over 30 distribution centers, including third-party providers. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our marketing activities are designed primarily to promote and communicate with consumers to enable the marketing and selling efforts of our dealers and distributors globally. We make available and advertise discount or rebate programs, retail financing or other incentives for our dealers and distributors to remain price competitive to accelerate retail sales to consumers. We advertise our brands directly to consumers via digital, television, print, out of home, radio, events and sponsorships. We utilize public relations and partnerships to drive earned media. We provide advertising assets and content and partially underwrite dealer and distributor advertising to a degree and on terms which vary by brand and from year to year. We also provide print materials, signage and other promotional items for use by dealers. We spent $544.3 million, $559.2 million and $491.8 million for sales and marketing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our corporate headquarters facility is in Medina, Minnesota, and we maintain over 30 other sales and administrative facilities across the world.
Engineering, Research and Development, and New Product Introduction 
We have approximately 1,300 employees who are engaged in the development and testing of existing products and research and development of new products and improved production techniques, located primarily in Roseau, Minnesota, Wyoming, Minnesota, Chula Vista, California, Elkhart, Indiana, and Burgdorf, Switzerland. 
We utilize internal combustion engine testing facilities to design engine configurations for our products. We utilize specialized facilities for matching engine, exhaust system and clutch performance parameters in our products to achieve desired fuel consumption, power output, noise level and other objectives. Further, we are currently executing an electrification initiative to position the Company as a leader in powersports electrification. Our engineering department is equipped to make small quantities of new product prototypes for testing and for the planning of manufacturing procedures. In addition, we maintain numerous facilities where each of the products is extensively tested under actual use conditions. We utilize our Wyoming, Minnesota facility for engineering, design and development personnel for our line of engines and powertrains, ORVs, motorcycles, and certain Global Adjacent Market vehicles, and our Roseau, Minnesota facility for our snowmobile, ATV and powertrain research and development. We utilize our Elkhart, Indiana facility for engineering, design and development for our boats research and development. We also own Swissauto 
Powersports Ltd., an engineering company that develops high performance and high efficiency engines and innovative vehicles. 
Intellectual Property 
Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global operations include POLARIS, RANGER, RZR, GENERAL, SPORTSMAN, INDIAN MOTORCYCLE, SLINGSHOT, BENNINGTON, KLIM, and 4 WHEEL PARTS. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.
We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, trade secrets, and know-how. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
Product Safety & Regulatory Affairs
Product safety regulations. Federal, state/provincial and local governments around the world have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the safety of our products. For example, in the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to snowmobiles, snow-bikes and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to motorcycles (including Slingshot) and on-road people mobility vehicles (including GEM). The U.S. Coast Guard (part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security) is the federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. 
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the Act) requires ATV manufacturers and distributors to comply with previously voluntary American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety standards developed by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (SVIA). The Act also requires CPSC to update the mandatory standard (if it deems doing so to be appropriate) based on updates to the voluntary ANSI/SVIA standards, which has occurred.  The Act also includes a provision that requires the CPSC to complete an ongoing ATV rulemaking process regarding the need for safety standards or increased safety standards for ATVs. This process has not yet resulted in the issuance of a final rule.  We believe that our products comply with all applicable CPSC, ANSI and/or SVIA safety standards as well as all other applicable safety standards in the U.S. or internationally. In addition, we have had an action plan on file with the CPSC since 1998 regarding safety related issues.
In October 2009, the CPSC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding side-by-side vehicle, also known as Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle (ROV), safety under the Consumer Product Safety Act. In December 2014, the CPSC published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that includes proposed mandatory safety standards for ROVs in the areas of lateral stability, steering and handling, and occupant retention. Polaris and powersports industry associations have expressed concerns about the proposed mandatory standards, whether they would actually reduce ROV incident rates, whether the proposed tests are repeatable and appropriate for ROVs, and the unintended safety consequences that could result from them. As a result of those concerns, revisions to voluntary industry standards were proposed. In 2015, CPSC staff expressed support for the proposed 2016 revisions to the ANSI standard, and subsequently recommended that the CPSC terminate its rule-making process. We are unable to predict the outcome of the CPSC rule-making process or the ultimate impact of any resulting rules on our business and operating results.
We are a member of the Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association (ROHVA), which was established to promote the safe and responsible use of ROVs, a category that includes our RANGER, Polaris GENERAL, and RZR vehicles. ROHVA develops, through ANSI, voluntary standards for equipment, configuration and performance requirements of ROVs. Comments on the draft standards have been actively solicited from the CPSC and other stakeholders as part of the ANSI process. The standard, which addresses stability, occupant retention and other safety performance criteria, was approved and published by ANSI.  We believe that our products comply with all applicable ROHVA/ANSI safety standards, as well as all other applicable safety standards in the U.S. or internationally.
Motorcycles and certain people mobility vehicles are subject to certain U.S. and foreign vehicle safety and equipment standards, including those standards administered by the NHTSA. Our products and their operators are also subject to various international state and local vehicle equipment and safety standards. Our products are occasionally classified differently in various international jurisdictions. For example, our Slingshot vehicle is classified as a motorcycle under 
U.S. federal law, but may be classified differently in other jurisdictions. At the state level in the U.S., in approximately 48 states the Slingshot is classified as an autocycle, which permits it to be driven with a standard drivers license. We believe our motorcycles (including Slingshot), people mobility vehicles, and all other of our on-road products comply with all applicable U.S and international safety and equipment standards pursuant to each product’s classification.
Our Boats products are subject to marine safety regulations for vessels developed and enforced by the U.S. Coast Guard and its foreign equivalents. We believe that our marine products comply with all applicable U.S. and international safety, design, construction and equipment standards. We are committed to improving recreational boating safety, we maintain strong leadership roles in many international maritime organizations, and we have supported and continue to support a variety of government and nongovernment boating safety efforts in partnership with government agencies and marine industry associations.
Industry Associations. We participate in a number of industry associations relating to our products, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association, the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, the Motorcycle Industry Council, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the U.S. Motorcycle Manufacturers Association, the International Motorcycle Manufacturers Association, ACEM, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, and the American Boat & Yacht Council. These associations focus on key issues affecting the manufacture, marketing, and use of our products, including safety standards. We believe our products comply with the applicable industry standards established within these associations.
Product use regulations. Federal, state/provincial and local laws and regulations around the world have been promulgated, and at various times, ordinances or legislation is introduced, relating to the use or manner of use of our products. Some government entities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws that restrict the use of ORVs and snowmobiles to specified hours and locations. For example, the U.S. federal government also has legislative and executive authority to restrict the use of ORVs, snowmobiles and other products in national parks and on federal lands. In several instances, this restriction has been a ban on the recreational use of these products in these areas.
Environmental regulations. Federal, state/provincial and local governments around the world have adopted and/or are considering adopting laws relating to the reduction or elimination of certain substances and materials in consumer products and the reduction of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations are an important component of global environmental and climate protection, and therefore form a key regulatory framework in the design of our products.
For example, in the United States, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have both adopted regulations in these areas which are applicable to certain of our products. Canada’s emission regulations for motorcycles, ORVs and snowmobiles are similar to those in the United States. The Europe Union currently regulates emissions from our motorcycles and certain of our ATV-based products for which we obtain whole vehicle type approvals. Emissions from certain other Polaris ORV and snowmobile engines in vehicles sold in the EU may be subject to additional regulations currently under consideration there. We are developing compliance solutions for these future EU emissions regulations. We are also currently developing and obtaining engine and emission technologies to meet the requirements of future anticipated international emission standards.
Human Capital Management
Best People, Best Team is a Polaris guiding principle. Our employees are also among our largest shareholder groups, driven by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan and our equity compensation program. Our greatest asset is our employees and we are committed to providing a diverse and engaging work environment. With almost 15,000 employees globally at the end of 2020, we aim to leverage our Polaris values to drive a positive culture. 
Employee Well Being. We believe the physical health, safety, and financial security of our employees is critical to our success and it is a key focus of our guiding principles. Over the last year, the strength of our team was displayed through the agile response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which also offered an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to employee well-being. Polaris’ culture of safety first prepared us to identify and adopt safety controls to protect employees working onsite. We developed a broad set of resources and communications to educate our employees on safety both within and outside of the work environment. Our COVID-19 Pay Policy for US employees provided additional financial security for those impacted by illness or quarantine. With employee well-being as a key focus, we shared resources for employees to manage remote work, support mental health, and balance parental and other family responsibilities.
Leadership Development. As a part of our growth strategy, we are committed to strategically and intentionally developing our current employees to become the next generation of leaders through external partnerships and employee development programs such as Succeeding as a Polaris Leader and Polaris Leadership Development 1 and 2. These programs provide high potential employees opportunities to grow and prepare for next-level roles. In 2020, our investment in leadership development continued. We scaled virtual leadership training to a larger number of leaders than prior years and disseminated tools for managing remote teams.
We also remained committed to focused development for early career talent. We revamped our 2020 intern programs to support both onsite and remote interns, launching development programs across the hybrid workforce. We believe our intern programs provide a strong talent pipeline to our early career functional development programs across engineering, operations, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and information services. Each development program consists of structured rotations and additional formal development, accelerating our talent pipeline.
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is another focus of our guiding principle of Best People, Best Team. Fostering an environment that ensures equal opportunity and truly values individual differences is critical to the success of our business. Polaris thrives when it empowers and values the unique skills, perspectives and contributions of each employee. In 2020, we made a corporate commitment to the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity & Inclusion, which outlines specific sets of actions designed to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. To further this work, we created a Diversity and Inclusion Steering Team to accelerate our progress. We partnered with external training organizations to drive a culture of inclusion, including a partnership with Franklin Covey for interactive training for all employees at the Director+ level in the company. In addition to other actions, we joined the Corporate Partnership Council of the Society of Women Engineers to promote opportunities for development for our team, as well as to build a pipeline for future talent.
Headcount. Due to the seasonality of our business and certain changes in production cycles, total employment levels vary throughout the year. Despite such variations in employment levels, employee turnover has not been materially disruptive to operations. As of December 31, 2020, on a worldwide basis, we employed almost 15,000 full-time persons. Approximately 5,000 of our full-time employees are salaried. 
Market and Industry Data
We have obtained the market and industry data presented in this year’s Annual Report from a combination of internal surveys, third party information and estimates by management. There are limited sources that report on our markets and industries. As such, much of the market and industry data presented in this year’s Annual Report is based on internally-generated management estimates, including estimates based on extrapolations from third party surveys of the industries in which we compete. While we believe internal surveys, third party information and our estimates are reliable, we have not verified them, nor have they been verified by any independent sources and we have no assurance that the information contained in third party websites is current, up-to date, or accurate. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the market and industry data presented in this Annual Report, whether any such future-looking data will be accurate involves risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those factors discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements and in our Risk Factors.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This 2020 Annual Report contains not only historical information, but also “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These “forward-looking 
statements” can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we or our management “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates” or words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals, such as future sales, shipments, net income, net income per share, future cash flows and capital requirements, operational initiatives, tariffs, currency fluctuations, interest rates, and commodity costs, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements, are also forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may also be made from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public. 
Potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the Company’s business, supply chain, and the global economy; the Company’s ability to successfully implement its manufacturing operations expansion and supply chain initiatives, product offerings, promotional activities and pricing strategies by competitors; the Company’s ability to successfully source necessary parts and materials and the ability of the Company to manufacture and deliver products to dealers to meet increasing demand and to bring dealer inventory levels back to optimal levels; the continuation of the increasing consumer demand for the Company’s products; economic conditions that impact consumer spending; disruptions in manufacturing facilities; acquisition integration costs; product recalls, warranty expenses; impact of changes in Polaris stock price on incentive compensation plan costs; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; environmental and product safety regulatory activity; effects of weather; commodity costs; freight and tariff costs (tariff relief or ability to mitigate tariffs); changes to international trade policies and agreements; uninsured product liability claims; uncertainty in the retail and wholesale credit markets; performance of affiliate partners; changes in tax policy; relationships with dealers and suppliers; and the general overall economic, social, and political environment. 
The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties. 
Any forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. We advise you, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in future quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K that are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
