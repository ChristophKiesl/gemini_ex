At all times prior to the First Reduction Date (as defined below), the Guarantors are collectively responsible for 30% of the Principal Obligations, (ii) at all times after the First Reduction Date, the Guarantors are collectively responsible for15% of the Principal Obligations, and (iii) at all times after the Second Reduction Date, 0% of the Principal Obligations.

Liquidity is defined as the sum of unencumbered, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and (2) net worth shall not be less than $10 million.

The Company’s portfolio of REIT marketable securities consists primarily of preferred equity of large capital publicly traded REITs with a market value of approximately $1.66 million as of December 31, 2020.
 
The Company’s investments in non-REIT marketable securities include equity and debt securities issued primarily by large capital companies or government agencies with readily determinable fair values in varying industries. This includes real estate investment trusts and mutual funds focusing in commercial real estate activities. Substantially all the Company’s marketable securities investments are in companies listed on major national stock markets, however the overall investment portfolio and some of the Company’s investment strategies could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to fluctuations. Consistent with the Company’s overall investment objectives and activities, management classifies all marketable securities as being held in a trading portfolio. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investments in marketable securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable securities are stated at market value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. Information regarding the amounts and types of investments in marketable securities is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Company may realize gains and losses in its overall investment portfolio from time to time to take advantage of market conditions and/or manage the portfolio’s resources and the Company’s tax liability. The Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases using standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The use of available leverage is guided by the business judgment of management. The Company may also use options and futures to hedge concentrated stock positions and index futures to hedge against market risk and enhance the performance of the Company’s portfolio while reducing the overall portfolio’s risk and volatility.
 
The Company’s other investments consist primarily of nominal equity interests in various privately held entities, including limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest venture capital funds in growth-oriented enterprises. The Company does not have significant influence over any investee and the Company’s investments typically represent less than 5% of the investee’s ownership. Some of these investments give rise to exposure resulting from the volatility in capital markets. The Company mitigates its risks by diversifying its investment portfolio. Information with respect to the amounts and types of other investments including the nature of the declines in value is set forth in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Reference is made to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence for discussion of the Company’s organizational structure and related party transactions.
