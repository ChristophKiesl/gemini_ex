The significant quantity of oil and gas wells in the Barnett Shale of Texas combined with the presence of produced water (salt water) and other fluids in the production process creates demand for disposal services such as those services provided by us.
 
Recent Developments
 
On December 12, 2019, we entered into a Reorganization and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) to change our corporate domicile from Texas to Nevada, assume the name TRICCAR, Inc. (“TRICCAR”), and to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of TRICCAR Holdings, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“TRICCAR Holdings”).
 
TRICCAR acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of TRICCAR Holdings. TRICCAR issued 80,000,000 shares of stock to acquire all the issued and outstanding equity stock of TRICCAR Holdings while TRICCAR shareholders retained 20,000,000 shares of stock.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
Through May 14, 2021, TRICCAR was a biomedical research, development, and marketing firm whose focus was to develop, acquire, and partner to bring bioceutical solutions (not requiring FDA approval) and pharmaceutical drugs (requiring FDA approval) to the market. The Company was in the development stage of bioceutical and pharmaceutical products designed to support the well-being of humans and animals that have common diseases.
 On May 14, 2021, TRICCAR and TRICCAR Holdings entered into a Mutual Rescission Agreement and General Release (“Rescission Agreement”), pursuant to which the Reorganization and Stock Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) entered into by and between the TRICCAR and TRICCAR Holdings on December 12, 2019 was rescinded. Pursuant to the terms of the Rescission Agreement, the 80,000,000 shares that were to be issued to the shareholders of TRICCAR Holdings will be returned by the shareholders of TRICCAR Holdings and in exchange therefor, TRICCAR will return the shares of TRICCAR Holdings it received to the shareholders of TRICCAR Holdings and the Company will disclaim any right, title and/or interest in or to any shares of capital stock of TRICCAR Holdings.
 
Effective December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an asset exchange and purchase agreement with Kenneth Owens, a note holder and stockholder of the Company at the time of the transaction, for the transfer of all our assets located in Wise County, Texas in exchange for the cancellation of $4.6 million in debt owed to Mr. Owens by the Company and the return of 2,701,168 shares of our common stock owned by Mr. Owens.
 At the closing of the transaction, Mr. Owens did not accept the transfer of three of the SWD wells located in Wise County, Texas.  The SWD’s are as follows: Trull 1, Trull 2 and CSWU 1202. As a result, the Company never transferred these three SWD wells to Mr. Owens. The leases for these three SWD wells are in default and there is no current disposal activity or revenues from these SWDs. We are in the process of entering into negotiations with the lessors to restart these leases. The Company has continued to provide regulatory compliance reporting and maintenance services for these three SWD wells. On December 31, 2019, the Company had an existing operating and management agreement with Elysian Fields Disposal LLC to serve as operator, management and consultant of various field operational assets. Under the contract agreement, Elysian Fields has the authority to operate the wells and provide accounting and regulatory compliance reporting services through itself or other qualified sub-contractors. While the SWD wells are not commercially operating and the leases are currently in default, this agreement remains in place for the three SWD wells continue to be maintained pursuant to the terms of the operating and management agreement. Elysian Fields is an affiliate of Newton Dorsett, our largest stockholder and was paid $60,000 in fees during 2020 by the Company. See Related Party footnote 7.
 In connection with the sale of TRICCAR Holdings, TRICCAR’s management team and two members of its Board of Directors resigned, and Matthew Flemming was appointed to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and as a member of the board of directors.
 
Outlook
 
The Company has several years of history in the operations and development of saltwater disposal wells. Management currently believes the oil and gas industry outlook is positive and increasing activity levels which in turn drives more demand for our saltwater disposal services.

IHS Markit estimates the US oilfield water management to be valued at around $37 billion in 2019, representing a 12% year-on-year (y/y) market growth from 2018; this is mainly driven by water disposal and water logistics. The Permian Basin continues to produce and demand the largest volume of oilfield water among all US onshore regions, with water spending in the region estimated at $13.3 billion in 2019.
 
Figure 1: Market size, by play ($ billion)
 Within the value chain of the water management market, water logistics continues to be the largest segment. Indeed, logistics are expected to make up 60% of spending in 2019 with water hauling services the main driver in that category.
 
Right behind water logistics is water disposal. As hydrocarbon production continues to increase, mainly due to Permian Basin activities, produced water is projected to follow the same trend. As a result, the water disposal market should continue growing at a 6% compound average growth rate (CAGR) through 2024. However, this growth could be limited if the disposal challenges in the Permian Basin are not addressed by both operators and third-party companies.
 
Permian water disposal volumes contribute to more than 30% of the total disposed volumes in the onshore US, and in fact they have increased more than 40% between 2010 and 2019. In addition, disposal volumes in West Texas are expected to reach the highest level recorded in the last five years during 2019.
 
Development and Operating Activities
 
Economic conditions in the oil and gas industry are subject to volatility. The uncertain nature of these economic conditions combined with federal and state regulatory uncertainty in the energy industry requires operators to be flexible and adept at adjusting operations and strategy to achieve profitability. We intend to evaluate all conditions and risks affecting our operating activities and to respond to those conditions by employing resources in areas we believe to have the most potential for success. The oil field service industry has been and will continue to be affected by the volatility in oil and natural gas prices and may experience lower revenues as oil producers’ pressure oil field service providers for lower cost service.
 
The Company’s business requires capital to fund operations and growth. In order to adequately fund operating activities, we may need to secure additional capital from third parties or other debt or equity financing sources. There

can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are acceptable. There are also no assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability from our operations in the current market environment.
 
General Regulations
 
Both state and federal authorities regulate the transportation and disposal of salt water, produced fluids and drilling fluids. The executive and legislative branches of government at both the state and federal levels have periodically proposed the establishment of controls on saltwater disposal, environmental protection, as well as various other related programs affecting the saltwater disposal business. If any further legislation is promulgated related to the disposal of salt water, produced fluids or drilling fluids, such legislation could have a material effect on our operations.
Federal Regulatory Actions
 
Federal legislation has also been introduced which may have an effect on the use of hydraulic fracturing to increase oil and gas production, primarily in shale formations, due to concerns related to potential contamination of drinking water supplies.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel. In addition, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation generally of hydraulic fracturing in the United States under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
 
The Company’s operations are located in areas where hydraulic fracturing is used as the primary method of establishing and developing oil and gas producing wells. These areas are also where the majority of the Company’s revenues are generated as these producing wells also generate salt water and other fluids as by-products of the oil and gas producing process. Any regulation inhibiting or prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing may have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
State Regulatory Controls
 
The State of Texas (where we operate) regulates the operation and permitting associated with the transport and disposal of salt water and other produced fluids. Because we are primarily engaged in saltwater, produced fluids and drilling fluid disposal activities, our operations are subject to inspection and permitting by authorities of the State of Texas. There have been recent regulatory and legislative proposals related to concerns with potential water supply contamination potentially be caused by hydraulic fracturing operations.
Environmental Regulations
 
Our salt water and other fluids disposal operations are subject to environmental protection regulations established by federal, state, and local agencies. We believe we are in compliance with the applicable environmental regulations established by these agencies with jurisdiction over our operations. Certain environmental regulations currently in effect could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or prospects for profitability if we received a determination from one of these agencies that our operations are not in compliance. The Texas Legislature has mandated a regulatory program for the management of hazardous wastes generated during crude oil and natural gas exploration and production, gas processing, oil and gas waste reclamation, saltwater disposal and transportation operations. The disposal of these wastes, as governed by the Railroad Commission of Texas, is subject to the supervision of state of Texas authorities. Our disposal operations are also subject to inspection and regulation by state and federal environmental authorities.
