Item 1. Business.
Our Plan of Business
 
Major League Football, Inc. (the “Company”) plans to establish, develop and operate Major League Football (“MLFB”) as a professional Spring/Summer football League with 6 initial Franchises located in cities overlooked in large part by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with high quality players and competition in the NFL’s off-season. Our plan is that teams will be located in Ohio, Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, and Florida.  Our spring playing schedule avoids all competition with the NFL and colleges.  Our search committee has located multiple cities with both a passion for sports and football as well as stadium venues whose size will provide our fans an excellent viewing experience at a reasonable rental expense to MLFB. All potential venues are equipped for high quality multi-platform media transmission allowing us the broadcast all our games in multi-levels of today’s technology. We have commenced the process of leasing these venues and have acquired all the necessary football and related equipment to fully outfit 8 + teams, including some of the latest technology for use by our coaches and players. The Alliance of American Football (“AAF”), whose equipment we acquired, has ceased operations and the XFL, which played five games in 2020 before filing for bankruptcy re-organization, has announced plans to restart in 2023. The Spring League is not considered a football league, as the players pay its ownership to play in it, hoping for NFL or other teams recognition. We believe because the Spring League has no player payroll costs, quality players will jump at a chance to be paid a salary in MLFB.
 
Both the AAF and XFL validated MLFB’s concept that there was a demand for football in the Spring, drawing excellent attendance averaging 15,000 with high TV ratings and outdrawing the NBA on several occasions. We believe that there are thousands of quality football players available to MLFB and the NFL releases over 1,000 players every September. We believe that the lack of financial success by the AAF and perhaps the XFL is directly attributable to excessive payroll, stadium, and other overhead related expenses and not the concept itself. MLFB will serve as a pipeline to further develop players skills, on and off the field, as well as a training ground for young coaches, officials and all associated with the industry. NFL Europe did just this during its existence.
 
MLFB is in the process of hiring several well-known and experienced coaches, scouts, and trainers as well as individuals looking to improve their skills in these areas. We believe this will provide MLFB with the recognition and credibility to demonstrate the viability of our economic model as well as the market’s desire for spring football. Management, as noted in a recent Form 8-K filing, studied in depth the possibility of having a Demonstration Season in the summer of 2021 as a means of introducing MLFB as a league and overcoming some of the difficulties encountered because of Covid-19. While the pandemic has gradually eased and  crowd capacities increased, this occurred too late in the process to commence a Demonstration Season. In addition, our analysis of the cost for playing three games plus television, exceeded $3 million. As anxious as we, our shareholders and fans are to get started, management and our Board of Directors believe that the cost/ reward ratio and time challenges dictated that we allocate those resources to our planned 2022 football season.  This would include preparation for a launch with training camp beginning in April 2022. The Demonstration Season was probably going to generate minimal revenue and we did not want to rush our product to the field. Covid-19 remediation costs were still going to be high but are trending down as new detection products come on the market. While frustrating to many constituents, our management style has been cautious, and its cornerstone has been to minimize known risks. We believe that the planned spring 2022 football season will allow us to put an economically sustainable league and product on the field and one in which our shareholders can be proud for years.

We require short-term financing as well as financing over the next 12 months and as noted in previous filings, the Company has been pursuing short term financing of approximately $3 million followed by a tiered subsequent raise of approximately $27 million between the end of calendar 2021 and the first calendar quarter of 2022.  However, as discussed previously, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully obtain the required capital in this timeframe.
 
The Company has engaged the services of a well-known and respected investment bank headquartered in New York to assist in that effort. In addition, our management has been engaged with several high net-worth individuals and funds who have expressed an interest in being part of our League as investors. However, the funds required or received by the Company at this time may be substantially less than the $27 million referred to above. 
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our“ or “us“ and other similar terms collectively means Major League Football, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal offices are presently located at 15515 Lemon Fish Drive, Lakewood Ranch, Florida, 34202. Our telephone number is (847) 924-4332 and (941) 210-7546. Our Internet website is currently located at: www.mlfb.com.
 
Single Entity Structure
 
We intend to operate the league as a single entity owned, stand alone, independent sports league. The single entity structure will be based on the design of Major League Soccer (MLS), where a single entity sports league owns and operates all of its teams. This corporate structure provides several compelling benefits, including:

· | Centralized contracting for ‘players’ services for controlled payrolls without violating antitrust laws
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Greater parity among teams 
· | Focus on the bottom line 
· | Controlled costs 

 
Management believes that this structure will also promote efficiency by depoliticizing decisions on league policies and allowing decisions to be made with consistency and in a timely fashion. Economies of scale will be achieved through centralizing contract negotiations and handling business affairs in the league office to ensure that individual teams are unified in their decision-making. Further, under this structure, we expect teams will operate in the best interest of the league. 
 
MLFB Market Opportunity
 
MLFB intends to establish a brand that is fan-friendly, exciting, affordable, and interactive, but most importantly provides consumers real value for their sports dollars. MLFB will underscore the fans’ access to team members, coaches, league officials and other fans. Although MLFB’s ticket pricing will be a fraction of that of the established professional leagues (NBA, MLB, NHL, and NFL), its ultimate goal will be to offer its fans an incomparable value-added experience for their entertainment dollar.
 
Additionally, as a result of a carefully crafted study, we will not locate teams in any established NFL cities and more importantly in any Major League Baseball cities, thus avoiding direct in-season competition with an established sports entity. By positioning teams in prime emerging and under-represented markets throughout the contiguous 48 states (including placing teams in well respected and football fan friendly metropolitan markets in the country), our research suggests that an exciting sports entity like Major League Football will be viewed in a positive light by sports fans throughout the US. Of equal or greater importance to Major League Football is the fact that both established and peripheral football fans in these exciting new markets will finally be afforded the opportunity of establishing their own personal sports identity while at the same time fostering strong community pride.

Lastly, although MLFB’s long-range vision is to maintain a positive working relationship with the NFL, its ultimate intent is to function as an independent, stand-alone entity that captures sports content needed during off season. Although its economic model was, we believe, flawed, the professional Alliance of American Football teams drew a League wide average attendance of 15,000 fans per game and television ratings comparable to the NBA. The XFL had similar positive attendance in its five-game season.
 
MLFB intends to disseminate its message using a comprehensive marketing strategy that employs both traditional and new media marketing channels. MLFB’s marketing plans are anticipated to create multiple revenue streams and engage sports fans over a variety of mediums. Specifically, MLFB intends to develop a far-reaching Internet and mobile strategy that will serve as the backbone of its marketing strategy. This will include developing a mobile initiative, where fans can interact with the league, its players, its coaches, and other fans using their mobile phones all while taking advantage of the player name recognition that comes with fantasy football.
 
MLFB also intends to create an interactive website that includes a social networking aspect, podcasts, live video, and more. Along with this new media strategy, cross promotions will also be an important part of the MLFB’s marketing strategy. MLFB plans to work with businesses involved in video, television, print media and the Internet to promote its business. Much of the necessary preliminary work to meet this new strategy has already been performed by our previously announced external contractors, BDB Entertainment Group, Inc., and Red Moon Marketing. 
 
We intend to review their qualifications and believe that the cumulative effect of this work will help it achieve its early objectives, which include the following:
 

· | Establish itself as a recognized professional football league 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build a base of teams and fans broad enough to sustain business over the critical first five years of operation
· | Generate enough revenue to expand its operations in years three through six 
· | Build successful teams located in regions where there are no existing MLB franchises 
· | Adopt a spring schedule to avoid competing with NFL, collegiate and prep football 
· | Provide year-round cash flow from multi-functioning revenue streams 
· | Build a positive image for the league through year-round community relations campaigns 

Professional Sports Market
 
MLFB recognizes the NFL is the dominant professional sports league in the United States. Although it clearly respects the success of the NFL business model, MLFB’s defined objective is to position itself as an independent, non-adversarial football league. MLFB believes that its own business model encompasses innovations that will be viewed positively by NFL officials, resulting in a strong working relationship between the two leagues. MLFB staff have held meetings with high-ranking NFL officials to discuss our plans.

MLFB will endeavor to maximize ticket vendor technology and enhance its services to patrons with innovative ticketing procedures that include:
 

· | Average ticket prices targeted at approximately 25% of the prices of NFL, NBA, NHL & MLB tickets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Year-round cash flow from multiple revenue streams utilizing new technologies. 
· | A highly developed marketing strategy that uses both traditional and new media to attract existing football fans as well as an entirely untapped market of potential new fans.
· | A more interactive website in professional sports using cutting edge technologies to preserve fan loyalty. 
· | Proven executive staff members with considerable practical experience in professional football. 
· | Player and coaching costs projected significantly less than those of the NFL, NBA, NHL, or MLB. 

 
Initially, teams will operate in either existing collegiate or municipal stadiums during the spring and early summer season. We believe that our business model and long-range vision possess many innovations that will be viewed in a positive light by NFL owners and league officials and will also lend itself to the potential of establishing a strong working relationship with our venture by positioning ourselves in a 100% non-adversarial position to the established NFL.
 
Audience
 
MLFB believes that today’s market demands a controlled deliverable to a targeted viewing audience as well as controlled advertising deliverables to specific targeted demographic audiences as well. Other sports attract audiences that are only a fraction of that number, in producing the sponsor and advertiser concerns. Therefore, retaining the mass appeal needed to attract such an audience is an over-arching consideration that shapes much of what we do and what concerns the Company.
Merchandising & Licensing Overview
 
The thrust of our licensing and co-branding strategy is to create an increase in brand value for MLFB and the partners we align with. In order for the league to have a robust licensing and co-branding business, we have created a 3-tier approach that focuses on generating strong revenue streams for the league and initiating value based collaborative efforts that further enhance the MLFB brand.
 
The main benefits of the program are:
 

· | Fans will find quality items at more favorable price points. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Teams will have higher profit on items and stop tying up money on inventory they cannot’ properly sell.
· | More fans will be wearing and supporting the team and league branded merchandise. 

 
We plan to develop private label products where we will feature products that are fan favorites (hats, shirts, popular novelties, and gifts, etc.) all manufactured at the highest level, and priced below traditional licensed sports merchandise programs. All merchandise, when league sanctioned, will be pre- ticketed and priced.  
 
 Timeline of Significant Events

On August 23, 2018, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation such that all 200,000,000 authorized shares shall be designated as common stock and the prior authorized designated 50,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share were converted to common stock. As a result, the Company has no authorized preferred stock.

On February 15, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000. 
 
Effective October 30, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized shares of common stock from 300,000,000 to 450,000,000.
 
Effective November 3, 2020, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized shares of common stock from 450,000,000 to 600,000,000.
 
For the three amendments above increasing three authorized shares of common stock, written consent in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware was not adhered to. Given the exigent circumstances of the need to raise money imminently to save the Company and fund its primary business, the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock entitled to vote as a class, were not provided written notice of the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Company did not conduct a vote of the shareholders in favor of the adoption of the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. As a result, there is a risk that the State of Delaware could notify the Company that the amendments were not valid.
 
On February 18, 2020, in furtherance of the Company’s desire to sustain and grow the business, the Sole Officer of the Company, pursuant to a Corporate Resolution, appointed himself as Contract President, Chief Executive Officer and Director to serve until the annual shareholders meeting.
 
On February 20, 2020, in furtherance of the Company’s desire to sustain and grow the business, the Contract President, Chief Executive Officer and Sole Director of the Company appointed three additional Directors to serve until the annual shareholders meeting.

Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we issued Major League Football, LLC 8,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for assets of Major League Football, LLC primarily comprised of business plans and related proprietary documents, trademarks and other related intellectual property related to the development of the league. Also, our Board of Directors was expanded, a new management team was appointed, and several league consultants were retained by our Company. On November 24, 2014, we changed our name to Major League Football, Inc. from Universal Capital Management, Inc.
