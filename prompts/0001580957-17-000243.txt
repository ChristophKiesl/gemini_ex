Item 1. Business
Company Background
 
MJ Holdings, Inc. was originally incorporated on November 17, 2006, as Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada. Until February 2014, we operated as an EDGAR filing agent, wherein we assisted companies in preparing and filing periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on the EDGAR, (electronic data gathering analysis retrieval) platform. On February 14, 2014, we amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation and changed our business model.
 
All references to “MJ Holdings” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” in this report are to MJ Holdings, Inc.
 
MJ Holdings owned and leased real estate to licensed operators in the regulated cannabis industry. Additionally, we are developing desktop and mobile social, meet-up and health and wellness applications. We have been able to charge rents at a premium to current market rents as certain landlords have been resistant to lease to marijuana operators due to its legal status under federal law.
 
To date, we have financed our real estate acquisitions through the issuance of debt and equity.
 
Divestiture of Our Real Estate Business
 
On November 22, 2016, in connection with a plan to divest ourselves of our real estate business, we submitted to our shareholders an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) our common stock for shares in MJ Real Estate Partners, LLC, (“MJRE”) a newly formed LLC formed for the sole purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer. Subsequent to the completion of the Exchange Offer, which closed on January 10, 2017, MJRE will serve as a holding company for the real estate assets and business previously owned by MJ Holdings. Shareholders who participated in the Exchange Offer received one MJRE common unit for each share of MJ Holdings common stock accepted in the Exchange Offer.
 On January 10, 2017, the Company accepted for exchange 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,800,000 shares of MJRE’s common units, representing membership interests in MJRE. Effective February 1, 2017, the Company transferred its ownership interests in the real estate properties and its subsidiaries, through which the Company holds ownership of the real estate properties, to MJRE. MJRE also assumed the senior notes and any and all obligations associated with the real estate properties and business, effective February 1, 2017.
 
The MJ Real Estate Partners separation is due to our inability to scale and expand our real estate business as previously planned and our intention to engage in business opportunities where we believe we have greater growth opportunities to which capital will be more readily available.

Our Digital Assets
 
We operate and are developing mobile and computer based applications focused on providing cannabis for medical use content and educational materials to licensed medical professionals, in addition to matching patients with medical professionals who are familiar with the therapeutic effects and indications of cannabinoids and making social connections by and between cannabis users.
 
Our goal is to:
 

• | create a general awareness of the use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide educational materials to medical professionals related to the indication of cannabis as a therapeutic option for patients, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide meaningful information to persons who suffer from medical conditions of the possibility that cannabis products may be used with positive effect, and; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | easily match medical doctors and patients together in a efficient and seamless way, and thereby creating a better healthcare experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue
 
We have not generated any revenue from our digital assets and do not anticipate generating revenues in the next six to nine months. Our goal is to develop a “freemium” based business model, where we offer our services for free in an effort to build and develop a user-base. We expect to generate revenues in the future through advertising and by marketing premium products and services to our growing user-base.
 
Sales and marketing
 
We expect to attract the majority of our users through word-of-mouth, search engine, social media and other free channels. We believe that by aggregating compelling content we can generate traffic to our websites. We further believe that if we are successful in recruiting medical professionals as advisors who will promote the use of cannabis for medical use, we can build public awareness and drive engagement.
 
Competition
 
The medical information and content industry is extremely competitive. We compete with mainstream companies as well as a number of other companies that are directing their efforts to the cannabis space. In addition to other online brands, we compete indirectly with offline services, such as in-person caregivers in addition to internet forums and social media platforms.
 
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
 

• | our ability to increase create compelling content;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to build trust of our content among medical professionals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the breadth and depth of our content relative to those of our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to build a user-base of medical professionals, together with our ability to build a user-base of users seeking to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to continue to monetization our content, products and services; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ease of use of our products and design and functionality of our products.
