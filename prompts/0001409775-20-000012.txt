Item 1. | Business

Overview
The Parent is a financial holding company that conducts its business operations primarily through its commercial banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, which is an Alabama banking corporation headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. The Parent was organized in 2007 as a Texas corporation. In April, BBVA announced that it was moving to unify its brand globally. As part of this re-branding, the Bank will transition away from the use of the BBVA Compass name and be re-branded as BBVA. As part of this re-branding, effective June 10, 2019, the Parent amended its Certificate of Formation to change its legal name from BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc. to BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.
The Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of BBVA (NYSE: BBVA). BBVA is a global financial services group founded in 1857. It has a significant market position in Spain, owns the largest financial institution in Mexico, has franchises in South America, has a banking position in Turkey and operates an extensive global branch network. BBVA acquired the Company in 2007.
The Bank performs banking services customary for full service banks of similar size and character. Such services include receiving demand and time deposits, making personal and commercial loans and furnishing personal and commercial checking accounts. The Bank offers, either directly or through its subsidiaries or affiliates, a variety of services, including: portfolio management and administration and investment services to estates and trusts; term life insurance, variable annuities, property and casualty insurance and other insurance products; investment advisory services; a variety of investment services and products to institutional and individual investors; discount brokerage services, and investment company securities and fixed-rate annuities. 
The Parent also owns BSI, a registered broker-dealer that engages in investment banking and institutional sales of fixed income securities.
Through BBVA Transfer Holdings, Inc., the Company engages in money transfer services and related activities, including money transmission and foreign exchange services. 
As part of its operations, the Company regularly evaluates acquisition and investment opportunities of a type permissible for a financial holding company. The Company may also from time to time consider the potential disposition of certain of its assets, branches, subsidiaries, or lines of business. 
On August 1, 2017, BBVA received notification that the Federal Reserve Board determined that the election by BBVA to become an FHC was effective as of August 1, 2017. This election allows the Company to engage in a broader range of activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These expanded services include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, merchant banking, and insurance company portfolio investment.
Banking Operations
At December 31, 2019, the Company, through the Bank, operated 641 banking offices in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas. The following chart reflects the distribution of branch locations in each of the states in which the Company conducts its banking operations:

Alabama | 89 
Arizona | 63 
California | 61 
Colorado | 37 
Florida | 44 
New Mexico | 17 
Texas | 330
Total | 641

The banking centers in Alabama are located throughout the state. In Arizona, the banking centers are concentrated in the Tucson and Phoenix metropolitan markets. The banking centers in California are concentrated in the Inland Empire and Central Valley regions. The Colorado banking centers are concentrated in the Denver metropolitan area and the New Mexico banking centers are concentrated in the Albuquerque metropolitan area. In Florida, the banking centers are concentrated in Jacksonville, Gainesville, and the Florida panhandle. The Texas banking centers are primarily located in the state’s four largest metropolitan areas of Houston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, San Antonio, and Austin, as well as cities in south Texas, such as McAllen and Laredo. 
The Company also operates loan production offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Orlando, West Palm Beach, Sarasota, and Tampa, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Fresno, Irvine, Los Angeles, Oakland, Ontario, Sacramento, San Diego and San Jose, California; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina.
Economic Conditions
The Company's operations and customers are primarily concentrated in the Sunbelt region of the United States, particularly in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. In terms of geographic distribution, approximately 53% of the Company’s total deposits and 51% of its branches are located in Texas, while Alabama represents approximately 22% of the Company’s total deposits. While the Company's ability to conduct business and the demand for the Company's products is impacted by the overall health of the United States economy, local economic conditions in the Sunbelt region, and specifically in the states in which the Company conducts business, also significantly affect demand for the Company's products, the ability of borrowers to repay loans and the value of collateral securing loans. 
One key indicator of economic health is the unemployment rate. During 2019, the U.S. unemployment rate improved slightly from 3.9% for December 2018 to 3.5% in December 2019. The following table provides a comparison of unemployment rates as of December 2019 and 2018 for the states in which the Company has a retail branch presence. 

 | Unemployment Rate*
State | December 2019 | December 2018 | Change
Alabama | 2.7% | 3.8% | (1.1) 
Arizona | 4.6% | 4.9% | (0.3) 
California | 3.9% | 4.1% | (0.2) 
Colorado | 2.5% | 3.6% | (1.1) 
Florida | 3.0% | 3.3% | (0.3) 
New Mexico | 4.7% | 5.0% | (0.3) 
Texas | 3.5% | 3.7% | (0.2) 

* Source: United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics as of December 2019
A key driver of the improvement in the unemployment rate has been continued strength in nonfarm payroll growth. The following table provides a comparison of nonfarm payroll at December 2019 to December 2018.

 | Nonfarm Payroll*
 | December 2019 | December 2018 | Change
State | (In Thousands) 
Alabama | 2,112.9 | 2,066.6 | 46.3 
Arizona | 3,019.0 | 2,934.6 | 84.4 
California | 17,761.1 | 17,449.8 | 311.3 
Colorado | 2,821.5 | 2,765.8 | 55.7 
Florida | 9,204.0 | 8,989.9 | 214.1 
New Mexico | 866.3 | 851.5 | 14.8 
Texas | 13,055.2 | 12,711.0 | 344.2

Combined, the seven-state Sunbelt region in which the Company operates accounted for approximately 50% of the total increase in nonfarm payroll in the U.S. in 2019. The largest year-over-year increases nationally occurred in California, Florida and Texas, with Texas accounting for 16% of the total increase in total nonfarm payroll in 2019. 
Another economic indicator of health is the real estate market, and in particular changes in residential home prices. After 2008, the national real estate market experienced a significant decline in value, and the value of real estate in certain Southeastern and Southwestern states in particular declined significantly more than real estate values in the United States as a whole. Recent data suggests that the housing market throughout the United States continues to strengthen and home prices have recaptured most of the value lost during the economic downturn. The following table presents changes in home prices since the end of 2007 and changes in home prices during 2019 for the states in which the Company operates. During 2019 home prices increased equal to or higher than the national average in all of the states in which the Company operates a retail branch network except California and Colorado. Additionally, home prices were above 2007 levels in all states. 

 | Percentage Change in | Percentage Change in 
State | Home Prices since 2007* | Home Prices during 2019*
Alabama | 12.2% | 5.0% 
Arizona | 7.9% | 4.7% 
California | 18.4% | 2.6% 
Colorado | 66.2% | 3.7% 
Florida | 9.4% | 4.6% 
New Mexico | 4.6% | 5.2% 
Texas | 57.6% | 4.3% 
U.S. National Average | 20.3% | 4.0%

Segment Information
The Company is organized along lines of business. Each line of business is a strategic unit that serves a particular group of customers with certain common characteristics by offering various products and services. The lines of business results include certain overhead allocations and intercompany transactions. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s operating segments consisted of Commercial Banking and Wealth, Retail Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Treasury. 
The Commercial Banking and Wealth segment serves the Company’s commercial customers through its wide array of banking and investment services to businesses in the Company’s markets. The segment also provides private banking and wealth management services to high net worth individuals, including specialized investment portfolio management, traditional credit products, traditional trust and estate services, investment advisory services, financial counseling and customized services to companies and their employees. The Commercial Banking and Wealth segment also supports its commercial customers with capabilities in treasury management, accounts receivable purchasing, asset-based lending, international services, as well as insurance and interest rate protection and investment products. The Commercial Banking and Wealth segment is also responsible for the Company's small business customers and indirect automobile portfolio.
The Retail Banking segment serves the Company’s consumer customers through its full-service banking centers, private client offices throughout the U.S., and alternative delivery channels such as internet, mobile, ATMs and telephone banking. The Retail Banking segment provides individuals with comprehensive products and services including home mortgages, consumer loans, credit and debit cards, and deposit accounts. 
The Corporate and Investment Banking segment is responsible for providing a wide array of banking and investment services to corporate and institutional clients. In addition to traditional credit and deposit products, the Corporate and Investment Banking segment also supports its customers with capabilities in treasury management, accounts receivable purchasing, asset-based lending, foreign-exchange and international services, and interest rate protection and investment products.
11

The Treasury segment’s primary function is to manage the liquidity and funding position of the Company, the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's balance sheet and the investment securities portfolio.
For financial information regarding the Company’s segments, which are presented by line of business, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, see Note 21, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
In most of the markets served by the Company, it encounters intense competition from national, regional and local financial service providers, including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers and finance companies. Competition is based on a number of factors, including customer service and convenience, the quality and range of products and services offered, innovation, price, reputation and interest rates on loans and deposits. The Company’s ability to compete effectively also depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate employees while managing employee-related costs. 
Many of the Company’s nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery channels, consolidation among financial service providers, bank failures and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies. For a discussion of risks related to the competition the Company faces, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors.

Employees
At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 10,560 full-time equivalent employees. 
Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors 
The Company and the Bank are regulated extensively under federal and state law. In addition, certain of the Company's non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under federal and state law. The following discussion sets forth some of the elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers, including depositors as well as the DIF, and not for the protection of security holders and creditors. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.
General
The Parent is registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act and based upon the Parent's election to become a financial holding company, has the additional powers 
12

of a financial holding company. Bank holding companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, the Alabama Banking Department regulates holding companies, like the Parent, that own Alabama-chartered banks, like the Bank, under the bank holding company laws of the State of Alabama. The Company is subject to primary regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, through the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and by the Alabama Banking Department. The Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank’s deposits as permitted by law. Numerous other federal and state laws, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Alabama Banking Department, govern almost all aspects of the operations of the Company and the Bank. The Company and the Bank are also subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise the Company's non-bank subsidiaries including its brokerage, investment advisory, insurance agency, money transfer, and processing operations. These include, but are not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, federal and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance, money transfer and brokerage activities. 
The legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework governing the financial services sector has significantly changed since the financial crisis, as well as in response to other factors, such as technological and market changes. Moreover, the intensity of supervisory and regulatory scrutiny and regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.
In May 2018 the United States Congress passed, and President Trump signed into law, the EGRRCPA. Among other regulatory changes, the EGRRCPA amends various sections of the Dodd-Frank Act, including section 165, which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies. The EGRRCPA’s increased asset thresholds took effect immediately for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets less than $100 billion, with the exception of risk committee requirements, which now apply to publicly-traded bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets. Bank holding companies with consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion were subject to the enhanced prudential standards that applied to them before enactment of EGRRCPA until December 31, 2019, when the Tailoring Rules became effective, as described in detail below. 
In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued the Tailoring Rules, which adjust the thresholds at which certain enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements apply to FBOs, including BBVA, and the U.S. IHCs of FBOs, including the Company, pursuant to the EGRRCPA. These rules establish risk-based categories for FBOs and their U.S. IHCs that determine whether and to what extent enhanced prudential standards and certain capital and liquidity requirements apply to FBOs and their U.S. IHCs. BBVA is classified as a Category IV FBO as it has $100 billion in combined U.S. assets and the Company is not classified in any of the categories because it has less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. 
As a result, BBVA and the Company are now generally subject to less restrictive enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements than under previously applicable regulations, as described in more detail in the relevant sections below. If in the future the Company has an average of $100 billion or more of total consolidated assets over the preceding four calendar quarters, it will become a Category IV U.S. IHC under the Tailoring Rules and certain enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements will again apply to the Company and the Bank following any applicable phase-in or transition periods. The Company is currently evaluating what effect these final rules will have on the Company, its subsidiaries, or these entities’ activities, financial condition and/or results of operations.
Permitted Activities
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than five percent of the voting shares of, any company engaged in the following activities:

• | banking or managing or controlling banks;


• | furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries; and


• | engaging in activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including:


• | factoring accounts receivable;

13


• | making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities;


• | leasing personal or real property;


• | operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association;


• | performing trust company functions;


• | providing financial and investment advisory activities;


• | conducting discount securities brokerage activities;


• | underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments;


• | providing specified management consulting and counseling activities;


• | performing selected data processing services and support services;


• | acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions;


• | performing selected insurance underwriting activities;


• | providing certain community development activities (such as making investments in projects designed primarily to promote community welfare); and


• | issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments.

As a financial holding company, the Parent is permitted to engage in, and be affiliated with companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than those permitted for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. In addition to the activities described above, financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Company and the Bank must each remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order for the Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding company. In addition, the Bank must maintain a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory” for the Company to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies.
The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the financial holding company's continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Actions by Federal and State Regulators
Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve Board, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on the Company's part if they determine that it has insufficient capital or other resources, or is otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, the Company's bank regulators can require it to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consents or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls; information systems and audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; and asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking regulators have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines 
14

prescribing standards for safety and soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
Dividends
The Parent’s ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by federal banking law and Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless a bank holding company’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, and the primary sources of funds for the Parent's interest and principal payments on its debt are cash on hand and dividends from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and its non-banking subsidiaries may pay. Under Alabama law, the Bank may not pay a dividend in excess of 90 percent of its net earnings until its surplus is equal to at least 20 percent of capital. The Bank is also required by Alabama law to seek the approval of the Alabama Superintendent of Banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (a) the Bank's net earnings for that year, plus (b) its retained net earnings for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal, state and local taxes. The Bank cannot, without approval from the Federal Reserve Board and the Alabama Superintendent of Banking, declare or pay a dividend to the Parent unless the Bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above.
The FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. In addition, federal banking regulations applicable to the Company and its bank subsidiary require minimum levels of capital that limit the amounts available for payment of dividends. In addition, many regulators have a policy, but not a requirement, that a dividend payment should not exceed net income to date in the current year. The ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends and make other capital distribution also depends on their ability to maintain a sufficient capital conservation buffer under the U.S. Basel III capital framework. 
The Parent's ability to pay dividends has also been subject to the Federal Reserve Board's review of the Company's periodic capital plan and supervisory stress tests of the Company conducted by the Federal Reserve Board as a part of its periodic CCAR process. As a result of the EGRRCPA and Tailoring Rules, however, the Company is no longer subject to CCAR or the Federal Reserve Board’s stress testing requirements, unless and until the Company becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC. 
Enhanced Prudential Standards 
Pursuant to Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act, certain bank holding companies are subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements. As a result, the Company has been subject to more stringent standards, including liquidity and capital requirements, leverage limits, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management standards, than those applicable to smaller institutions. Certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards.
As discussed above, under the EGRRCPA and Tailoring Rules, the Company is now exempt from many enhanced prudential standards, with the exception of risk committee requirements and any requirements applicable to BBVA and its combined U.S. operations that affect the Company, including certain liquidity and risk management requirements. Under the Tailoring Rules, however, certain enhanced prudential standards would once again apply to the Company if it becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC under the Tailoring Rules. 
15

Under the enhanced prudential standard applicable to Large FBOs, BBVA designated the Parent as its IHC. BBVA’s combined U.S. operations (including its U.S. branches, agencies and subsidiaries) are also subject to liquidity, risk management, stress testing, asset maintenance and other enhanced prudential standards, as modified by the Tailoring Rules.
Certain requirements of these enhanced prudential standards that are applicable to the Company and the combined U.S. operations of BBVA are discussed under the relevant topic areas below.
Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rule. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications. 
Under the U.S. Basel III final rule, the Company’s and the Bank’s assets, exposures, and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for the Company and the Bank:

• | CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, represents the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, and accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the U.S. Basel III final rule, the Company made a one-time election to filter certain accumulated other comprehensive income components, with the result that those components are not recognized in the Company’s CET1. In July 2019, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC issued final rules that simplify the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that an institution could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as simplify the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank as they have less then $250 billion in total assets. Banking organizations may adopt these changes beginning on January 1, 2020. In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of CECL on retained earnings over a period of three years. 


• | Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, represents the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock, and certain qualifying capital instruments. 


• | Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, represents the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also includes, among other things, certain trust preferred securities. 


• | Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, represents the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain other deductions).

The U.S. Basel III final rule also requires banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in over a three-year period that began on January 1, 2016. The phase-in period ended on January 1, 2019, and the capital conservation buffer was at its fully phased-in level of 2.5% throughout 2019. 
The total minimum regulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below. The Federal Reserve Board has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III final rule. For purposes of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
16

Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater. If the Federal Reserve Board were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2019, would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve Board may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile, and growth plans.
Capital Ratios as of December 31, 2019
The table below shows certain regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2019 using the Transitional Basel III regulatory capital methodology applicable to the Company during 2019.

Table 2 Capital Ratios 
-------------------------------
 | Regulatory Minimum for Company and Bank (1) | | Minimum Ratio + Capital Conservation Buffer (2) | | Well-Capitalized Minimum for the Bank | The Company | | The Bank
CET 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 4.5 | % | | 7.0 | % | 6.5 | % | | 12.49 | % | 11.56 | %
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 6.0 | % | | 8.5 | % | 8.0 | % | | 12.83 | % | 11.56 | %
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 8.0 | % | | 10.5 | % | 10.0 | % | | 14.98 | % | 13.94 | %
Leverage Ratio | 4.0 | % | | N/A | | 5.0 | % | | 9.70 | % | 8.98 | %

(1) Regulatory minimum requirements do not include the capital conservation buffer, which must be maintained in addition to meeting regulatory minimum requirements in order to avoid automatic restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments.
(2) Reflects the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% applicable during 2019.
See Note 16, Regulatory Capital Requirements and Dividends from Subsidiaries, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the calculation of capital ratios for the Company and the Bank. 
Prompt Corrective Action for Undercapitalization
The FDICIA established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of five capital categories as described below. The federal banking regulators are also required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend upon the capital category to which the insured depository institution is assigned. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDICIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking regulators have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. Under the prompt corrective action regulations that are currently in effect under the U.S. Basel III framework, all insured depository institutions are assigned to one of the following capital categories:
Well-capitalized - The insured depository institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well-capitalized insured depository institution is one (1) having a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10 percent or greater, (2) having a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8 percent or greater, (3) having a CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.5 percent or greater (4) having a Leverage Ratio of 5 percent or greater, and (5) that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
Adequately Capitalized - The insured depository institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. An adequately capitalized insured depository institution is one (1) having a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8 percent or greater, (2) having a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6 percent or greater, and (3) having a CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 4.5 percent 
17

or greater (4) having a Leverage Ratio of 4 percent or greater, and (5) failing to meet the definition of a well-capitalized bank.
Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized insured depository institution is one (1) having a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 8 percent, (2) having a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6 percent, (3) having a CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or (4) a Leverage Ratio of less than 4 percent.
Significantly Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized insured depository institution is one (1) having a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6 percent, (2) having a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4 percent, (3) a CET 1 Risk Based-Capital Ratio of less than 3 percent, or (4) a Leverage Ratio of less than 3 percent.
Critically Undercapitalized - The insured depository institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 percent.
The regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to downgrade an institution to the next lower category if the regulator determines after notice and opportunity for hearing or response that the institution (1) is in an unsafe or unsound condition or (2) has received and not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination. Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend upon an institution's classification within the five categories. The Company's management believes that the Company and the Bank have the requisite capital levels to qualify as well-capitalized institutions under the FDICIA. See Note 16, Regulatory Capital Requirements and Dividends from Subsidiaries, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
If an institution fails to remain well-capitalized, it will be subject to a variety of enforcement remedies that increase as the capital condition worsens. For instance, the FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized as a result. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking regulators may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capital and Long-Term Debt Requirements
The Federal Reserve Board's final rule on the total loss-absorbing capacity of U.S. G-SIBs and the U.S. intermediate holding companies of non-U.S. G-SIBs does not apply to the Company since neither the Parent nor BBVA are G-SIBs.
Single Counterparty Credit Limits
In June 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule implementing single counterparty credit limits applicable to the combined U.S. operations of major FBOs and to certain large U.S. IHCs of FBOs. The rule imposes percentage limitations on a firm’s net credit exposures to individual counterparties (aggregated based on affiliation), generally as a percentage of the firm’s tier 1 capital. As a result of the Tailoring Rules, the Company will not be subject to the single 
18

counterparty credit limits rule unless and until it becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC. BBVA will be subject to single counterparty credit limits with respect to its combined U.S. operations starting in July 2020. However, under the Tailoring Rules, BBVA may elect to comply with home-country single counterparty credit limits instead of the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, and BBVA expects to make this election. If BBVA were to elect to comply with the Federal Reserve Board’s rule or if the Company were to become a Category IV U.S. IHC, the Federal Reserve Board’s single counterparty credit limits could adversely affect the Company’s financial position.
Periodic Capital Plans and Stress Testing
The Company has been required to submit periodic capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board and generally could pay dividends and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board had not objected as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s annual CCAR process. In addition to capital planning requirements the Company and the Bank have been subject to stress testing requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s enhanced prudential standards and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company has been required to conduct periodic company-run stress tests and has been subject to periodic supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board.
On February 5, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board announced that certain less-complex U.S. bank holding companies and U.S. IHCs with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Company, would not be subject to supervisory stress testing, company-run stress testing or the CCAR process for the 2019 capital plan and stress test cycle. 
As a result of the Tailoring Rules, the Company and the Bank are no longer required to participate in the CCAR process and are no longer subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s stress testing requirements unless and until the Company becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC. 
The Company remains subject to the requirement to develop and maintain a capital plan, and the board of directors (or designated subcommittee thereof) remain subject to the requirements to review and approve the capital plan.
Proposed Stress Buffer Requirements
On April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal to integrate its capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The proposal, which would apply to the consolidated operations of U.S. IHCs would introduce a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer, or stress buffer requirements, and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes.
For risk-based capital requirements, the stress capital buffer would replace the existing Capital Conservation Buffer, which is now 2.5%. The stress capital buffer would equal the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period, plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected risk-weighted assets for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period, and (ii) 2.5%. 
Like the stress capital buffer, the stress leverage buffer would be calculated based on the results of our most recent supervisory stress tests. The stress leverage buffer would equal the maximum decline in our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio under the severely adverse scenario, plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected leverage ratio denominator for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period. No floor would be established for the stress leverage buffer, which would apply in addition to the current minimum Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 4%. 
The proposal would make related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for the consolidated operations of U.S. IHCs subject to the stress buffer requirements. In particular, the proposal would limit projected capital actions to planned common stock dividends in the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period and would assume that the consolidated operations of IHCs maintain a constant level of assets and risk-weighted assets throughout the supervisory stress test projection period. 
The Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chairman for Supervision stated that the Federal Reserve Board hopes to finalize the proposed stress buffer requirements for the 2020 stress testing cycle, and that, while the Federal Reserve Board 
19

expects to finalize certain elements of those requirements as proposed, other elements of the proposal will be re-proposed and again subject to public comment.
As a result of the Tailoring Rules, the Company would not be subject to the stress buffer requirements as currently proposed, unless and until the Company becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC.
Deposit Insurance and Assessments
Deposits at the Bank are insured by the DIF as administered by the FDIC, up to the applicable limits established by law. The DIF is funded through assessments on banks, such as the Bank. Changes in the methodology used to calculate these assessments, resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act increased the assessments that the Bank is required to pay to the FDIC. In addition, in March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a surcharge on the assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, to raise the DIF's reserve ratio. These surcharges are no longer applicable effective October 1, 2018 as a result of the FDIC's reserve ratio exceeding 1.35%. The FDIC also collects Financing Corporation deposit assessments, which are calculated off of the assessment base established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank pays the DIF assessment as well as the Financing Corporation assessments.
With respect to brokered deposits, an insured depository institution must be well-capitalized in order to accept, renew or roll over such deposits without FDIC clearance. An adequately capitalized insured depository institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. Undercapitalized insured depository institutions generally may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. See the Deposits section in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Volcker Rule 
The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, and its affiliates from (1) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (2) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (covered funds) subject to certain limited exceptions. The final rules contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained.  They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions.  The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. 
As of October 2019, the five regulatory agencies charged with implementing the Volcker Rule finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule. These amendments tailor the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide the federal agencies. 
In early 2020, the five federal agencies proposed additional amendments to the Volcker Rule related to the restrictions on ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds. The Company is of the view that the impact of the Volcker Rule, including the recent and proposed amendments to the Volcker Rule, is not material to its business operations.
Durbin Amendment's Rules Affecting Debit Card Interchange Fees 
Under the Durbin Amendment the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction, a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment, and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. 
Consumer Protection Regulations
Retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers, and the Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z issued by the CFPB, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

20


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C issued by the CFPB, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B issued by the CFPB, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of various prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V issued by the CFPB, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F issued by the CFPB, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;


• | the Service Members Civil Relief Act, applying to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including credit card and other open-end debt) and limiting the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability; and


• | the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.

Deposit operations also are subject to, among others:

• | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD issued by the CFPB, which require disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;


• | Regulation CC issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and


• | the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the CFPB, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

In addition, there are consumer protection standards that apply to functional areas of operation (rather than applying only to loan or deposit products). The Company and the Bank are also subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations.
The CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related rules since it was established under the Dodd-Frank Act including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. 
Changes to consumer protection regulations, including those promulgated by the CFPB could affect the Company's business but the likelihood, timing and scope of any such changes and the impact any such change may have on the Company cannot be determined with any certainty. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company is also subject to legislation and regulation and future legislation or regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation could affect its business.
Resolution Plans for the Company and the Bank
BBVA is required to prepare and submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, also referred to as a living will, which, in the event of material financial distress or failure, provides for the rapid and orderly liquidation of BBVA’s material U.S. operations under the bankruptcy code and in a way that would not pose systemic risk to the financial system of the United States. If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly determine that 
21

BBVA’s plan is not credible and BBVA fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC may jointly impose on BBVA, or on any of its subsidiaries, including the Company, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. The Bank must also submit to the FDIC a separate plan whereby the institution can be resolved by the FDIC, in the event of failure, in a manner that ensures depositors will receive access to insured funds within the required timeframes and generally ensures an orderly liquidation of the institution.
BBVA filed its most recent resolution plan on December 20, 2018, and the Bank filed its most recent plan on June 29, 2018. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued a final rule that reduces or eliminates resolution planning requirements for institutions that fall into certain risk-based categories. As a result, BBVA will be required to submit a more streamlined resolution plan once every three years, with its next submission due in July 2022. In April 2019, the FDIC released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the FDIC’s bank resolution plan requirements that requested comments on how to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size, complexity, and risk profile. Until the FDIC’s revisions to its bank resolution plan requirement are finalized, no bank resolution plans will be required to be filed.
U.S. Liquidity Standards
The Federal Reserve Board evaluates the Company’s liquidity as part of the supervisory process. The Company has also been subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s LCR requirements, but as a result of the Tailoring Rules, the Company is no longer subject to the LCR and would not be subject to the proposed NSFR requirements unless and until the Company becomes a Category IV U.S. IHC.
Anti-Money Laundering; USA PATRIOT Act; Office of Foreign Assets Control
A major focus of U.S. governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for that financial institution. 
Under laws applicable to the Company, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and implementing regulations, U.S. financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; testing of the program by an independent audit function and risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
The Company is prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships. The Company also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships, as appropriate, to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act, law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by banks, and anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened. 
The USA PATRIOT Act amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides for, among other things, the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. The statute also provides for: (1) regulations that set minimum requirements for verifying customer identification at account opening; (2) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; and (3) enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. 
Federal, state, and local law enforcement may, through FinCEN, request that the Bank search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons reasonably suspected to be involved in terrorist activity or money laundering. Upon receiving such a request, the Bank must search its records and timely report to FinCEN any identified relationships or transactions. 
Furthermore, OFAC is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, 
22

lists of names, such as the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, of individuals and entities with whom U.S. persons, as defined by OFAC, are generally prohibited from conducting transactions or dealings. Persons on these lists include persons suspected of aiding, financing, or engaging in terrorist acts, narcotics trafficking, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, among other targeted activities. OFAC also administers sanctions programs against certain countries or territories. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer instruction that is on an OFAC list or determines that processing a transaction or maintaining or servicing an account would violate a sanctions program administered by OFAC, it must, depending on the regulation, freeze such account, reject such transaction, file a suspicious activity report and/or notify the appropriate authorities.
Commitments to the Bank
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, both BBVA and the Parent are required to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances when BBVA and the Parent might not do so absent the statutory requirement. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary, other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank, upon the Federal Reserve Board's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary. Further, the Federal Reserve Board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution's financial condition. In addition, any loans by the Parent to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
A variety of legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with the Company or the Company's non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board's Regulation W. Section 23A places limits on the amount of “covered transactions,” which include loans or extensions of credit to, investments in or certain other transactions with, affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10 percent of a bank's capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20 percent for all affiliates. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100 to 130 percent. Also, a bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from any of its affiliates. Section 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadens the definition of “covered transactions” to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party. Furthermore, reverse repurchase transactions are viewed as extensions of credit (instead of asset purchases) and thus become subject to collateral requirements. 
Section 23B prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound, Regulation W generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates. Transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits. The Federal Reserve Board also may designate bank subsidiaries as affiliates.
Banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit (1) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (2) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (3) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank's board of directors.
Regulatory Examinations
Federal and state banking agencies require the Company and the Bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. The Bank, and in some cases the Company and the Company's non-bank affiliates, must undergo regular on-site examinations by 
23

the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires the Federal Reserve Board to evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations on the Bank and the Company. In addition, the Bank must maintain a CRA rating of at least "Satisfactory" for the Company to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies. Leaders of some federal banking agencies recently have indicated their support for revising the CRA regulatory framework, and in December 2019, the OCC and FDIC issued a joint proposed rule that would amend the CRA regulatory framework. It is too early to tell whether and to what extent any changes will be made to applicable CRA requirements.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. The regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations. Such loans generally include land development, construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property, and nonfarm, nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:

• | total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100 percent or more of the institution's total capital, or


• | total commercial real estate loans represent 300 percent or more of the institution's total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months.

In October 2009, the federal banking regulators issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may impact the Company's business by reducing the amount of its commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets. Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. In October 2014, the banking agencies issued final rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of Dodd-Frank. The regulations became effective on February 23, 2015. Compliance with the rules with respect to new securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages have been required since December 24, 2015 and compliance with respect to new securitization transactions backed by other types of assets have been required since December 24, 2016. 
Anti-Tying Restrictions
In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (1) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to said bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries, or (2) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. Also, certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule.
24

Privacy and Credit Reporting
The Federal Reserve Board, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity through guidance, examinations and regulations. 
The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires disclosures to consumers regarding policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s policies and procedures. 
States are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The Company continues to assess the requirements of such laws and proposed legislation and their applicability to the Company. Moreover, these laws, and proposed legislation, are still subject to revision or formal guidance and they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s understanding.
The Bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Federal Reserve Regulation V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act.
Cybersecurity
In October 2016, the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including the Company and the Bank. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.
Enforcement Powers
The Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including management, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution's affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. Violations can include failure to timely file required reports, filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. Regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties, and the FDIC has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease-and-desist and similar orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking regulators also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution (and bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless.
Monetary Policy and Economic Controls
The Bank's earnings, and therefore the Company's earnings, are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to 
25

promote orderly economic growth by influencing interest rates and the supply of money and credit. Among the methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings, expanded access to funds for non-banks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, interest rates on loans and securities, and rates paid for deposits. 
The effects of the various Federal Reserve Board policies on the Company's future business and earnings cannot be predicted. The Company cannot predict the nature or extent of any affects that possible future governmental controls or legislation might have on its business and earnings.
Depositor Preference Statute
Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by any receiver.
FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements
In November 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule establishing recordkeeping requirements for FDIC-insured institutions with 2 million or more deposit accounts, which includes the Bank. The rule generally requires each covered institution to maintain complete and accurate information needed to determine deposit insurance coverage with respect to each deposit account. In addition, each covered institution must ensure that its information technology system is able to calculate the insured amount for most depositors within 24 hours of failure. Compliance is required by April 1, 2020.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act
The Company discloses the following information pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to disclose whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with natural persons or entities designated by the U.S. government under specified executive orders, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with local law. In order to comply with this requirement, the Company has requested relevant information from its affiliates globally.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company did not knowingly engage in activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with natural persons or entities designated by the U.S. government under the specified executive orders.
Because the Company is controlled by BBVA, the Company's disclosure includes activities, transactions or dealings conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates of BBVA and its consolidated subsidiaries that are not controlled by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the BBVA Group had the following activities, transactions and dealings requiring disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
Legacy contractual obligations related to counter indemnities. BBVA made a payment of $642 to Bank Melli on July 11, 2019, due to outstanding commissions on the counterindemnity executed on October 16, 2018. Such counterindemnity was issued in April 2000 and has been regularly reported until its execution in 2018.
Iranian embassy-related activity. The BBVA Group maintains bank accounts in Spain for one employee of the Iranian embassy in Spain. This employee is a Spanish citizen. Estimated gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, from embassy-related activity, which include fees and/or commissions, did not exceed $2,225.
