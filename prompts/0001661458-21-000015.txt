Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a self-advised and self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) created to own and manage substantially all of the “non-core” assets previously owned and managed by our former parent, InvenTrust Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation (“InvenTrust”). On April 28, 2016, we were spun-off from InvenTrust through a pro rata distribution (the “Distribution”) by InvenTrust of 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to holders of InvenTrust’s common stock. Prior to or concurrent with the separation, we and InvenTrust engaged in certain reorganization transactions that were designed to consolidate substantially all of InvenTrust’s remaining “non-core” assets in Highlands. Highlands was incorporated in December 2015 as a Maryland corporation and operates in a manner that allows us to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal tax purposes.
This portfolio of “non-core” assets, which were acquired by InvenTrust between 2005 and 2008, included assets that are special use, single-tenant or build-to-suit; face unresolved legal issues; are in undesirable locations or in weak markets or submarkets; are aging or functionally obsolete; and/or have sub-optimal leasing metrics. A number of our assets are retail properties located in tertiary markets, which are particularly susceptible to the negative trends affecting retail real estate, including the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these characteristics, such assets are difficult to lease, finance and refinance and are relatively illiquid compared to other types of real estate assets. These factors also significantly limit our asset disposition options, impact the timing of such dispositions and restrict the viable options available to the Company for a future potential liquidity option.
Our strategy is focused on preserving, protecting and maximizing the total value of our portfolio with the long-term objective of providing stockholders with a return of their investment. We engage in rigorous asset management, and seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio, by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, improving our overall capital structure and making select investments in our existing “non-core” assets to maximize their value. To the extent we are able to generate cash flows from operations or dispositions of assets, in addition to the cash uses outlined above, our board of directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek to reinvest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets, as part of the Company’s overall strategy to optimize the value of the portfolio, enhance our options for a future potential liquidity option and maximize shareholder value. Given the nature and quality of the “non-core” assets in our portfolio as well as current market conditions, a definitive timeline for execution of our strategy cannot be made. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business has disrupted our efforts to implement a liquidity option and, although we cannot predict when circumstances will improve, we will continue to evaluate options to implement a liquidity option during 2022. However, we may be unable to execute on such a transaction on terms we would find attractive for our stockholders and our ability to do so will be influenced by external and macroeconomic factors, including, among others, the effects and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and future resurgences, the timing and nature of recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, government policy changes and competitive factors.
As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of one office asset, two industrial assets, four retail assets, twelve multi-family assets, one correctional facility, and one parcel of unimproved land, which are all located in the United States. We currently have four business segments, consisting of (i) net lease, (ii) retail, (iii) multi-tenant office and (iv) multi-family. Our unimproved land asset is presented in other assets (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding segment reporting). We may have additional or fewer segments in the future to the extent we enter into additional real property sectors, dispose of property sectors, or change the character of assets.
    2020 Highlights
•On March 31, 2020, we sold our bank branch ("Citizens"), for a gross sale price of $1.4 million.
•On April 22, 2020, we acquired The Sterling, a 27-unit multi-family asset located in San Diego, California, for a purchase price of $7.4 million.
•Effective September 15, 2020, the Company appointed Kimberly A. Karas to serve, in addition to her existing roles as our Senior Vice President, Controller and principal accounting officer, as our Treasurer and principal financial officer.
•On November 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) that amends that certain Credit Agreement, dated February 15, 2019 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), by and between the 
Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, The Huntington National Bank, individually and as administrative agent, issuing lender, lead arranger, book manager and syndication agent, and the other lenders thereunder, pursuant to which the Company “right-sized” the Credit Agreement by eliminating the Term Loan (as defined in the Third Amendment) previously available under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Third Amendment, the Company borrowed sufficient funds under the Revolving Credit Loan (as defined in the Third Amendment) to repay all of its obligations under the Term Loan. Additionally, pursuant to the Third Amendment, the lender under the Credit Facility waived the Company’s obligation to comply with certain financial covenants for the period from July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the “Waiver Period”) and restricted the Company from drawing on the Revolving Credit Loan in amounts in excess of $20.0 million until the Company is in compliance with all such covenants. 
•Effective January 22, 2021, the Company's board of directors appointed Robert J. Lange to serve as Chief Operating Officer of the Company. In addition to his duties as General Counsel and Secretary, Mr. Lange’s responsibilities have included and will continue to include a variety of operational functions, including strategic planning, non-core asset management, investor relations, certain human resources roles, as well as oversight of the Company's property and corporate insurance portfolios.
Business Strategy
Our investment objectives are to preserve, protect and maximize the total value of our portfolio. Given the quality and nature of the assets in our legacy “non-core” portfolio, which are generally disjointed, non-institutional grade, relatively illiquid, require substantial time and investment to bring to market and are not positioned to protect capital or deliver an acceptable risk-adjusted return, as well as current market conditions, we expect that this turnaround strategy of the remaining "non-core" portfolio will take multiple years to execute. In order to meet our investment objectives, we intend to continue to engage in rigorous asset management, seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio, by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, improving its overall capital structure and making select investments in our existing “non-core” assets to maximize their value. To the extent we are able to generate cash flows from operations or dispositions of assets, in addition to the cash uses outlined above, our board of directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek to reinvest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets, as part of the Company's overall strategy to optimize the value of the portfolio, enhance our options for a future liquidity option and maximize shareholder value. 
Disposition Policy 
 We evaluate each of our assets on a rigorous and ongoing basis in an effort to optimize and enhance the total value of our portfolio. In furtherance of this strategy, for the foreseeable future, we anticipate disposing of select “non-core” assets that are not generating income or have unfavorable risk-adjusted returns and generally, using the proceeds from such sales to prepare other “non-core” assets for sale or invest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets.
The determination of when a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of all of the relevant factors, including whether such disposition will better position the portfolio for a potential future liquidity event, prevailing and projected economic and market conditions, the cash flow being generated by a particular asset, tax implications of a disposition, investment opportunities for any cash proceeds, debt characteristics of the asset, and whether the value of the asset is anticipated to decline or increase. The timing of any disposition will depend upon then-prevailing economic and market conditions and the factors described above, which could result in differing holding periods among the assets. There can be no assurance that dispositions will occur as planned, on acceptable terms, or within our desired timing.
Financing Strategy
On February 15, 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement which initially provided for a secured revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million and a secured term loan facility of up to $50.0 million with an accordion feature for an additional $100.0 million in potential financing. On November 6, 2020, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, “right-size” the Credit Facility by eliminating the term loan facility previously available under the Credit Agreement. See also Note 8 (Debt) in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
In addition, certain of our existing assets are currently encumbered by debt, and debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, acquisition financing, leasing commissions, general corporate purposes and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness may vary and could be long-term or short-term, 
secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. For additional information regarding our existing debt, including our credit facility, please refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Borrowings,” and Note 8 (Debt) in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of our mortgage debt was recourse to the Company, although we have provided certain customary, non-recourse carve-out guarantees in connection with obtaining mortgage loans on certain of our properties. 
Tenants
    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 2.1% and 26.7%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from a net lease with The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”) on our Hudson correctional facility asset. The lease with GEO on this property expired in January of 2020 and GEO has vacated the facility. This vacancy had a negative impact to our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We expect the asset to remain vacant for years to come.
Conflict of Interest Policy
We maintain policies designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Any transaction between us and any director, officer or 5% stockholder must be approved pursuant to our related party transaction policy. In addition, we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that seeks to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest between our employees, directors and officers and our company. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating or minimizing the influence of such conflicts, and if they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of stockholders.
Certain Other Policies
We intend to engage in future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the requirements applicable to REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to so qualify as a REIT.
We may issue senior securities, purchase and sell investments, offer securities in exchange for property and repurchase or reacquire shares or other securities in the future. To the extent we engage in these activities, we will comply with applicable law.
We do not currently have policies in place with respect to making loans to other persons (other than our conflict of interest policies described above) or investing in securities.
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for the leasing of our assets, buyers for the sale of assets and sellers for the acquisition of assets. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than us. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs for buyers, sellers and tenants that may be suitable for us. We perceive there to be a lower level of competition for certain assets in our portfolio based on, among other things, the characteristics of such assets, the number of willing buyers and the volume of transactions in their respective markets, which may make it challenging for us to sell these assets or attract tenants. Many of our retail tenants face intense competition from online retailers, which impacts demand for our brick-and-mortar retail real estate. A shift to e-commerce sales may adversely impact our retail tenants' sales thus causing those retailers to reduce the number of their retail locations in the future.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had nine full-time employees, not including consultants and part-time workers. Our human capital strategy is focused on talent management. We base our hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement decisions on an objective evaluation of qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity. All of our full-time employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package, including, but not limited to, paid time off, medical dental and vision insurance, disability, life insurance, 401(k) matching, and reasonable work from home flexibility. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. To that end, we conduct annual training to raise awareness of, and prevent, harassment and discrimination. Due to the nature of our portfolio and our business strategy, we rely on consultants, professional firms and third parties, under our supervision, to perform many routine operations for us.
Environmental & Other Government Regulation
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our assets.
Compliance with existing environmental and other laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have a material effect in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on assets in which we hold an interest, or on assets that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Insurance
We have insurance coverage for our properties which includes the type of coverage and limits we believe to be appropriate for each property and our business operations. Such coverage typically includes commercial general liability and property insurance which, includes property damage and loss of rental income resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood and extended coverage. Our management believes our insurance coverage contains policy terms and conditions and insured limits that are customary for similar properties and operations.
