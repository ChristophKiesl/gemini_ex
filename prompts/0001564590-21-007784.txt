ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 Sunesis is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel targeted inhibitors for the treatment of hematologic and solid cancers. Sunesis is developing SNS-510, a PDK1 inhibitor licensed from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Takeda Oncology”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. SNS-510 interaction with PDK1 inhibits both PI3K-dependent and independent signaling pathways integral to many malignancies, and PDK1 can also be overexpressed in breast, lung, prostate, hematologic and other cancers. Evaluation of SNS-510 in the Eurofins Oncopanel™, a panel of >300 genomically profiled cancer cell lines from diverse tissue origins, indicated that tumors with mutations or deletions of the Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (“CDKN2A”) gene are particularly sensitive to SNS-510. CDKN2A alterations are common in human cancers and may prove to be useful biomarkers for broad investigation of SNS-510 as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents. In other in vitro studies, SNS-510 had strong activity against a broad range of sarcoma cell lines. SNS-510 showed synergistic activity when combined with inhibitors of CDK4/6, KRAS G12C, or BCL-2 in breast cancer, sarcoma, KRAS-mutant, and lymphoma cell lines. In in vivo studies, SNS-510 demonstrated potent, pathway-mediated antitumor activity in FLT3-mutated and wild-type AML xenograft mouse models, as well as in a myc-activated, CDKN2A-deleted lymphoma xenograft mouse model. Sunesis is completing reporting of Investigational New Drug-enabling studies for SNS-510 and is evaluating the next steps for the program.
 
Sunesis’s second program is vecabrutinib, a selective non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (“BTK”) with activity against both wild-type and C481S-mutated BTK, the most common mutation associated with resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors. In June 2020, Sunesis announced that it will not advance its non-covalent BTK inhibitor vecabrutinib in the planned Phase 2 portion of 
 4


the Phase 1b/2 trial for adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) and other B-cell malignancies. The decision was made after assessing the totality of the data including the 500 mg cohort, the highest dose studied in the trial, as Sunesis found insufficient evidence of activity in BTK-inhibitor resistant disease to move the program into Phase 2. Sunesis has completed the Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1b/2 trial and is evaluating the best path forward for vecabrutinib.
 
Sunesis also has two partnered programs: DAY101 (formerly TAK-580) and vosaroxin. Sunesis has a license agreement with DOT Therapeutics-1 (“DOT-1”) where Sunesis is eligible to receive potential pre-commercialization, event-based milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of DAY101, when and if approved and commercialized. In addition, Sunesis has a license agreement with Denovo Biopharma where Sunesis is eligible to receive potential regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties on future sales of vosaroxin, when and if approved and commercialized.
 
To conserve its cash resources, Sunesis has substantially reduced its workforce and has reduced its research and development activities. In July 2020, Sunesis reduced its workforce by 30% to focus on development of its PDK1 inhibitor SNS-510 while evaluating its strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including asset in-licensing, partnering, and mergers and acquisitions. Sunesis recognized one-time employee severance expenses of $0.2 million related to the reduction in workforce in the third quarter of 2020.
 The Sunesis Board commenced a process of evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. To assist with this process, the Sunesis Board engaged MTS Health Partners, L.P. to help explore Sunesis’s available strategic alternatives, including possible mergers and business combinations, a sale of part or all of Sunesis’s assets, and collaboration and licensing arrangements. On November 30, 2020, Sunesis and Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Viracta”) announced the signing of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated November 29, 2020, as may be amended from time to time (the “Merger Agreement”). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, including approval of the transaction by Sunesis’s stockholders, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunesis will be merged with and into Viracta, with Viracta surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunesis (the “Merger”). 
 On December 18, 2020, due to the entry into the Merger Agreement, Sunesis reduced its workforce by approximately 40% to preserve cash resources while completing the proposed Merger. As a result of the workforce reduction, Sunesis recognized one-time employee severance expenses of $1.3 million, which were included in accrued compensation on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and noncash stock compensation expenses related to accelerated vesting of certain employee stock options of $0.1 million, both of which were recorded as operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Although Sunesis has entered into the Merger Agreement and intends to consummate the Merger, there is no assurance that it will be able to successfully consummate the proposed Merger on a timely basis, or at all. If, for any reason, the Merger is not completed, Sunesis will reconsider its strategic alternatives and could pursue one or more of the following courses of action to reduce its current expenditures:
 
 
• | Pursue potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for Sunesis’s assets, including a sale or other divestiture of its assets. Sunesis may elect to seek potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for its programs, including a sale or other divestiture of its assets which could allow Sunesis’s technology to continue being developed. Sunesis may be unable to divest its assets in a timely manner, or at all, and therefore may not receive any return on Sunesis’s investment in its program assets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue another strategic transaction like the proposed Merger. The Sunesis Board may elect to pursue an alternative strategy, one of which may be a strategic transaction similar to the Merger.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dissolve and liquidate Sunesis’s assets. If, for any reason, the Merger is not consummated and Sunesis is unable to identify and complete an alternative strategic transaction like the Merger or potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for its assets, or to continue to operate its business due to its inability to raise additional funding, it may be required to dissolve and liquidate its assets. In such case, Sunesis would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to its stockholders after paying Sunesis’s debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.

Development Pipeline 
 The following chart summarizes our development pipeline and partnered programs: 
 
SNS-510 
 SNS-510 is a selective inhibitor of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (“PDK1”) that was discovered under a research collaboration agreement between Biogen and Sunesis and in-licensed from Takeda Oncology in 2014, as described below. PDK1 is a master kinase that mediates PI3K/AKT(PKB) signaling through its plekstrin homology (PH) domain, and also regulates other pathways through its PDK1-interacting fragment (“PIF”) pocket. The PI-independent kinases modulated by PDK1 include SGK, PKC, IKK and RSK (S6K) that are critical for growth factor signal transduction. These pathways are involved in cell growth, differentiation, survival and migration and are frequently dysregulated in cancers.
 SNS-510 is a potent inhibitor of both active and inactive conformations of PDK1 and binds deep in the adaptive pocket, affecting both PH-domain and PIF-pocket interactions. As a result, SNS-510 blocks PDK1’s PI3K-dependent and independent signaling pathways. These activities were demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in preclinical models of hematologic and solid tumor cancers. Evaluation of SNS-510 in the Eurofins Oncopanel™, a panel of >300 genomically profiled cancer cell lines from diverse tissue origins, indicated that tumors with CDKN2A mutations or deletions are particularly sensitive to SNS-510. CDKN2A alterations are common in human cancers and may prove to be useful biomarkers for broad investigation of SNS-510 as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents. In other in vitro studies, SNS-510 had potent activity against a broad range of sarcoma cell lines. SNS-510 showed synergistic activity when combined with inhibitors of CDK4/6, KRAS G12C, or BCL-2 in breast cancer, sarcoma, KRAS-mutant, and lymphoma cell lines. In in vivo studies, SNS-510 demonstrated potent, pathway-mediated antitumor activity in FLT3-mutated and wild-type AML xenograft mouse models, as well as in a myc-activated, CDKN2A-deleted lymphoma xenograft mouse model.
 Several PI3K inhibitors are approved in hematologic malignancies and one is approved for PI3KCA-mutated breast cancers; AKT inhibitors are also in late stage development with promising results in combination with other agents in breast cancer. These successes highlight the important role inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis can play in the treatment of cancer. Inhibition of PDK1 by inhibitors, such as SNS-510, that block both PI3K-dependent and independent signaling may be more effective anticancer agents than inhibitors that target only PI3K/AKT. No PDK1 inhibitor has reached advanced development or approval to date.
 SNS-510 is a first-in-class therapeutic with the potential for broad spectrum single agent and combination activity in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. Sunesis is completing reporting of Investigational New Drug-enabling studies for SNS-510 and is evaluating the next steps for the program.
 Vecabrutinib (SNS-062)
 Vecabrutinib is a selective, reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor. BTK mediates signaling through the B-cell receptor, and is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival of normal and malignant B-lineage lymphoid cells. BTK has been well validated as a target for treatment of B-cell malignancies, with the covalent BTK inhibitors Imbruvica® (ibrutinib), Calquence® (acalabrutinib), and Brukinsa™ (zanabrutinib) approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are also approved for CLL, and ibrutinib is also approved for Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, chronic graft versus host disease (“cGVHD”), and marginal zone lymphoma.
 
6


In addition to vecabrutinib’s non-covalent inhibition of BTK, vecabrutinib inhibits interleukin-2 inducible kinase (“ITK”). Inhibition of ITK may improve anti-tumor T-cell activity, and inhibition of both BTK and ITK contributes to ibrutinib’s activity in cGVHD and also the improvement in outcome when combined with chimeric antigen receptor T (“CAR-T”) cell therapies. 
 
In June 2020, Sunesis announced that it will not advance its non-covalent BTK inhibitor vecabrutinib in the planned Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 trial for adults with relapsed or refractory CLL and other B-cell malignancies. The decision was made after assessing the totality of the data including the 500 mg cohort, the highest dose studied in the trial, as Sunesis found insufficient evidence of activity in BTK-inhibitor resistant disease to move the program into Phase 2.
 DAY101 (formerly TAK-580) 
 The Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf) are key regulators of cell proliferation and survival within the MAPK pathway. Pan-RAF inhibitors such as DAY101 are able to regulate MAPK pathway activation that are driven by RAF-monomer signaling, such as BRAF V600 mutations, and are uniquely positioned to also inhibit RAF dimer signaling, which can drive cancers with RAS mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations, and RAF fusions.
 In February 2018, an investigator-sponsored trial was initiated evaluating DAY101 in Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma (PLGG), for which Sunesis believes the scientific rationale is compelling. PLGG accounts for nearly 30% of pediatric brain cancer, and Fusion-RAF proteins are present in a large proportion of these pediatric tumors. There is a significant unmet need for these children. DOT-1 has initiated a Phase 2 study in children and young adults with recurrent or progressive BRAF-altered low-grade gliomas.
 DAY101 had its origins in a collaboration agreement between Sunesis and Biogen. In March 2011, Biogen’s rights to this program were exclusively assigned to Takeda Oncology. In December 2019, Sunesis consented to Takeda Oncology’s assignment of DAY101 to DOT-1, a venture capital-funded biopharmaceutical company. Sunesis entered into a concurrent DOT-1 License Agreement to grant DOT-1 a worldwide, exclusive license of DAY101. Pursuant to the DOT-1 License Agreement, Sunesis received a $2.0 million upfront payment from DOT-1. The DOT-1 License Agreement also includes up to $57.0 million in potential pre-commercialization, event-based milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of DAY101, when and if approved and commercialized. On February 10, 2021, Sunesis received a $3.0 million development milestone payment from DOT-1 pursuant to the DOT-1 License Agreement.
 Vosaroxin
 Vosaroxin is an anti-cancer quinolone derivative that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme critical for cell replication, resulting in replication-dependent, site-selective DNA damage, G2 arrest and apoptosis. In December 2019, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”) assigned its worldwide rights to vosaroxin to Sunesis (the “Sumitomo Assignment”). Also, in December 2019, Sunesis entered into an agreement to license vosaroxin to Denovo, pursuant to which Sunesis received a $200,000 upfront payment and are eligible to receive up to $57.0 million in potential regulatory and commercial milestones, and double-digit royalties on future sales of vosaroxin, when and if approved and commercialized.
License, Collaboration and Royalty Agreements 
 Vecabrutinib and SNS-510 Licensing and Collaboration Agreements 
 Overview 
 In August 2004, Sunesis entered into the original collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen OCA”) to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule inhibitors of the human protein Raf kinase, including family members Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, (collectively “Raf”), and up to five additional targets that play a role in oncology and immunology indications such as BTK and PDK1.
 In June 2008, the parties agreed to terminate the research term and related funding. In March 2011, as part of a series of agreements among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda Oncology, Sunesis entered into: (a) an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen 1st ARCA”); (b) a license agreement with Takeda Oncology (the “Takeda Agreement”); and (c) a termination and transition agreement among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda Oncology (the “Termination and Transition Agreement”).
 
The Termination and Transition Agreement provided for the termination of Biogen’s exclusive rights under the Biogen OCA to all discovery programs under such agreement other than for small molecule inhibitors of the human protein BTK and the permitted assignment to Takeda Oncology of all related Biogen collaboration assets and rights to Raf kinase and the human protein PDK1. 
 Biogen  
 In December 2013, Sunesis entered into a second amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen, which amended and restated the Biogen 1st ARCA, to provide Sunesis with an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and 
 7


commercialize vecabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor synthesized under the Biogen 1st ARCA, solely for oncology indications. During the third quarter of 2017, Sunesis made a milestone payment of $2.5 million to Biogen upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and activity of vecabrutinib in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies after two or more prior therapies, including ibrutinib or other covalent BTK inhibitors, and including patients with BTK C481 mutations. Sunesis may also be required to make royalty payments on product sales of vecabrutinib. 
 Takeda Oncology
 Under the Takeda Agreement, we granted exclusive licenses to products against two oncology, Raf and PDK1, under substantially the same terms as under the Biogen OCA. 
 In January 2014, Sunesis entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Takeda Oncology (the “Amended Takeda Agreement”), to provide Sunesis with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize preclinical inhibitors of PDK1. In December 2019, Sunesis partitioned the Amended Takeda Agreement into two separate agreements: (i) an amended and restated license agreement for PDK (the “PDK Agreement”), and (ii) an amended and restated license agreement for RAF (the “Millennium RAF Agreement”). Pursuant to the PDK Agreement, Sunesis may in the future be required to pay up to $9.2 million in pre-commercialization milestone payments depending on Sunesis’s development of PDK1 inhibitors and royalty payments depending on related product sales. 
DAY101 (formerlyTAK-580) License Agreements
 In December 2019, Sunesis consented to Takeda Oncology’s assignment of the Millennium RAF Agreement to DOT-1, a venture capital-funded biopharmaceutical company. Concurrent with this assignment, Sunesis entered into the DOT-1 License Agreement to grant DOT-1 a worldwide, exclusive license of DAY101. Pursuant to the DOT-1 License Agreement, Sunesis received a $2.0 million upfront payment from DOT-1. The agreement includes up to $57.0 million in potential pre-commercialization, event-based milestone payments and royalty payments to Sunesis on future sales of DAY101, when and if approved and commercialized. On February 10, 2021, Sunesis received a $3.0 million development milestone payment from DOT-1 pursuant to the DOT-1 License Agreement. 
Vosaroxin License Agreements
 In December 2019, Sunesis also entered into the Denovo Agreement to license vosaroxin intellectual property to Denovo, pursuant to which Sunesis received a $200,000 upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $57.0 million in regulatory and commercial milestones and double-digit royalties on future sales of vosaroxin, when and if approved and commercialized. 
Manufacturing 
 Sunesis relies on, and expects to continue to rely on, a limited number of third-party CMOs for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of all of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), including vecabrutinib and SNS-510 and the finished drug product (“FDP”) incorporating the APIs. Vecabrutinib API and FDP are manufactured under master services agreements.
 Sunesis currently relies on one contract manufacturer for vecabrutinib API and one for FDP. Four lots of API and FDP have been manufactured at a clinical scale. Scale-up to commercial scale has not been done. The cost to manufacture vecabrutinib at large scale is being determined.
 Competition 
 The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and Sunesis faces significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching, developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of cancer. Many of Sunesis’s competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than Sunesis does. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing drugs.
 With respect to vecabrutinib, Sunesis is aware of a number of companies that continue to develop and market covalent BTK inhibitors, including AbbVie, AstraZeneca PLC, BeiGene, Ltd., EMD Merck, Gilead, Sanofi, and others in oncology and non-oncology indications. Other noncovalent BTK inhibitors including those from Aptose Bisociences Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Merck & Company Inc. and others are in development. Merck & Company Inc.’s ARQ 531 and Eli Lilly and Company’s LOXO-305 have demonstrated robust activity in BTK inhibitor-resistant patients. Other approved drugs that may compete to treat BTK inhibitor naïve and covalent BTK inhibitor-resistant patients, include: AbbVie’s Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”)’s idelalisib PI3K inhibitor, TG Therapeutics, Inc.’s umbralisib PI3K inhibitor, Verastem’s duvelisib PI3K inhibitor, and CAR-T cell therapies such as Novartis tisagenlecleucel and Gilead’s axicabtagene ciloleucel.

Intellectual Property 
 Sunesis believes that patent protection is very important to its business and that its future success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents protecting vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or future drug candidates, if any. Historically, Sunesis has patented a wide range of technology, inventions and improvements related to its business. When appropriate, Sunesis seeks orphan drug status and/or data exclusivity in the United States and their equivalents in other relevant jurisdictions, to the maximum extent that the respective laws will permit at such time. For an approved medicine, such designation may, in the European Union, provide ten years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries, or seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S.
Vecabrutinib Patent Assets
 U.S. Patent Nos. 8,785,440 and 9,249,146 cover a genus of compounds encompassing vecabrutinib and methods of use thereof, respectively, with expiry in 2030. Counterpart applications and patents are held in the U.S., Europe, and other countries, with expiry in 2030.
 U.S. Patent Nos. 9,394,277 and 10,618,887 cover a subgenus of compounds including vecabrutinib, and methods of use thereof, respectively, with expiry in 2033. Counterpart applications and patents are held in the U.S., Europe, and other countries, with expiry in 2033.
 U.S. Patent App. No. 16/319,506 covers a vecabrutinib succinic acid complex form, and methods of use thereof. Counterpart applications are pending in Europe and other countries. The applications, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2037.
 As of February 17, 2021, Sunesis owns, co-owns or has rights to approximately 108 granted U.S. and foreign patents, five allowed foreign applications, and approximately 42 pending U.S. and foreign applications, pertaining to vecabrutinib and compositions and methods of use thereof. As noted above, the expiries of these granted patents and patents that may be granted range from 2030 to 2037.  
 
SNS-510 Patent Assets
 U.S. Patent Nos. 9,546,165 and 10,030,016, cover a genus of compounds including SNS-510, and methods of use thereof, respectively. Counterpart applications and patents are held in the U.S., Europe, and other countries, with expiry in 2030.
 U.S. Patent App. No. 15/770,369 covers methods of using SNS-510. Counterpart applications are pending in Europe and other countries. The applications, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2036.
 U.S. Patent App. No. 16/859,111 covers certain pharmaceutical compositions including SNS-510, and methods of use thereof. The application, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2038. 
 As of February 17, 2021, Sunesis owns, co-owns or has rights to approximately 91 granted U.S. and foreign patents, two allowed foreign applications, and approximately 28 pending U.S. and foreign applications, pertaining to SNS-510 and compositions and methods of use thereof. As noted above, the expiries of these granted patents and patents that may be granted range from 2030 to 2038.  
 General
 While it is possible that patent term restoration and/or supplemental patent certificates could be available for some of these or other patents Sunesis owns or controls through licenses after possible approval of commercial product, Sunesis cannot guarantee that such additional protection will be obtained, and the expiration dates described here do not include such term restoration.
 Our commercial success depends on Sunesis’s ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Sunesis cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect Sunesis’s ability to conduct Sunesis’s business. The existence of third-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to Sunesis and limit Sunesis’s ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. If patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid, Sunesis may be enjoined from pursuing research, development or commercialization of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, DAY101 (formerly TAK-580), or future drug candidates, if any, or be required to obtain licenses to such patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology.
 Sunesis also relies on trade secrets to protect its technology, especially in situations or jurisdictions in which Sunesis believes patent protection may not be appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and do not protect technology against independent developments made by third parties. Sunesis seeks to protect its proprietary information by requiring Sunesis’s employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with Sunesis’s employees also prevent them from bringing the 
 9


proprietary rights of third parties to Sunesis. Sunesis also requires confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive its confidential data or materials. Sunesis seeks to protect its company name and the names of its products and technologies by obtaining trademark registrations, as well as common law rights in trademarks and service marks, in the United States and in other countries.
 Government Regulation 
 The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state and local regulatory agencies and non-US regulatory authorities impose substantial legal requirements, directives and guidelines upon any clinical investigation of a new drug. These agencies regulate activities including current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”), quality assurance and control testing, documentation, approval, storage, packaging, labeling, distribution, Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), safety, efficacy, advertising and promotion of Sunesis’s product candidates and any future drug candidates Sunesis may develop, if any. The application of these regulatory frameworks to the development, approval and commercialization of Sunesis’s drug candidates will take several years to accomplish, if at all, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implements regulations. The process required by the FDA before any of Sunesis’s drug candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory manufacturing at facilities which the product candidate is produced under cGMP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication conducted under GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including proposed labeling (package insert information) and promotional materials, prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Preclinical Testing and INDs 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. Laboratories that comply with the FDA GLP regulations must conduct preclinical safety tests. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Protection of Human Subjects regulations and GCP, under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. 
 In addition, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each institution where the study will be conducted. Each IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements and regulations for informed consent. 
 10


Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap, sometimes followed by a fourth phase: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety (adverse effects), dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. In some cases, particularly in cancer trials, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 1b” evaluation, which is a safety-focused, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 2b” evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory Phase 2 clinical trial that could, if positive and accepted by the FDA, serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a drug candidate has potential activity in a disease or condition and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 (post-marketing) clinical trials may be required by the FDA in some cases. The FDA may conditionally approve an NDA for a drug candidate on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and/or efficacy after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Drug Applications 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months of filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Sunesis may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in Sunesis’s efforts to develop its product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude Sunesis from marketing its products. 
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial 
 11


additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The United States Orphan Drug Act promotes the development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Upon receipt of orphan drug designation from the FDA, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, waiver of PDUFA application fee, and upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. 
 In the European Union, orphan status is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 people and provides for the potential for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. The marketing exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Any drugs manufactured or distributed by Sunesis, or its current or potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon Sunesis and its third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by Sunesis and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, including cancer therapy. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict Sunesis’s business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.
 12


Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, Sunesis may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. These laws may affect Sunesis’s sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens.
 Efforts to ensure that Sunesis’s business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that Sunesis’s business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If Sunesis’s operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to Sunesis, Sunesis may be subject to a wide range of sanctions and penalties, potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of Sunesis’s operations, any of which could adversely affect Sunesis’s ability to operate its business and its results of operations. Sunesis is unable to predict whether it would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect Sunesis’s financial performance and disrupt its business operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products, when and if approved for marketing, depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which Sunesis obtains regulatory approval. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Sunesis to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Sunesis’s investment in product development.
 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Sunesis may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of its products. The product candidates that Sunesis develops may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for Sunesis to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for Sunesis’s product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover Sunesis’s product candidates could reduce physician usage of its products once approved and have a material adverse effect on Sunesis’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow Sunesis to sell its products on a competitive and profitable basis. Coverage policies and third-
 13


party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which Sunesis receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect Sunesis’s ability to sell its products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, such as the 
ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to Sunesis’s business are that it: created an annual fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and eliminating the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and Sunesis’s business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as other legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest 
 14


price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., Sunesis is subject to foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of or Sunesis’s drug candidates. Whether or not Sunesis obtains FDA approval for a product, Sunesis must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, permission to conduct clinical research is granted by the Competent Authority of each European Member State (“MS”), and the applicable Ethics Committees (“EC”), through the submission of a Clinical Trial Application. An EC in the European Union serves the same function as an IRB in the United States. The review times vary by MS but may not exceed 60 days. The EC has a maximum of 60 days to give its opinion on the acceptability of the Clinical Trial Application to both the governing MS and the sponsor applicant. If the application is deemed acceptable, the MS informs the applicant (or does not within the 60-day window inform the applicant of non-acceptance) and Sunesis may proceed with the clinical trial.
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, Sunesis must submit a marketing authorization application (an “MAA”) under the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization from the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) that is valid in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which includes all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.
 In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. A European Union orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once a marketing authorization is obtained for a pediatric indication in all Member States of the European Union and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, Sunesis will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of Sunesis’s product candidates. Sunesis’s ability to sell drugs will also depend on the availability of reimbursement from government and private insurance companies.
