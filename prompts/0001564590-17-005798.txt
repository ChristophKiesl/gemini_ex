Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 We are an oncology-focused company applying our proprietary Dynamic Tumor Targeting™ Platform, or the Platform, to develop differentiated therapies. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 28, 2005, under the name Tempo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In October 2008, we changed our name to Cerulean Pharma Inc. 
 Recent Developments
 In February 2017, we announced that our board of directors initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, our board determined to review alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, including a potential sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of company assets.
 On March 19, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, with Daré Bioscience, Inc., or Daré, and the holders of capital stock and securities convertible into capital stock of Daré named therein, or the Selling Stockholders, pursuant to which, among other things, the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell to us, and we agreed to purchase from the Selling Stockholders, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, including those issuable upon conversion of convertible securities, of Daré.  We refer to this transaction as the Daré Transaction. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the Daré Transaction, the Selling Stockholders will collectively receive a number of shares of Cerulean common stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Daré stock held by such Selling Stockholder multiplied by an exchange ratio calculated based on the relative valuations of each of Daré and Cerulean at the closing of the Daré Transaction. Also in connection with the Daré Transaction, Cerulean will assume the (i) outstanding stock option awards of Daré, and (ii) outstanding warrants of Daré, each of which will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio for the Daré Transaction. Immediately following the closing of the Daré Transaction, we expect that the Selling Stockholders will own between approximately 51% and 70% (depending on the net cash positions of us and Daré at closing) of the outstanding equity securities of Cerulean Pharma Inc.
 Consummation of the Daré Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, (1) approval of the issuance of the shares of our common stock in the Daré Transaction by our stockholders in accordance with applicable NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., or NASDAQ, rules, which (assuming a quorum is present) require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter (excluding broker non-votes and abstentions), (2) the absence of any order, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction or statute, rule or regulation that makes the consummation of the Daré Transaction illegal, or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Daré Transaction, and (3) the approval of the NASDAQ Initial Listing Application—For Companies Conducting a Business Combination that Results in a Change of Control with respect to the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Daré Transaction. Each party’s obligation to consummate the Daré Transaction is also subject to other specified customary conditions, including (1) the representations and warranties of the other party (with Daré and the Selling Stockholders being considered together for such purposes) being true and correct as of the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement and as of the closing date of the Daré Transaction, generally subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification, and (2) the performance in all material respects by the other party (with 
 1


Daré and the Selling Stockholders being considered together for such purposes) of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Daré, and further provides that, upon termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Daré a termination fee of $0.3 million, or Daré may be required to pay us a termination fee of $0.45 million. There can be no assurances that the Daré Transaction will be consummated.
 On March 19, 2017, we also entered into an asset purchase agreement, or the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement, with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis.  Under the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement we agreed to sell and assign to Novartis all of our right, title and interest in and to the patent rights, know-how and third-party license agreements relating to the Platform.  We also agreed to transfer and assign to Novartis any agreements that we have with third parties conducting research, development, or manufacturing activities with the Platform.  We refer to this transaction as the Novartis Transaction. At the closing of the Novartis Transaction, Novartis will be obligated to pay us a purchase price of $6.0 million.
 Consummation of the Novartis Transaction is subject to us obtaining, pursuant to Delaware law, the approval of the holders of at least a majority of our common stock for the sale of substantially all of its assets in the Novartis Transaction.  Each party’s obligation to consummate the Novartis Transaction is also subject to other specified customary conditions, including (1) the representations and warranties of the other party being true and correct as of the closing date of the Novartis Transaction, generally subject in the case of Novartis’ representations and warranties to an overall materiality qualification, and (2) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement, including in our case by obtaining all necessary corporate and third-party consents. There can be no assurances that the Novartis Transaction will be consummated.
 On March 19, 2017, we also entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with BlueLink Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or BlueLink, a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation.  We refer to this as the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement.  Under the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement we sold and assigned to BlueLink all of our right, title and interest in and to our clinical product candidates CRLX101 and CRLX301, or the Products. We also transferred and assigned to BlueLink the accompanying intellectual property rights and know-how to the Products.  On March 21, 2017, BlueLink paid the purchase price of $1.5 million.  Also in connection with the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, we and BlueLink entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we granted to BlueLink an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable right and license, under the Platform, to research, develop and commercialize the Products. Pursuant to the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement, Novartis will assume this license agreement upon the closing of the Novartis Transaction.
 We refer to the Daré Transaction, the Novartis Transaction and the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement as the 2017 Strategic Transactions.
  We entered into a payoff letter dated as of March 17, 2017, with Hercules Capital, Inc. (formerly known as Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc.), or Hercules, pursuant to which we agreed to pay off and thereby terminate our Loan and Security Agreement dated as of January 8, 2015, or the Hercules Loan Agreement, with Hercules as lender. Pursuant to the payoff letter, we paid, on March 20, 2017, a total of $12.4 million to Hercules, representing the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, costs and expenses outstanding under the Hercules Loan Agreement in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement. This payoff amount included a final end of term charge to Hercules in the amount of $1.4 million, representing 6.7% of the aggregate original principal amount advanced by Hercules. Upon the payment of the $12.4 million pursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations to Hercules under the Hercules Loan Agreement were deemed paid in full, and the Hercules Loan Agreement was terminated.
 On March 20, 2017, we announced a restructuring including the elimination of approximately 58% of our workforce, to a total of eight full-time equivalent employees, under a plan expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.
 Overview
 The Platform is designed to create nanoparticle-drug conjugates, or NDCs, with the aim of providing safer and more effective therapies for patients living with cancer.  NDCs consist of anti-cancer therapeutics, or payloads, covalently linked to a proprietary polymer.  An important goal for all drugs is to maximize the net clinical benefit by increasing the desired therapeutic effect while reducing adverse effects.  This is especially difficult with drugs used to treat cancer, where the goal is to destroy or inhibit growth of cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.  We believe NDCs concentrate their anti-cancer payloads inside tumor cells while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass through the leaky pores of new blood vessels in tumors as an entry portal into tumor tissue, but are too large to pass through the pores of healthy blood vessels. Once inside tumors, we believe NDCs are actively taken up into tumor cells where they slowly release their anti-cancer payloads, providing a durable inhibition of their targets.  
 Based on their properties and design, NDCs have the potential to enable synergistic combination therapies that can offer better tolerability and efficacy.  We believe that better tolerability can be achieved through the preferential accumulation of the NDC in the 
 2


tumor cells while better efficacy can be achieved by combining drugs that have different and complementary mechanisms of action.  Cancer is a multi-faceted disease that is rarely adequately addressed by one therapy.  Tumor cells are genetically diverse and can rapidly resist and ultimately overcome a single-agent therapy by modulating various adaptive pathways; however, if multiple drugs simultaneously shut down multiple adaptive pathways, there is a greater chance of achieving favorable disease responses for an extended period of time.  
 The Platform generated two clinical-stage NDCs.  The first clinical candidate generated by the Platform, CRLX101, is an NDC with a camptothecin payload.  Camptothecin is a potent topoisomerase 1, or topo 1, inhibitor that was too toxic to develop in the clinic; however, CRLX101 reduces the toxicities associated with this highly potent agent, while increasing the payload concentration in tumors. The second clinical candidate generated by the Platform, CRLX301, is an NDC with a docetaxel payload.  Docetaxel is a commercially successful oncology drug that suffers from significant toxicities.  We sold both clinical candidates to BlueLink on March 19, 2017.  
 In August 2016, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of CRLX101 in combination with Avastin in the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. We refer to this trial as the RCC Trial.  The RCC Trial was conducted at 43 sites in the United States and South Korea, and enrolled 115 patients with RCC who progressed through two or three prior lines of therapy. Patients were randomized to receive CRLX101 in combination with Avastin or investigator’s choice standard of care, or SOC, therapy. The primary endpoint was progression free survival, or PFS, in the clear cell population assessed by independent radiological review. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.  The study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median PFS and objective response rate for the CRLX101 and Avastin combination compared to SOC. The CRLX101 and Avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in previous studies. We presented the full data set from the RCC Trial at the Fifteenth International Kidney Cancer Symposium in November 2016. Based on these top-line results, we submitted a letter to the FDA voluntarily surrendering the Fast Track Designation in metastatic RCC we received in April 2015.  We discontinued development of CRLX101 in this indication.
 Following the announcement of the RCC Trial data, we announced in August 2016 that our board of directors approved a plan to reduce the size of our workforce by approximately 48% to a total of 23 full-time equivalent employees. The workforce reduction, which was substantially completed in December 2016, was designed to reduce our operating expenses while we conducted a review of development options for CRLX101.  As of December 31, 2016, we had 19 full-time employees. 
 The Platform: Dynamically Tumor Targeted NDCs 
 The Platform has the potential to create additional NDCs for development by us or in collaboration with our partners.  For example, in October 2016 we announced a collaboration with Novartis pursuant to which we are to create NDC candidates using the Platform and Novartis-selected active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Novartis will be responsible for the development and commercialization of NDC product candidates resulting from our collaborative research efforts.  The initial research term of the collaboration agreement is two years, which can be extended for up to two additional one-year terms. We received a $5.0 million upfront payment under the collaboration agreement, and are entitled to receive additional research, development, regulatory and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales of any NDC product commercialized by Novartis.  In addition, we are entitled to receive funding for up to five full-time employees to be engaged in activities under the collaboration during the research term.  If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, this collaboration agreement will be superseded by the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement.
Our Corporate Strategy 
 Prior to the 2017 Strategic Transactions, our 
goal had been 
to leverage our Platform to discover, develop and commercialize NDCs for the treatment of patients with inadequately treated diseases.  
In view of the closing of our sale of our key clinical assets pursuant to the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, our goa
l is to consummate the Daré Transaction and the Novartis Transaction, each of which is subject to stockholder approval. More specifically:
  
• | If our stockholders approve both transactions, all other applicable closing conditions are satisfied or waived and both transactions are consummated, Novartis would purchase our Platform for $6.0 million and our stockholders from prior to the Daré Transaction would hold a minority equity position in Cerulean following the Daré Transaction, which we expect would be between approximately 30% and 49% (depending on the net cash positions of us and Daré at closing) of the outstanding equity securities of Cerulean.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If our stockholders approve the Daré Transaction but do not approve the Novartis Transaction:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3


 
stockholders prior to the Daré Transaction would likely be reduced as a result of our having less cash on hand at the closing of the Daré Transaction; and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Cerulean would continue to own, following the Daré Transaction, the Platform technology, subject to the currently existing Novartis collaboration, and the board, in consultation with the management team, will make a determination regarding further exploitation of these rights; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | If we attempt to sell the Platform to another third party or if our board decides to continue operating the Platform, Novartis may exercise its termination rights under the currently existing collaboration agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If our stockholders do not approve the Daré Transaction, then our stockholders will continue to hold their current equity in Cerulean and our board will make a determination at that time concerning the future course of our company, which could include the wind-down of Cerulean and the distribution of its assets to stockholders. If our stockholders approve, and we are able to consummate, the Novartis Transaction, the purchase price of $6.0 million could increase the assets available for distribution to our stockholders in any such wind-down and liquidation.

Our Product Pipeline
 We currently do not have any product candidates in development.  In March 2017, we sold CRLX101 and CRLX301 to BlueLink.
 Our Collaborators
 A key component to our strategy is to collaborate with other companies to discover and develop new NDCs using the Platform. In October 2016 we announced a research collaboration with Novartis pursuant to which we are to create NDC candidates using the Platform and Novartis-selected active pharmaceutical ingredients.  If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, this collaboration agreement will be superseded by the Novartis Asset Purchase Agreement.
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we may successfully develop and commercialize would compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Companies with marketed nanotechnology-based oncology products include Celgene Corporation (Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) indicated for breast cancer, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer), Janssen Products, LP (Doxil indicated for ovarian cancer and, in combination with Velcade® (bortezomib), for multiple myeloma), Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OnivydeTM (irinotecan liposome injection) indicated for pancreatic and colorectal cancer) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Marqibo® (vincristine sulfate liposome injection) indicated for relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Companies with nanotechnology-based oncology product candidates in clinical development include, without limitation, BlueLink (a wholly owned subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation, now developing CRLX101 and CRLX301), Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPX-351 for acute myeloid leukemia), Celsion Corporation (ThermoDox (lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin) for liver cancer and breast cancer), Cytimmune Sciences, Inc. (CYT-6091 for NSCLC), Cristal Delivery B.V. d/b/a Cristal Therapeutics (CriPec® docetaxel for oncology), Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR102 for solid tumors), Nippon Kayku Seizo Co., Ltd. (NK105 in breast cancer), Starpharma Holdings Ltd. (DEP® docetaxel for oncology), and Supratek Pharma Inc. (SP1049C for solid tumors).
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any therapeutic product candidates that we may develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payors.

Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to protect, for example, the technology platforms that we may use to generate product candidates, related technologies and/or other aspects of the inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary positions.
 If we are unable to consummate the Novartis Transaction and/or the Daré Transaction, we may continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to improvements of the Platform as well as dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional compositions created or identified from the Platform and development of any product candidate we may choose to develop. In such event, our success would depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Patents 
 Prior to 
entering into the 
2017 Strategic Transactions, our patent portfolio included 
issued patents and pending applications worldwide. These patents and applications fell into three broad categories: (1) NDCs comprising covalent linkage of specific therapeutic agents to our proprietary cyclodextrin polyethylene polymer, or CDP, including without limitation CRLX101 and CRLX301; (2) methods of use of our NDCs, including without limitation CRLX1
01 and CRLX301; and (3) our evolving Platform relating to polymeric NDCs. We held issued patents in the United States, Japan, and several other countries, covering the Platform and the conjugation of our proprietary polymer using linkers to a variety of th
erapeutic agents (including without limitation CRLX101 and CRLX301), that expire in 2023 and 2024, excluding any potential patent term extension.
 Pursuant to the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, we sold our patent families relating specifically and solely to composition of matter and/or methods of use of CRLX101 and CRLX301 to BlueLink and granted to BlueLink an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable right and license, under the Platform, to research, develop and commercialize CRLX101 and CRLX301.  
 If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, (1) our patents relating to the covalent linkage of specific therapeutic agents to our CDP (including specific claims relating to the composition of matter of CRLX101), methods of use of NDCs generally, and the Platform generally will be sold to Novartis, and (2) Novartis will assume the license agreement to BlueLink relating to the Platform.  Upon the consummation of the Novartis Agreement, we will have sold all of the company’s intellectual property rights.
 Patent Term 
 The base term of a United States patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a United States patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In some cases, the term of a United States patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. 
 The term of a United States patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one United States patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when any pharmaceutical products we may choose to develop receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture. 
 Trade Secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent 
 5


protection. For example, significant elements of the making and formulating of NDCs are based on trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. 
 Trademarks 
 We also seek trademark protection in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where available and when appropriate. The name “CERULEAN” is a registered trademark in the United States, Australia, China, the European Union, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Norway, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and Ukraine and is covered by a pending application for trademark registration in Canada. The trademark is solely owned by Cerulean Pharma Inc., in the field of pharmaceutical preparations as well as in the field of diagnostic and prognostic preparations. The Cerulean logo is a registered trademark in the United States and is solely owned by Cerulean Pharma Inc. CERULEAN with the Cerulean logo is a registered trademark in Mexico and is solely owned by Cerulean Pharma Inc.  The term “Leadership in Nanopharmaceuticals” is a registered trademark in the United States and is solely owned by Cerulean Pharma Inc. The symbol ™ indicates an unregistered trademark. Other service marks, trademarks and trade names appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners. 
 Assignments and In-License Agreements 
 Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 In June 2009, we entered into two agreements with Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Calando, the CRLX101 Agreement and the Platform Agreement, each of which we subsequently amended. Under these agreements, Calando assigned and licensed to us certain assets. These assets include the clinical asset then known as IT-101, later renamed CRLX101, and rights to Calando’s cyclodextrin system for purposes of conjugating or complexing certain other therapeutic agents to the system. 
CRLX101 Agreement: 
 Under the CRLX101 Agreement, we obtained certain rights to CRLX101. As noted below in the description of the Platform Agreement, Calando also assigned to us certain patents and patent applications, including, with respect to composition of matter and methods of use, for CRLX101. In addition, under the CRLX101 Agreement, Calando transferred ownership of the CRLX101 IND to Cerulean. Also, under the CRLX101 Agreement, Calando initially granted to us a worldwide, royalty bearing, exclusive (even as to Calando) license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to Calando’s interest under certain patents, patent applications, and know-how owned or controlled by Calando, to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CRLX101 formulated for intravenous, intrarterial, intrathecal and/or intraperitoneal therapy, to treat and/or prevent disease in humans. As noted below in the description of the Caltech Agreement, all of the patents, patent applications and know-how that were initially licensed to us by Calando under the CRLX101 Agreement and upon which CRLX101 is dependent are now directly licensed to us by Caltech, and we retained the license described above from Calando for patents, patent applications and know-how that are directed to other aspects of the cyclodextrin system but on which CRLX101 is not dependent. For purposes of our obligations to Calando under the CRLX101 Agreement, we treat the intellectual property licensed to us by Caltech as if it were still licensed to us by Calando. 
 Under the CRLX101 Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop CRLX101 throughout the world and, following the first commercial sale of CRLX101 in a particular country, to make CRLX101 commercially available in such country. 
 6


Upon entering the CRLX101 Agreement, we paid Calando approximately $1.3 million, which included the purchase of CRLX101 drug substance and drug product inventory. If we achieve certain development and sales events with CRLX101, we are obligated to pay milestone payments which could total, in the aggregate, $32.8 million. If we or one of our affiliates sells CRLX101, we are also required to pay tiered royalty payments ranging from low-to mid-single digits, depending on whether or not there is patent protection for CRLX101 at the time of sale as a percentage of worldwide net sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country begin on the date of first commercial sale of CRLX101 in that country and end on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale of CRLX101 in that country or the expiration of all patents licensed to us by Caltech or Calando, referred to as Licensed Patent Rights, or assigned to us by Calando, referred to as the Assigned Patent Rights, which cover CRLX101 in that country. With respect to CRLX101 that is developed and sold by an unaffiliated third party to whom we grant a license or sublicense under any of the intellectual property that we purchased or licensed from Calando, we are required to pay Calando a percentage of the income we receive from the licensee or sublicensee to the extent attributable to such license or sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. The percentage of such sublicense income that we are obligated to pay Calando is in the low- to mid-double digits, and varies depending on the stage of development of CRLX101 at the time that we first provide or receive draft terms of a license arrangement with the third party that results in a license arrangement, unless the negotiations terminate, in which case the percentage depends on the development stage of CRLX101 when the negotiations restart. 
 We have the first right to enforce the Licensed Patent Rights and Assigned Patent Rights, other than one subset of licensed patents on which CRLX101 is not dependent, which Calando has the sole right to enforce. 
 We and Calando are required to indemnify each other for losses and expenses in connection with any third party claims arising out of the indemnifying party’s breach of the CRLX101 Agreement, the negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its affiliates or sublicensees under the CRLX101 Agreement or any product liability arising out of CRLX101 developed, made, used or sold by or on behalf of the indemnifying party or its affiliates or sublicensees. 
 The CRLX101 Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Calando. We also have the right to terminate the CRLX101 Agreement for any reason on thirty days prior notice to Calando, in which case, unless we certify that the termination was due to specified safety concerns with CRLX101, we will grant Calando an exclusive (even as to Cerulean), royalty-free license, under the Assigned Patent Rights, to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CRLX101, we will assign the IND for CRLX101 to Calando and, if consistent with our business plans, we will discuss granting Calando a license under know-how that we developed that relates to CRLX101. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations under the CRLX101 Agreement after a specified cure period, the license may convert to a non-exclusive license and we will have to grant Calando a non-exclusive license under the Assigned Patent Rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CRLX101. If the license is converted to a non-exclusive license, the royalties payable to Calando will be reduced by a specified percentage. If we fail to meet our payment obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Calando can terminate the agreement, we are obligated to grant Calando an exclusive (even as to Cerulean), royalty-free license, under the Assigned Patent Rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CRLX101 and to assign the IND for CRLX101 to Calando, resulting in our loss of rights to CRLX101. If we or one of our affiliates challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, Calando has the right to terminate the agreement. For any breach of the CRLX101 Agreement not described above, the non-breaching party’s sole remedy if such breach is not cured within a specified time period is to seek money damages from the breaching party. 
 If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, the CRLX101 Agreement will be assigned to Novartis.  Pursuant to the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, BlueLink will be responsible for the continued development of CRLX101 and the payment of further milestones and royalties, as described above.
 Platform Agreement:
 Under the Platform Agreement, Calando assigned to us the Assigned Patent Rights and granted to us a worldwide, royalty bearing, exclusive (even as to Calando) license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to Calando’s interest under certain patents, patent applications, and know-how owned or controlled by Calando (a) to conduct research and development on the cyclodextrin system, including making improvements thereto, in order to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CDP-based Products and (b) to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CDP-based Products. The field of the license is the treatment and/or prevention of disease in humans. CDP-based Products are defined as products conjugated or complexed to the cyclodextrin system, other than any products containing cytolysin, tubulysin, certain second generation epothilones or a nucleic acid, which we refer to as Retained Products, and CRLX101, which is covered by the CRLX101 Agreement described above. Under the Platform Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop CDP-based Products throughout the world and, following the first commercial sale of CDP-based Product in a particular country, to make CDP-based Product commercially available in such country.

Upon entering the Platform Agreement, we paid to Calando approximately $1.2 million, which included the payment for assignment of the Assigned Patent Rights and cyclodextrin-containing polymers and precursor inventory. We granted Calando a worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive (even as to Cerulean), perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Assigned Patent Rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, sell and import the Retained Products. 
 If we achieve certain development and sales events with respect to any CDP-based Product, we are obligated to pay milestone payments which could total, in the aggregate, $18.0 million per CDP-based Product.  Upon the initiation of our CRLX301 Phase 1 trial in December 2014, we made a milestone payment of $250,000 to Calando in January 2015.  If we or one of our affiliates sells a CDP-based Product, we are also required to pay tiered royalty payments ranging from low-to mid-single digits, depending on whether or not there is patent protection at the time of sale, as a percentage of worldwide net sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country begin on the first date of first commercial sale of the CDP-based Product in that country and end on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale of that CDP-based Product in that country or the expiration of all patents licensed or assigned from Calando which cover that CDP-based Product in that country. With respect to a CDP-based Product that is developed and sold by a third party to whom we grant a license or sublicense under any of the intellectual property that we licensed from Calando or that Calando assigned to us, we are required to pay Calando a percentage of the income we receive from the licensee or sublicensee to the extent attributable to such license or sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. The percentage of such sublicense income that we are obligated to pay Calando does not exceed the low-double digits. 
 We have the first right to enforce the licensed patent rights and the Assigned Patent Rights, other than one subset of licensed patents which Calando has the sole right to enforce. 
 We and Calando are required to indemnify each other for losses and expenses in connection with any third party claims arising out of the indemnifying party’s breach of the Platform Agreement, the negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its affiliates or sublicensees under the Platform Agreement or any product liability arising out of a CDP-based Product developed, made, used or sold by or on behalf of the indemnifying party or its affiliates or sublicensees. Calando also indemnifies us for losses and expenses in connection with any third party claim arising out of a Retained Product developed, made, used or sold by or on behalf of Calando or its affiliates or licensees. 
 The Platform Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Calando. We also have the right to terminate the Platform Agreement for any reason on thirty days prior written notice to Calando, in which case we will grant Calando an exclusive (even as to Cerulean), royalty-free license, under Assigned Patent Rights, to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import the CDP-based Products and, if consistent with our business plans, we would discuss granting Calando a license under know-how that we developed that relates to the cyclodextrin system or CDP-based Products. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations under the agreement after a specified cure period, Calando may convert the license to a non-exclusive license and we will have to grant Calando a non-exclusive license under the Assigned Patent Rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CDP-based Products. If the license is converted to a non-exclusive license, the royalties payable to Calando will be reduced by a certain percentage. If we fail to meet our payment obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Calando can terminate the agreement, resulting in our loss of rights to the CDP-based Products and an obligation to grant Calando an exclusive (even as to Cerulean), royalty-free license, under the Assigned Patent Rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, market, offer to sell, distribute, sell and import CDP-based Products. If we or one of our affiliates challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, Calando has the right to terminate the agreement. For any breach of the Platform Agreement not described above, the non-breaching party’s sole remedy if such breach is not cured within a specified time period is to seek money damages from the breaching party. 
 If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, the Platform Agreement will be assigned to Novartis.  Pursuant to the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, BlueLink will be responsible for the continued development of CRLX301 and the payment of further milestones and royalties, as described above.
 California Institute of Technology 
 Certain of the patents, patent applications, and know-how licensed to us under the CRLX101 Agreement and the Platform Agreement were originally licensed to Calando by the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, pursuant to an agreement entered into between Calando and Caltech in May 2000 and subsequently amended, which we refer to as the Calando/Caltech Agreement. In August 2013, we entered into an agreement with Calando and Caltech under which Calando terminated its rights and obligations under the Calando/Caltech Agreement and Caltech agreed to directly honor the exclusive license, including the right to grant further sublicenses, granted to us by Calando under the Caltech intellectual property formerly licensed to Calando. 
 8


We are obligated to pay Caltech minimum annual royalties and the costs it incurs to prosecute and maintain the licensed patent rights. We may offset those prosecution and maintenance costs against any milestones or royalties that we owe to Calando under the CRLX101 Agreement or the Platform Agreement. 
 Following the earlier of our receipt of notice from Calando that it has made certain payments to third parties or the first anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product covered by the Caltech patent rights, we will directly pay to Caltech the amounts that it would have been entitled to receive from Calando with respect to our sales of the licensed products, and we will pay to Calando the remainder of the royalties we owe them under the CRLX101 Agreement and the Platform Agreement. 
 We have the first right to enforce the Caltech licensed patent rights. 
 We may terminate our rights and obligations to Caltech and Calando with respect to any of the Caltech licensed intellectual property either in its entirety or as to any jurisdiction or as to any part of the intellectual property upon a specified period of prior notice to Caltech and Calando. Caltech has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to make a payment, or otherwise materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within specified grace periods. 
 If the Novartis Transaction is consummated, the Caltech licensed patent rights will be assigned to Novartis.  Pursuant to the BlueLink Asset Purchase Agreement, BlueLink will be responsible for the continued development of CRLX101 and CRLX301 and the payment of royalties as described above.
 Manufacturing 
 We have contracted with third parties for the manufacture of NDCs for preclinical studies and clinical trials and may continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of NDCs. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities.
 The manufacture of NDCs requires the manufacture of complicated polymer backbone structures as well as therapeutic agents. Although these characteristics may limit alternative third party manufacturers, we believe that there are several sources of supply that can satisfy clinical and commercial requirements, including back-up suppliers for certain stages of the manufacturing process. We cannot be certain, however, that identifying and establishing relationships with secondary sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We have no current plans to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States necessary to effectively support the commercialization of any NDCs we may develop in the future, if approved.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export, of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and the successful outcome of those processes cannot be guaranteed. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of the clinical trial(s) by an independent institutional review board(s), or IRB(s), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trial(s) in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA summarizing available data to support the proposed approval of the new drug product for the proposed use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, as may be requested by the FDA to assist with its review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA inspection(s) of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees (per published PDUFA guidelines for that year) and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nonclinical Studies 
 Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product.  They also include in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug to start dose assessment for initial testing in humans and to further establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND for clinical investigation in the United States. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with IND and GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 
 In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol, major amendments and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 Phase 1: Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the 
 10


metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the toxicities associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but are generally smaller than later stage studies.  Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.
 Phase 2: Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
 Phase 3: Phase 3 studies are expanded trials, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects.
 Phase 4.  Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA through the IND and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.  In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.  The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients
 In order to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects and to verify the quality and integrity of data submitted to the FDA in support of marketing applications, the FDA monitors all aspects of FDA-regulated research through a comprehensive program of on-site inspections and data audits. Under the FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, FDA field investigators and headquarters’ scientists conduct site visits of research sponsors, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, IRBs, radioactive drug research committees, and non-clinical (animal) laboratories.
 In general, the FDA accepts foreign safety and efficacy studies that were not conducted under an IND provided that they are well designed, well conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conducted in accordance with ethical principles acceptable to the world community.  The conduct of these studies must meet at least minimum standards for assuring human subject protection.  Therefore, for studies submitted in support of an NDA that were conducted outside the U.S. and not under an IND, the agency requires demonstration that such studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.  
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies.
 11


When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply:
  
• | Patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician (see investigator-sponsored trials below) for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for:
  
• | individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | intermediate-size patient populations (groups of patients, n >1); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investigator-Sponsored Trials 
 Investigator-sponsored trials, or ISTs, are clinical trials where the investigator of the trial is also the “sponsor” of the trial for regulatory purposes. An “investigator” conducts clinical investigations and is the person under whose immediate direction the study drug is administered or dispensed to patients. A “sponsor” initiates and takes responsibility for a clinical investigation. A person who both initiates and conducts a clinical trial, and is responsible for all regulatory requirements, is designated as a “sponsor-investigator” by the FDA. Clinical investigators at academic medical centers who initiate clinical trials with a lawfully marketed drug to be used in a patient population or investigational (unapproved) indication often fit within this designation. In addition, as is the case with our ISTs, a company may provide a sponsor-investigator with supply of its unapproved product candidate and funding for the trial. Investigators who initiate and conduct such trials are responsible for obtaining an IND from the FDA and for ensuring compliance with the IND and associated regulatory requirements. As provided by the FDA’s regulations, the sponsor of a clinical trial is responsible for, among other things, selecting qualified investigators, providing them with the information they need to conduct the trial properly, ensuring proper monitoring of the trial, ensuring that the trial is conducted in accordance with the protocols contained in the IND, maintaining an effective IND with respect to the trial, and ensuring that the FDA, the company, and all participating investigators are promptly informed of significant new adverse effects or risks with respect to the drug. In contrast, in a company-sponsored trial, the pharmaceutical company whose drug will be studied is the sponsor of the trial and, as such, is responsible for ensuring compliance with all regulatory requirements, including obtaining the IND.  
 The terms of IST agreements customarily provide that (a) the institution is responsible for obtaining and maintaining any necessary IND for the trial, for conducting the trial in accordance with an agreed upon protocol and applicable regulatory requirements and for safety reporting to us, the IRB, and the FDA, (b) the institution grants to us a license to use the trial data for any legally permissible purpose and assigns or licenses to us all intellectual property rights relating to the drug, (c) we are responsible for supplying the drug and making agreed upon payments to the institution to fund the trial and (d) the term of the agreement is the duration of the applicable trial, however, the agreement can be terminated for convenience with notice, upon the request of an applicable regulatory agency, for safety reasons or following an uncured material breach by the other party. 
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
 Detailed information and results from preclinical and clinical studies and other requirements relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.03 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $97,000 per product and $510,000 per establishment for fiscal year 2017. Important exceptions or waivers for user fees include:
  
• | A small company (fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates) may submit a written request for a waiver by the FDA to waive the application fee for its first human drug application. After a waiver for a first human drug application is granted, the small business is assessed appropriate user fees for all subsequent human drug applications and supplements submitted for review. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | Products with orphan drug designation for a particular indication are not subject to an application user fee provided there are no other intended uses in the NDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. “Standard review”, representing most such applications is generally reviewed within ten months from the date of filing.  “Priority review”, as may be designated by the FDA for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, are targeted to be reviewed within six months from the date of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections usually cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites meeting specific criteria to assure compliance with GCP.  The FDA may also inspect the company to evaluate, for example, processes, safety reporting procedures, training and compliance with U.S. regulations as the sponsor.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, 
Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life
‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as 
fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track 
review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrat
es the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track 
products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of 
sections of a Fast Track 
product’s application before the appli
cation is complete. This 
rolling review 
may be available if 
the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a s
chedule for the submission of the remaining information and the 
sponsor must pay applicable user fees
. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application 
does not begin until the last section 
of the application 
is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Second, a 
product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, e
ither alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one o
r more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development
. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product 
 13


sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, the FDA may designate a product for 
priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on 
a case‑ by‑case 
basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment
‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cu
res Act”) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval 
of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies.  A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to tr
eat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical 
needs for such disease or condition.  The benefits of a regenerative advanc
ed therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to 
breakthrough therapies
, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 Accelerated approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further, to verify and describe its clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome.  Post-marketing studies would usually be studies already underway. When required to be conducted, such studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. The applicant shall carry out any such studies with due diligence.
 Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines 
 14


the deficiencies in the submission and may require additional, sometimes substantial, testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may impose post-marketing requirements, which are studies and clinical trials that the sponsor is required to conduct under one or more statutes or regulations, or post-marketing commitments which are studies or clinical trials that the sponsor has agreed to conduct, but that are not required by a statute or regulation.  The FDA may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings and/or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Maintenance 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with or without clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of 
 15


drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug

for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied 
upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug[.]”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA.  An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.  In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.  Three year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five year NCE exclusivity, an award of three year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking 
 16


approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 17


The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act is intended to improve the FDA and applicant accountability for the agreed-upon pediatric studies by creating a new mechanism for funding pediatric studies that sponsors or holders of approved applications declined to conduct voluntarily.  Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity, which is discussed below. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection that cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 In some oncology indications, where pediatric studies are impossible or highly impractical (because, for example, the number of pediatric patients is so small or geographically dispersed), it may be possible to request a waiver.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Pharmaceutical companies developing an orphan drug to treat an uncommon disease may be eligible for the research tax credit for qualified research expenses or the orphan drug tax credit for development costs attributable to qualified clinical testing incurred in developing the drug.
 Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements under the Pediatric Research Equity Act do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
The 21st Century Cures Act
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law.  The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, sp
ur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery 
and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs.  It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects.  The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health.  The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research.  It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research.  Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 18


With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies.  To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union (EU)
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directives, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted.  If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU member states, the competent authorities in each of these EU member states must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial.  Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.    In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU member states without the need for any national implementing legislation, and (subject to certain exceptions) became applicable in May 2016 to clinical trial applications submitted as of that time.  Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU member state through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU member state or in more than one EU member state.  The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.  
Marketing Authorization
 To obtain marketing approval of a drug under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, using the appropriate registration procedure. 
 The “centralized procedure” provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. The working definition includes all malignant and borderline malignant neoplasms, following the current International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, including primary or secondary malignant neoplasms, carcinoma in situ, and neoplasms classified as uncertain whether benign or malignant.  Medicinal products for cancer treatment include antineoplastic agents (including modulators and enhancers of antineoplastic activity) and adjuvant treatments.  For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is responsible for preparing EMA’s opinions on all questions concerning medicines for human use, in accordance with European regulation.  In the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of medicines for which an EU-wide marketing authorization is sought.  The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 19


The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization.
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the EU 
 In the EU, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom (U.K.) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. The U.K. Prime Minister has stated that notice of withdrawal will be given by the end of March 2017. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directive
s and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K.  It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
 In the EU pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 20


Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law will require manufacturers of drugs, devices, drugs and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of ph
armaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs 
and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the 
Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential 
drug candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unabl
e to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers 
up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will
 remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken
. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 The new Administration and Congress have expressed interest in repealing and replacing certain provisions of the ACA.  In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA.
  The Budget Resolution is not a law, however. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities 
under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  
 In March 2017, the House considered new legislation to repeal and replace the ACA.  That bill, however, was withdrawn when it became clear that there were not enough votes to pass it.  While the President and congressional leaders have indicated that they plan to address other legislative initiatives, th
ey may continue to have interest in repealing certain ACA provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility.  As a result, while it remains unclear whether new legislation will be adopted to repeal and replace the ACA, it is possible that some of the ACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could be repealed along with ACA coverage expansion provisions if new legislation is enacted.

 In March 2017, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 58%, affecting 11 of our current employees.  We anticipate that this workforce reduction will be completed in the second quarter of 2017.  As of March 30, 2017, we had 19 full-time employees, including a total of 8 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our workforce, 15 employees are engaged in research and development. None of our employees is represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Upon completion of our March 2017 workforce reduction, we will have no more than eight full-time employees.
