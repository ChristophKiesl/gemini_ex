 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are an international offshore drilling contractor committed to exceeding client expectations by delivering the safest, most efficient and reliable deepwater drilling services in the industry. We believe we own and operate the only deepwater fleet comprised solely of sixth and seventh generation high-specification drillships, and that our current fleet of seven drillships offers premium technical capabilities to our clients. The term “high-specification,” as used in the floating rig drilling industry to denote a particular segment of the market, can vary and continues to evolve with technological improvements. We generally consider high-specification requirements to include non-harsh environment drillships delivered in or after 2005 and capable of drilling in water depths of 10,000 feet or more.
 Pacific Drilling S.A. was formed on March 11, 2011, as a Luxembourg public limited liability company (société anonyme) under the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. Our principal executive offices are located at 8-10, Avenue de la Gare, L-1610 Luxembourg and our telephone number is +352 27 85 81 35. Our registered agent in Luxembourg is Centralis S.A, which is located at 8-10, Avenue de la Gare, L-1610 Luxembourg.  The operational headquarters of our Company is located at 11700 Katy Freeway, Suite 175, Houston Texas 77079.  Our telephone number at this address is 713-334-6662.
 Our common shares were listed on the Norwegian OTC List from April 2011 to October 2016 and on the NYSE from November 11, 2011 to September 12, 2017. From September 13, 2017 to December 17, 2018, our common shares were traded on the over-the-counter market under the ticker symbols “PACDQ” and “PACDD,” respectively. Our common shares were relisted on the NYSE on December 18, 2018 and currently trade under the symbol “PACD.”

 Emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings 
 By order entered on November 2, 2018 (the “Confirmation Order”), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) confirmed the Company’s Modified Fourth Amended Joint Plan of  Reorganization, dated October 31, 2018 (the “Plan of Reorganization”) that had been filed with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the filing by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Initial Debtors”) of petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) on November 12, 2017 (the “Petition Date”) with the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). During the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Initial Debtors continued to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession.  On November 19, 2018 (the “Plan Effective Date”), the Company and the Initial Debtors other than the Zonda Debtors (defined below) (the “Debtors”) emerged from bankruptcy after successfully completing their reorganization pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. 
 Prior to our emergence from bankruptcy on November 19, 2018, we had approximately $3.0 billion principal amount of pre-petition indebtedness consisting of amounts outstanding under a 2013 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2013 Revolving Credit Facility”), a senior secured credit facility (the “SSCF”), a 2018 senior secured institutional term loan facility (the “Term Loan B,”), 2017 senior secured notes (the “2017 Notes”) and 2020 senior secured notes (the “2020 Notes”), plus an additional $50 million in post-petition debtor-in-possession financing.  One shareholder, Quantum Pacific Gibraltar Ltd (“QP”), owned approximately 70.3% of our outstanding common shares.
 Reorganization Transactions Relating to Capital Structure
 Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, we raised approximately $1.5 billion in new capital, before expenses, consisting of approximately $1.0 billion raised through issuance of our 8.375% First Lien Notes due 2023 (the “First Lien Notes”) and 11.0%/12.0% Second Lien PIK Notes due 2024 (the “Second Lien PIK Notes” and, together with the First Lien Notes, the “Notes”), and $500.0 million raised through the issuance of new common shares pursuant to a private placement to QP and a separate equity rights offering. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay all of our pre-petition indebtedness that was not equitized pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, to repay the post-petition debtor-in-possession financing, and to pay certain fees and expenses.
 More specifically, upon emergence of the Company from bankruptcy on November 19, 2018 in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization:

· | The Company’s pre-petition 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, SSCF and post-petition debtor-in-possession financing were repaid in full;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Holders of the Company’s pre-petition Term Loan B, 2017 Notes and 2020 Notes received an aggregate of 24,416,442 common shares (or, approximately 32.6% of the outstanding shares) in exchange for their claims;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company issued an aggregate of 44,174,136 common shares (or, approximately 58.9% of the outstanding shares) to holders of the Term Loan B, 2017 Notes and 2020 Notes who subscribed in the Company’s $460.0 million equity rights offering;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company issued 3,841,229 common shares (or, approximately 5.1% of the outstanding shares) to QP in a $40.0 million private placement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company issued 2,566,056 common shares (or approximately 3.4% of the outstanding shares) to members of an ad hoc group of holders of the Term Loan B, 2017 Notes and 2020 Notes (the “Ad Hoc Group”) in payment of their fee for backstopping the equity rights offering;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company issued approximately 7.5 million common shares to Pacific Drilling Administrator Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that serves as administrator of the Company’s 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Stock Plan”), adopted by the Board, and which shares were reserved for issuance under the 2018 Stock Plan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Existing holders of the Company’s common shares received no recovery and were diluted by the issuances of common shares under the Plan of Reorganization such that they held in the aggregate approximately 0.003% of the Company’s common shares outstanding upon emergence from bankruptcy; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5
 


· | The undisputed claims of other unsecured creditors such as clients, employees and vendors, were paid in full in the ordinary course of business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Prior to the issuance of the shares described above, the Company effected a 1-for-10,000 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split and the issuances of common shares described above, the Company had issued and outstanding on the Plan Effective Date approximately 75.0 million common shares, and approximately 7.5 million shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2018 Stock Plan.
 Our emergence from bankruptcy resulted in a change of control of the Company.
     In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, on September 26, 2018 bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries of the Company issued, and on November 19, 2018 such subsidiaries merged with the Company and the Company assumed (the “Notes Assumption”):

· | $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes secured by first-priority liens on substantially all assets of the Debtors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | $273.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien PIK Notes secured by second-priority liens on substantially all assets of the Debtors. Approximately $23.6 million aggregate principal amount was issued as a commitment fee to the Ad Hoc Group for their agreement to backstop the issuance of the Second Lien PIK Notes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Concurrent with the Notes Assumption, all of the Company’s subsidiaries other than the Zonda Debtors (defined below), certain immaterial subsidiaries and Pacific International Drilling West Africa Limited (“PIDWAL,” a Nigerian limited liability company indirectly 49% owned by the Company) guaranteed on a senior secured basis the First Lien Notes and Second Lien PIK Notes. If the Zonda Debtors are successful in their appeal of the Tribunal’s decision in the arbitration discussed below, it is expected that the Zonda Debtors will guarantee the First Lien Notes and Second Lien PIK Notes upon their emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to the Zonda Plan (defined below). If the Zonda Debtors are unsuccessful in the appeal, the Company expects that the Zonda Debtors will be liquidated in accordance with the terms of the Zonda Plan and the Zonda Debtors would not guarantee the First Lien Notes and Second Lien PIK Notes.
 Other Reorganization Transactions
 Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the following additional principal transactions and events occurred on the Plan Effective Date: 

· | Amendment of Articles of Association. The Company’s Articles of Association (our “Articles”) were amended to, among other things, reflect the new capital structure and establish a classified board of four Class A directors and three Class B directors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Governance Agreement. The Company entered into a Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) with certain holders of its shares, which provides for, among other things, the rights of such shareholders to nominate the three Class B directors, board observer rights of the parties, as well as an agreement to increase the Company’s share capital at the request of certain parties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Resignation of Directors and Election of New Directors. All of the Company’s directors prior to our emergence from bankruptcy resigned from our board of directors and upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we had an entirely new board of directors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Appointment of Chief Executive Officer. Bernie G. Wolford Jr. was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Registration Rights Agreement. The Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain holders of its shares, which grants such holders certain registration rights with respect to our common shares.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Zonda Arbitration

 
  6
 

 The Company’s two subsidiaries involved in the arbitration with Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (“SHI”) related to the drillship known as the Pacific Zonda – Pacific Drilling VIII Limited (“PDVIII”) and Pacific Drilling Services, Inc. (“PDSI” and, together with PDVIII, the “Zonda Debtors”) – are not Debtors under the Plan of Reorganization and filed a separate plan of reorganization that was confirmed by order of the Bankruptcy Court on January 30, 2019 (the “Zonda Plan”). On the date the Zonda Plan was confirmed, the Zonda Debtors had $4.6 million in cash and no other material assets after accounting for post-petition administrative expenses (other than the value of their claims against SHI) for SHI to recover against on account of its claims. On January 15, 2020, an arbitration tribunal in London, England (the “Tribunal”) awarded SHI approximately $320 million with respect to its claims against the Zonda Debtors. The award does not include approximately $100 million in interest and costs sought by SHI, on which the Tribunal reserved making a decision to a later date. As a result of the Tribunal’s decision, the Company recognized a loss of $220.2 million within loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily related to the elimination of a receivable related to the Zonda Debtors’ claim on the balance sheet.  
 On February 11, 2020, the Zonda Debtors filed an application with the High Court in London seeking permission to appeal the Tribunal’s award. There can be no assurance that the Zonda Debtors will receive permission to appeal, or that if such permission is granted, that any such appeal will be successful. If the Zonda Debtors are successful in reversing the Tribunal’s decision, they will emerge from their separate bankruptcy proceedings. If the Zonda Debtors are unsuccessful in the appeal, the Company expects that the Zonda Debtors will be liquidated in accordance with the terms of the Zonda Plan. For additional information, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”
 Our Business Strategies
 Our principal business objective is to exceed client expectations by delivering the safest, most efficient and reliable deepwater drilling services in the industry. Our operating strategy is designed to enable us to provide high quality, safe and cost-competitive services and to maintain and deploy our assets to position us to benefit from an expected increase in demand for deepwater offshore drilling and increase our cash flow and profits. Specifically, we expect to achieve our business objectives through the following strategies: 
· | Enhanced focus on safety and operational excellence targeting key markets. Excelling in safety and operational performance is a key factor for success in our industry. Our management team is focused on providing quality drilling services for our clients by minimizing downtime and maximizing rig operational efficiency. We believe that we have developed a competitive advantage through our exceptional operating performance and plan to target a presence in key high-specification, deepwater drilling geographies, including West Africa, Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia. We have built a strong team of experienced professionals that have expertise in diverse areas, such as regulatory and operational affairs, in these key offshore areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continued development of strategic relationships with high-quality clients. Improvement of our future revenue is dependent upon major international and national oil companies as well as independent exploration and production companies increasing their exploration and development programs. Our existing and potential clients tend to take long-term approaches to the development of their projects, and we believe that our strong operational performance and efficient cost management will make us a preferred long-term partner. We plan to continue to manage our drillships in such a way as to enable us to nimbly and cost-effectively exploit improvements in the market for deepwater drilling services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Efficiently manage costs while maintaining optionality and marketability. With a cost-competitive fleet, we believe we will continue to benefit as the market improves. We have a well-positioned and well-maintained fleet that we believe is at the low end of the cost of supply curve. We have implemented company-wide cost-savings initiatives to reduce our operating, maintenance and supply chain management expenses while effectively maintaining our ability to restart idle rigs.

 Contract Backlog
 Our contract backlog includes firm commitments only, which are represented by signed drilling contracts. As of March 6, 2020, our contract backlog was approximately $189.2 million and was attributable to revenues we expect to generate on (i) the Pacific Sharav under the drilling contract with a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) and under the drilling contract with a subsidiary of Murphy Oil Corporation (“Murphy”), (ii) the Pacific Santa Ana under the drilling contract with PC Mauritania 1 Pty Ltd. (“Petronas”), (iii) the Pacific Bora under the drilling contract with Eni Oman B.V., a subsidiary of Eni S.p.A. (“Eni”) and (iv) the Pacific Khamsin under the drilling contract with a subsidiary of Equinor ASA (“Equinor”). We calculate our contract backlog by multiplying the contractual dayrate by the number of days committed under the contracts (excluding options to extend), assuming full utilization, and also including mobilization fees, upgrade reimbursements and other revenue sources, such as the standby rate during upgrades, as stipulated in the applicable contracts. For a well-by-well contract, we calculate the contract backlog by estimating the expected number of remaining days to drill the firm wells committed.
 The actual amounts of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from our contract backlog and periods shown in the table below due to various factors, including unplanned downtime and maintenance projects and other factors. Our contracts generally provide for termination at the election of the client with an “early termination payment” to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances, such as destruction of a drilling rig or sustained unacceptable performance by us, an early termination payment is not required to be paid. Accordingly, the actual amount of revenues earned may be substantially lower than the backlog reported.
 The following table sets forth certain contracting information regarding our fleet as of March 6, 2020.

 | Contracted | | Contract | 
Rig | Location | Client | Commencement | Expected Contract Duration 
Pacific Sharav | U.S. Gulf of Mexico | Chevron | September 2019 | Extension for three wells through May 2020. 
 | Mexico | Murphy | Q4 2020 | Two firm wells and one option well. 
Pacific Khamsin | U.S. Gulf of Mexico | Equinor/Total | December 2019 | Contract to operate in U.S. Gulf of Mexico for three firm wells through November 2020, with one option well. Assigned to Total for second firm well. 
Pacific Santa Ana | Mauritania | Petronas | December 2019 | Contract to perform integrated services for a plug and abandonment project estimated at 360 days. 
 | Senegal/Mauritania | Total | — | Two one-well options whose commencement would follow contract with Petronas. 
Pacific Bora | Oman | Eni | February 2020 | Contract for one firm well with an estimated duration of approximately 30 days and includes a $5 million mobilization fee and a $5 million demobilization fee. The contract provides for one option well.

Drilling Contracts
 We typically provide drilling services on a “dayrate” contract basis. Under dayrate contracts, the drilling contractor provides a drilling rig and rig crews and charges the client a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well. In certain contracts, we may also provide additional third-party services integrated into the standard drilling rig contract, which results in additional revenue, costs and associated downtime risk. The client bears substantially all of the ancillary costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well. In addition, dayrate contracts sometimes provide for a lump sum amount for mobilizing the rig to the well location and a reduced dayrate when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by 

 
  8
 
equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the contractor’s control. A dayrate drilling contract generally covers either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or has a stated term. These contracts may generally be terminated by the client in the event the drilling unit is damaged, destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment, “force majeure” events beyond the control of either party or upon the occurrence of other specified conditions. In addition, drilling contracts with certain clients may be cancelable, without cause, with little or no prior notice. Some longer-term contracts are subject to early termination payments. In some instances, the dayrate contract term may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time at fixed or mutually agreed terms, including dayrates.
 Competition
 The contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller, locally owned companies.
 Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability, capabilities, age and each contractor’s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Operators also may consider crew experience, technical and engineering support, rig location and efficiency, as well as long-term relationships with major international oil companies and national oil companies.
 We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive in the near and intermediate term. We believe that our fleet of high-specification drillships provides us with a competitive advantage over many competitors with older fleets, as high-specification drilling units are generally better suited to meet the requirements of clients for drilling in deepwater, complex geological formations with challenging well profiles. However, certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, which may enable them to better withstand periods of low utilization and compete more effectively on the basis of price.
 Seasonality
 In general, seasonal factors do not have a significant direct effect on our business.
 Insurance
 The contract drilling industry is subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including blowouts and well fires, which could cause personal injury, suspend drilling operations, or seriously damage or destroy the equipment involved. Offshore drilling operations are also subject to hazards particular to marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. While we maintain insurance to protect our drillships in the areas in which we operate, certain political risks and other environmental risks are not fully insurable. We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for hull and machinery, marine liabilities, third party liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, general liability, vessel pollution and other coverages.
 Our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and our insurance coverage may not adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry and adequate for our business. However, there are risks that such insurance will not adequately protect us against and insurance may not be available to cover all of the liability from all of the consequences and hazards we may encounter in our operations.
 Governmental Regulation/Environmental Issues
 Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state, local and foreign or international laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.

 
  9
 

 United States
 In the United States, we must comply with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act) and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, as each has been amended from time to time. Numerous governmental agencies, which in the United States include, among others, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, issue regulations to implement and enforce environmental laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. We could be subject to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup obligations, legal damages for pollution or personal injury or injunctive relief for violations of or liabilities under these laws. Moreover, it is possible that changes in these environmental laws and regulations or any enforcement policies that impose additional or more restrictive requirements or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nigeria
 As an independent drilling contractor operating in Nigeria, we are subject to Petroleum (Drilling and Production) Amendment Regulations 1988 (the “Regulations”) which require us to be accredited with the Department of Petroleum Resources (the “DPR”). The Guidelines and Application Form for Oil & Gas Industry Service Permit issued by the DPR (the “DPR Guidelines”) require that we are accredited and issued with a permit by the DPR (the “DPR Permit”) in order to carry out the services in the industry. We have received and must annually renew the DPR Permit in accordance with the DPR Guidelines. In addition to the DPR Permit, under the Local Content Act (as defined below), we are required to be registered with the Joint Qualification System (“JQS”). The Nigerian Petroleum Exchange (“NIPEX”) administers the JQS. NIPEX is required to pre-qualify companies and categorize them into its database as a prerequisite for any company intending to offer services in the industry and forms the basis for an invitation to tender for contracts. Under the Regulations we are also required to obtain a valid license prior to operating a drilling rig (a “Drilling Rig Permit”). A Drilling Rig Permit is granted by the Minister of Petroleum Resources (“Minister”) or any other public officer in the Ministry authorized by the Minister in writing in that regard.
 Our operations are also subject to the provisions of the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry of Nigeria which establish a uniform monitoring and control program in relation to discharges arising from oil exploration and development in Nigeria.
 The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act, 2010 (the “Local Content Act”) was enacted to provide for the development, implementation and monitoring of Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry and places emphasis on the promotion of Nigerian content among companies bidding for contracts in the oil and gas industry. It also provides for majority Nigerian equity distribution of the relevant companies. The Local Content Act requires contractors within the oil and gas industry to comply with the minimum Nigerian Content (as defined in the Local Content Act) specified for each particular project item, service or product specification as set out in Schedule A of the Local Content Act (the “Schedule”). The Schedule provides the parameters and minimum level/percentages to be utilized in determining and measuring Nigerian Content in the composite human, material resources and services applied by operators and contractors in any project in the industry. The most relevant categories under the Schedule for us fall under the headings of “Well and Drilling Services/Petroleum Technology” and “Exploration, Subsurface, Petroleum Engineering and Seismic.” The activities listed therein include: “Producing Drilling Services” and “Drilling Rigs Semi-submersibles/Jack ups/others” which both apply to us. For offshore drilling services within the above referenced categories, the minimum required Nigerian Content for the provision of such services provided in the Schedule is stated in terms of “Manhours” (i.e., human resources) and is 85% and 55%, respectively. In the event there is insufficient Nigerian capacity to satisfy the minimum percentages prescribed in the Schedule, the Minister may authorize the continued importation of the relevant item or personnel for a maximum period of three years from the commencement of the Local Content Act. This implies that the Minister may grant a waiver for up to a maximum of three years from the commencement of the Local Content Act (i.e., by 2013). Subject to any amendments to the Local Content Act, and/or guidelines issued by the Nigerian Content Monitoring Board clarifying certain provisions of the Local Content Act, all entities must comply with the provisions of the Local Content Act.

 
  10
 

 We are required to submit a proposed Nigerian Content Execution Plan and will provide a Monthly Nigerian Content Report, a document that details the amount of Nigerian Content utilized in the performance of the contract.
 In addition to the above Nigerian Content requirements, Nigerian subsidiaries of international companies are required to demonstrate that a minimum of 50% of the equipment deployed for execution of works is owned by the Nigerian subsidiary.
 The Local Content Act also requires that our Nigerian subsidiary place 100% of its insurance policies with local Nigerian insurers and that local capacity must have been exhausted before any insurance risk is placed with foreign insurers and any offshore placement of insurance must be with prior approval of the National Insurance Commission.
 Ghana
 We have formed a joint venture company in Ghana for the purpose of bidding on projects in Ghana. As an independent drilling contractor operating in the upstream petroleum sector in Ghana, we must comply with, among others, the Petroleum (Exploration & Production) Act, 2016 (Act 919)(“the Act”); Petroleum Exploration and Production – HSE Regulations 2017 (L.I 2258); Petroleum Exploration And Production - Data Management Regulations, 2017 (L.I 2257); Petroleum Exploration And Production (General) Regulations, 2018 (L.I 2359); Petroleum (Local Content and Local Participation) Regulations, 2013 (L.I 2204); Petroleum Commission: Guidelines for the Formation of Joint Venture Companies in the Upstream Petroleum Industry of Ghana (March 2016) (“JV Guidelines”); Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1994 (Act 490); and the Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1999 (L.I 1652), as each has been amended from time to time. 
 The Petroleum (Exploration & Production) Act, 2016 (Act 919), L.I 2204 and the JV Guidelines require us to incorporate in Ghana and to form a joint venture with an Indigenous Ghanaian Company (IGC), in which the IGC must have at least 10% shareholding, in order to provide services in Ghana. Both our incorporated company and the joint venture company must obtain permits to operate from the Petroleum Commission. 
 The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) (Health and Safety and Environment) Regulations, 2017(L.I 2258), prescribes different health and safety precautions that we must comply with.  Furthermore, the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) (Data Management) Regulations, 2017(L.I 2257) provide that we are required to report and manage all petroleum data obtained from our activities. 
 The Petroleum (Local Content and Local Participation) Regulations, 2013 (L.I 2204) was enacted to promote the maximization of value addition and job creation using local expertise, goods and services, businesses and financing in the petroleum industry value chain and their retention in country.  The law requires minimum thresholds for the procurement of local goods and services where first consideration must be given to qualified Ghanaians.
 Before engaging in petroleum activities, we are required to submit a Local Content Plan for approval by the Commission. The Local Content plan must include: (i) an Employment and Training Sub-Plan; (ii) a Research and Development Sub-Plan; (iii) a Technology Transfer Sub-Plan; (iv) a Legal Services Sub-Plan; and (v) a Financial Services Sub-Plan.  It is an offence under L.I 2204 to submit a false plan.
 L.I2204 also requires that insurable risks relating to petroleum activity in the country shall be insured through an indigenous brokerage firm or where applicable, a reinsurance broker, and that we retain the services of a Ghanaian legal practitioner or a firm of Ghanaian legal practitioners whose principal office is located in Ghana.  We are further required to retain the services of a Ghanaian financial institution or organization and maintain a bank account with an indigenous Ghanaian bank.
 Environment, Health, Safety and Quality
 Pacific Drilling recognizes that, as a leading offshore drilling contractor, we must be a responsible corporate steward with a strong commitment to sustainability. This commitment is fundamental to the way that we conduct business and is critical to our future success. 

 
  11
 

 Our business requires us to operate in remote and sensitive marine environments. On our drillships, our employees conduct their work in challenging and complex industrial conditions. Our corporate Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy highlights the importance of HSE to our overall success and sets expectations for all personnel to take personal responsibility for the safety of themselves, others and the environment. Pacific Drilling is committed to creating an incident free work place for all our employees, contractors, suppliers and clients. All personnel working for, or on behalf of, Pacific Drilling are empowered to stop their own work, or the work performed by co-workers, client representatives, contractors or management, if it causes concern related to health, safety, security or environmental pollution. We provide comprehensive training programs to ensure our people understand our safety policies and processes and are prepared to perform their work functions safely, including focused programs for short service personnel as they develop their familiarity with our work environment. All personnel are expected to plan work in a manner that encourages active involvement in hazard identification and risk assessment, including the implementation of appropriate risk reduction measures. We implement programs to involve all personnel in the monitoring of our work activities and proactively report and address at-risk behaviors and substandard conditions. If any HSE events do occur, we are prepared to respond in case of emergency, and we investigate all incidents with an aim to correct errors and share learnings. We track our HSE performance and include HSE-focused metrics in our annual company goals to drive ongoing improvement.
 Just as we are committed to sustainability in our current operations, we are also committed to longer-term efforts to minimize our environmental impact. In 2019, we initiated an accredited third-party study to analyze the current carbon footprint of our drilling operations worldwide.  From this study we will establish a baseline to evaluate areas for improvement and set goals for future initiatives to increase our carbon efficiency and minimize our environmental impact.
 At Pacific Drilling, we believe that the methods we employ to achieve our results are as important as the results themselves. We believe that our aim to exceed client expectations by delivering the safest, most efficient and reliable deepwater drilling services in the industry is best accomplished through stringent ethical requirements and the highest standards of corporate governance. Our Global Code of Conduct is designed to support the Company's core values and allow each of us to live up to those values as we work. We deliberately set high expectations for our corporate and personal behavior that apply to all employees—regardless of rank—and any independent contractors, agents, or consultants who are working for or on behalf of the Company, no matter where in the world they may be located.
 Organizational Structure and Joint Venture
 We have 40 subsidiaries organized under the laws of various jurisdictions.
