Item 1.    Business.
Introduction
Newcourt Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated on February 25, 2021 as a Cayman Islands company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the initial public offering and searching for a potential target for the initial business combination.
Initial Public Offering
On October 22, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 25,000,000 units, including 3,000,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one public share, and one-half public warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one public share for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate 1,140,000 units to our sponsor, Cantor and CCM at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $11,400,000.
A total of $255,000,000, comprised of the proceeds from the initial public offering, the underwriters’ exercise of partial over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement units was placed in the trust account with Continental acting as trustee.
Extensions
On January 6, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination for an initial three (3) months from January 22, 2023 to April 22, 2023 and up to three (3) times for an additional one (1) month each time from April 22, 2023 to July 22, 2023 (which is 21 months from the closing of our IPO). If the Company’s initial business combination is not consummated by July 22, 2023 (or earlier, if the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination is not extended in full), then the Company’s existence will terminate, and the Company will distribute amounts in the Trust Account as provided in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In connection with the First Extension Amendment, Newcourt shareholders holding 23,497,468 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately $247 million (approximately $10.35 per public share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. In connection with the Extension Amendment, on July 7, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note (the “Extension Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,000,000 (the “Extension Funds”) to the sponsor, pursuant to which the sponsor agreed to provide the Company with installments of the Extension Funds, to be deposited into the Trust Account for each month in which the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination is extended.
Proposed Psyence Business Combination
Overview
On January 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”) with the sponsor, Psyence Group Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Psyence”), and Psyence Biomed Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada (“Psyence Biomed”).
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the Effective Time (as defined below), (a) a to-be-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary of Psyence Biomed domiciled in the Cayman Islands (the “Merger 

7



Sub”) will be merged with and into Newcourt (the “Merger”), with Newcourt surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Psyence Biomed (the “Combined Company”).
As consideration for the Merger, as of the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (i) each Class B ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Newcourt (the “Newcourt Class B Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and upon the terms set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive one common share of Psyence Biomed (each, a “Psyence Biomed Common Share”) (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), and (ii) each Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Newcourt (the “Newcourt Class A Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the completion and payment of any redemptions of Newcourt Class A Stock (the “Redemption”)), other than shares owned by Newcourt, Merger Sub, Psyence Biomed or any of their respective subsidiaries, by virtue of the Merger and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The aggregate number of Psyence Biomed Common Shares into which the Newcourt Class A Stock and Newcourt Class B Stock are converted into is the merger consideration (the “Merger Consideration”).
Before or upon the Closing, Psyence Biomed intends to transfer the shares of Good Psyence (Pty) Ltd (RF) (South Africa), Psyence Jamaica Ltd (Jamaica), Psyence Therapeutics Corp. (Ontario, Canada), Mind Health (Pty) Ltd (Lesotho), Psyence South Africa (Pty) Ltd (South Africa), and Pure Psyence Corp. (Canada) to an entity of the Psyence’s choice.
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Transaction”), Newcourt and Psyence Biomed also intend to enter into Subscription Agreements with certain investors, prior to the consummation of the Transaction (the “Closing”), to provide financing to Newcourt, Psyence Biomed or the Combined Company (the “PIPE Investment”).
Immediately prior to the consummation of the PIPE Investment, Psyence Biomed will effect a stock split, under which each Psyence Biomed Common Share that is issued and outstanding as of such time shall be split into a number of Psyence Biomed Common Shares determined by multiplying each such Psyence Biomed Common Share by a split factor, which is the quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Psyence Biomed Value by $10.00. The “Per Share Psyence Biomed Value” is the quotient obtained by dividing $50,000,000 by the total number of issued and outstanding Psyence Biomed Common Shares immediately prior to the stock split.
Representations and Warranties
The Business Combination Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties made by the parties as of the date of the Business Combination Agreement or other specified dates. Certain of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined), as well as information provided in the disclosure schedules to the Business Combination Agreement. As used in the Business Combination Agreement, “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to any specified person or entity, any event, circumstance or state of facts that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material and adverse effect upon (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of such person or entity and, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of such person or entity to perform its respective obligations and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions.
No Survival
The representations and warranties of the parties contained in the Business Combination Agreement terminate as of, and do not survive, the Closing. The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in the Business Combination Agreement do not survive the Closing, except those covenants and agreements to be performed after the Closing, and then only with respect to any breaches occurring on or after the Closing. 

8



Covenants of the Parties
The Business Combination Agreement also contains certain customary covenants by each of the parties during the period between the signing of the Business Combination Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the Business Combination Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Interim Period”), including those relating to: (i) commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing; (ii) the movement of the funds from the Trust Account at Closing; (iii) maintenance of listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”); (iv) confidential information; (v) access to information, including properties, books and records; (vi) notifications of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (vii) reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals; (viii) communications and SEC filings; (ix) expenses; and (x) consummation of the PIPE Investment. Each party also agreed during the Interim Period not to solicit or enter into any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal for an alternative transaction. The Business Combination Agreement also contains certain customary pre-Closing covenants regarding (a) indemnification of directors and officers and the purchase of tail directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; and (b) adoption of an equity incentive plan of the Surviving Company, in addition to pre-Closing covenants regarding (x) the scope of due diligence and (y) the transfer (or under certain circumstances, forfeiture) by the Sponsor of up to 3,000,000 shares of Newcourt Class B Stock held by the Sponsor for reduction of any deferred underwriting fees and certain other uses.
The parties made customary covenants regarding the registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by Newcourt (the “Registration Statement on Form F-4”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to register the Psyence Biomed Common Shares to be issued as Merger Consideration under the Business Combination Agreement. The Registration Statement on Form F-4 also will contain the Newcourt proxy statement to solicit proxies from Newcourt’s shareholders to approve, among other things, (i) the Business Combination Agreement and the Transaction, including the Merger; (ii) the adoption of a new equity incentive plan and issuing certain Psyence Biomed restricted securities thereunder; and (iii) the appointment of the post-Closing board of directors.
The parties agreed that the post-Closing board of directors will consist of five directors designated prior to the Closing, including one director designated by the Sponsor, one independent director (under Nasdaq requirements) mutually designated by Newcourt and Psyence, and the remaining directors designated by Psyence. The parties further agreed each director and officer of Newcourt will resign at the Closing.
Furthermore, at the Closing, the Parties intend to amend and restate the Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”) to apply to securities of Psyence Biomed, and (ii) at or prior to the Closing, Psyence Biomed will amend and restate its existing Memorandum and Articles to effect the Stock Split.
Conditions to Closing
The Business Combination Agreement contains customary conditions to Closing, including the following mutual conditions of the parties (unless waived): (i) no law or order preventing the Transaction; (ii) approval of the shareholders of Newcourt; (iii) if required by the Canadian Stock Exchange Rules, the approval by shareholders of Psyence; (iv) completion of any required stock exchange or regulatory review and receipt of any mutually agreed required regulatory approvals; (v) the Registration Statement on Form F-4 having been declared effective by the SEC; (vi) obtaining all consents required by the Canadian Securities Exchange and applicable Canadian securities laws; and (vii) resignation of the directors and officers of Newcourt.

Unless waived, the obligations of Newcourt to consummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction of the following additional Closing conditions, in addition to the delivery by Psyence of customary certificates and other Closing deliverables: (i) the representations and warranties of Psyence and Psyence Biomed being true and correct as of the date of the Closing, except to the extent made as of a particular date (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); (ii) Psyence Biomed having performed in all material respects its obligations and complied in all material respects with its covenants and agreements under the Business Combination Agreement required to be performed or complied with or by it on or prior to the date of the Closing; (iii) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Psyence or Psyence Biomed since the date of the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) delivery of a duly executed officer’s certificate certifying certain conditions; (v) Psyence and Psyence Biomed shall have executed and delivered a copy of each Ancillary Agreement to which they are a party; (vi) delivery by Psyence Biomed to Newcourt of certain financial statements; and (vii) a fairness opinion shall have been received by Newcourt.
Termination
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including: (i) by mutual written consent of Newcourt and Psyence; (ii) by either Newcourt or Psyence if any applicable law is in effect which makes the consummation of the Transactions illegal or any final, non-appealable order in effect permanently prevents the consummation of the Transactions, unless such order or other action was caused by the breach of such party; (iii) by either Newcourt or Psyence if the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement shall not have occurred on or before July 22, 2023; (iv) by either Newcourt or Psyence in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, if such breach would result in the failure of a condition to Closing (and so long as the terminating party is not also in breach under the Business Combination Agreement); (v) by either Newcourt or Psyence if the shareholders of Newcourt do not approve the Business Combination Agreement and the Transaction at an extraordinary general shareholder meeting held by Newcourt; (vi) by Newcourt if Psyence does not obtain the requisite approvals for the Transaction; (vii) by Psyence within 10 business days of the date of the Business Combination Agreement if it is unsatisfied with its due diligence of Newcourt; (viii) by Psyence if Newcourt has not delivered to Psyence by March 31, 2023 a certified copy of resolutions or written consent of Newcourt’s board of directors unanimously confirming a $50,000,000 valuation of Psyence Biomed made in reliance of a favourable fairness opinion; (ix) by Psyence if by March 31, 2023 the parties are unable to agree on finalized forms of certain ancillary documents; (x) by Psyence if Subscription Agreements for PIPE Investment evidencing indicative commitments for (or funding of) and non-redemption agreements totaling at least $20,000,000 in the aggregate have not been received by February 28, 2023; and (xi) by Psyence or Newcourt if Newcourt’s transaction expenses exceeds $7,000,000.
If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated, all further obligations of the parties under the Business Combination Agreement (except for certain obligations related to communications, fees and expenses, trust account waiver, termination and general provisions) will terminate, and no party to the Business Combination Agreement will have any further liability. Termination shall not relieve any Party from any liability arising out of or incurred as a result of its fraud or its material breach of the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement does not provide for any termination fees.
Trust Account Waiver
Psyence and Psyence Biomed each agreed that they and their affiliates will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in Newcourt’s trust account held for Newcourt’s public shareholders, and agreed not to, and waived any right to, make any claim against the trust account (including any distributions therefrom) other than in connection with the closing of the proposed business combination.
Governing Law
The Business Combination Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and the parties are subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery.
A copy of the Business Combination Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Business Combination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.
The Business Combination Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of such agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and 

10



covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The Business Combination Agreement has been filed with this Report in order to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Newcourt, Psyence, Psyence Biomed or any other party to the Business Combination Agreement. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Business Combination Agreement, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Business Combination Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other terms of the Business Combination Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Business Combination Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Newcourt’s public disclosures.
Related Agreements
Pursuant to or in connection with the Business Combination Agreement, the parties will enter into certain customary agreements (the “Ancillary Agreements”) such as the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, Lock-Up Agreements, Subscription Agreements and Support Agreements by the Sponsor as well as certain shareholders of the Psyence. Shareholders and other interested parties are urged to read such Ancillary Agreements in their entirety when available.
For more information about the Business Combination Agreement and the proposed business combination with Psyence, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 13, 2023. Unless specifically stated, this Report does not give effect to the proposed business combination with Psyence and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed business combination with Psyence. Such risks and effects relating to the business combination with Psyence will be included in a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that we will file with the SEC relating to our business combination with Psyence.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a 

11



majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholders approval, as applicable.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in any operations and we will not engage in any operations until our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.
If we pay for our initial business combination using shares or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
Although our management will continue to assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
Other Acquisition Considerations
Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or placement units following the IPO, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate 

12



opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.
In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts of interest, our board of directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may have a negative view of us since we are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain shareholder approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account in connection therewith.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $242,500,000 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $12,500,000 of deferred underwriting fees, in each case before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most 

13



efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. On January 6, 2023, shareholders holding 23,497,468 public shares exercised their right to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, approximately $247 million (approximately $10.35 per public share) has been removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $15.55 million remains in the Trust Account.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the IPO. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the placement units, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may, although we do not currently intend to, seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans or excess leverage, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
The Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. Our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.
If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an 

14



investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Lack of business diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

15



Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted purchases of our securities
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, we adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.

16



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
Ability to extend the time to complete our initial business combination
We will have until 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may, by resolution of our board of directors if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three additional times, each by an additional one month (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of incorporation and the trust agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as amended, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, we must deposit into the trust account for each additional one-month extension, $82,500 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, up to an aggregate of $247,500. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.
Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is anticipated to be approximately $10.35 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial holders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
On January 6, 2023, shareholders holding 23,497,468 public shares exercised their right to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, approximately $247 million (approximately $10.35 per public share) has been removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $15.55 million remains in the Trust Account. Following redemptions, the Company has 1,502,532 public shares outstanding.

17



Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

18



If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own approximately 81.2% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

19



Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our initial holders, sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares held by them redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in the initial public offering or thereafter through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.
Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

20



The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the general meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until April 22, 2023 (or July 22, 2023, if the date by which the Company must complete an initial business combination is extended in full).
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
On January 6, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination for an initial three (3) months from January 22, 2023 to April 22, 2023 and up to three (3) times for an additional one (1) month each time from April 22, 2023 to July 22, 2023 (which is 21 months from the closing of our IPO). Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 21 months from the closing of the IPO to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination July 22, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 15-month time period.
Our initial holders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 22, 2023 (or July 22, 2023, if the date by which the Company must complete an initial business combination is extended in full). However, if our initial holders, sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 22, 2023 (or July 22, 2023, if the date by which the Company must complete an initial business combination is extended in full).

21



Our initial holders, sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months, if we further extend the time to complete a business combination) from the closing of the IPO or (ii) with respect to the other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.35. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.20 per share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,500,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the placement units, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
If we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/​creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy insolvency court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months, if we further extend the time to complete a business combination) from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months, if we further extend the time to complete a business combination) from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

23



Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to the initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by July 22, 2023, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human capital and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

24



Conflicts of Interest
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.
Indemnity
Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC to reserve for such obligations.
Human Capital Management
As of the effective date of this Report, we have three officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on the status of the proposed business combination with Psyence and, if the proposed business combination with Psyence is not consummated, whether a different target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

25



We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
On October 18, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

NEWCOURT ACQUISITION CORP
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2022
​
Note 1 – Description of Organization and Business OperationsNewcourt Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on February 25, 2021. The Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Business Combination”).The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2022, relates to the Company’s formation and Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income earned on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on October 19, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 22,000,000 units (“Units”) with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered (the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds of $220,000,000, which is discussed in Note 3. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 1,080,000 units (“Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Company’s sponsor, Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and underwriters Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”), and Cohen & Company Capital Markets (“CCM”), generating gross proceeds of $10,800,000, which is described in Note 4.Offering costs for the IPO and the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option amounted to $15,937,545, consisting of $3,787,971 of underwriting fees, $11,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)) and $1,149,574 of other costs. As described in Note 6, the $13,100,000 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the consummation of a Business Combination by April 22, 2023, 18 months from the closing of the IPO or for further period of 3 months by July 22, 2023, 21 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the closing of the sale of 3,000,000 additional Units upon receiving notice of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option (“Over-allotment Units”), generating additional gross proceeds of $30,000,000 and incurring additional offering costs of $2,100,000 in underwriting fees all of which is deferred until completion of the Company’s Business Combination. Simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment, the Company consummated the Private Placement of an additional 60,000 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $600,000.Following the closing of the IPO and exercise of the over-allotment, $255,000,000 ($10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) and will be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.

The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.20 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights with respect to the Company’s warrants.All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company’s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”). In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of Class A ordinary shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Class A ordinary shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. While redemptions cannot cause the Company’s net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001, the Public Shares are redeemable and are classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place.Redemptions of the Company’s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Company’s Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company.

F-7



The Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Shareholders”) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.On January 6, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination for an initial three (3) months from January 22, 2023 to April 22, 2023 and up to three (3) times for an additional one (1) month each time from April 22, 2023 to July 22, 2023 (which is 21 months from the closing of our IPO). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by July 22, 2023, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.The Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to its deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.20 per shares held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $128,678 in its operating bank accounts, $257,725,405 in securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its Ordinary share in connection therewith and working capital deficit of $13,065,500. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $3,551,791 and $2,424 respectively of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations.Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statement. The Company has since completed its IPO at which time capital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working capital purposes. Accordingly, management has since re-evaluated the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and determined that sufficient capital exists to sustain operations for at least one year from the date that the financial statement was issued, and therefore substantial doubt has been alleviated.

In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution described in the financial statements, should the Company be unable to complete a Business Combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If a Business Combination is not consummated by April 22, 2023, 18 months from the closing of the IPO or for further period of 3 months by July 22, 2023, 21 months from the closing of the IPO, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period.Also, in connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU No. 2014-15 management has determined that if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by April 22, 2023, 18 months from the closing of the IPO or for further period of 3 months by July 22, 2023, 21 months from the closing of the IPO, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition as well as the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), which exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Investments Held in Trust AccountAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury securities. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available market information. Interest receivable balance as at December 31, 2022 pertains to interest income on investments held in Trust and will be included in the investment balance when received by the Company. Interest income received is reinvested into the investments held in Trust account.Offering Costs associated with the IPO
Offering costs, including additional underwriting fees associated with the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option, consist principally of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs directly related to the IPO. Offering costs, including those attributable to the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option in full, amounted to $15,937,545, consisting of $3,787,971 of underwriting fees, $11,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)) and $1,149,574 of other costs.Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage and Securities Investor Protection Corporation Insurance coverage limits of $250,000 and $500,000 (including cash of $250,000). At December 31, 2022 the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:Level 1:    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.Level 2:    Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.Level 3:    Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Income Taxes
ASC Topic 740, Income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.The Company’s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company’s major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.The Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States of America. As such, the Company’s tax provision was zero for the period presented. There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman Islands income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible RedemptionThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary share subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Shares of Class A ordinary share subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary share (including Class A ordinary share that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary share is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary share features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 25,000,000 shares of Class A ordinary share subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Class A ordinary share to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary share are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.At December 31, 2022, the Class A ordinary share subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheet is reconciled in the following table:​

​
Net Income per Common ShareThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”). Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Public Warrants (see Note 3) and Private Placement Warrants (see Note 4) to purchase 13,070,000 ordinary share at $11.50 per share were issued on October 22, 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants have been exercised. The 13,070,000 potential shares of Class A ordinary share for outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to purchase the Company’s stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 and period ended December 31, 2021 because they are contingently 

F-11



exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary share is the same as basic net income per ordinary share for the period. The table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share for each class of stock.​

​
Accounting for WarrantsThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the instruments are free standing financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the Company’s own common shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, was conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Management has concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify as derivative warrant liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s statements of operations. The fair value of warrants issued by the Company in connection with the Public Offering and Private Placement has been estimated using Black-Scholes pricing model at each measurement date.Stock Compensation ExpenseIn connection with the Company’s IPO, Founder’s Shares were sold to certain independent directors from among the Sponsor’s pool of Founder’s Shares at the price paid by the Sponsor (par value of $0.0001). Although these Founder’s Shares were purchased by 

F-12



the independent directors for value, under ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” these Founder’s shares may be deemed stock-based compensation.The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, under which stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. The fair value of equity awards has been estimated using a market approach. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred.As of October 6, 2021, the fair value of the 95,000 Founder Shares granted to certain independent directors by the Sponsor was $600,530 or $6.32 per share. The Company used a Monte Carlo Model simulation to arrive at the fair value of the stock compensation. The key assumptions in the option pricing model utilized are assumptions related to expected separation date of Units, anticipated business combination date, purchase price, share-price volatility, expected term, exercise date, risk-free interest rate and present value. The expected volatility as of the IPO closing date was derived based upon similar Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”) warrants and technology exchange funds which with the Company’s stated industry target and terms until the exercise date. The Company’s Founder Shares sold to independent directors (see Note 5) was deemed within the scope of ASC 718 and are subject to a performance condition, namely the occurrence of a Business Combination. Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares transferred is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence, or more specifically when a Business Combination is consummated. Therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 25, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe Company’s management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statement.
Note 3 — Initial Public OfferingPursuant to the IPO, the Company sold 25,000,000 units (including 3,000,000 units as part of the underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option) at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (such Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), and one-half a redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase three quarters of one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).
​
Note 4 — Private PlacementOn October 22, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, the Company consummated the issuance and sale (“Private Placement”) of 1,140,000 Units (the “Placement Units”) in a private placement transaction at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $11,400,000. The Placement Units were purchased by Cantor (187,000 Units), CCM (33,000 Units) and the Sponsor (920,000 Units). Each whole Private Placement Unit will consist of one Placement Share and one-half of a redeemable warrant (“Placement Warrant”). Each whole Placement Warrant will be exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units will be added to the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Placement Units and all underlying securities will be worthless.

Note 5 — Related Party TransactionsFounder Shares
On March 11, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to fund certain obligations of the Company in consideration for 5,912,500 Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company par value $0.0001 (“Class B ordinary shares”) for an aggregate price of $25,000. In September 2021, the Company effected a dividend of approximately 0.017 shares for each Class B ordinary share outstanding, resulting in there being an aggregate of 6,015,000 Founder Shares outstanding. On October 19, 2021, the Company effected a dividend of approximately 0.099 shares for each outstanding Class B ordinary share, resulting in there being an aggregate of 6,611,500 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the Company’s initial Business Combination and are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in Note 6. Holders of Founder Shares may also elect to convert their Class B ordinary shares into an equal number of Class A ordinary shares, subject to adjustment, at any time. The initial shareholders have agreed to forfeit up to 841,500 Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the underwriters. Since the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option only in part, the Sponsor did forfeit 76,500 Founder Shares.The Initial Shareholders will agree, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.Related Party Loans
On March 11, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Proposed Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). On June 21, 2021 the Note was increased to $1,000,000. This loan is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2022, or the expiration of the 45-day over-allotment option. The Company had no borrowings on the Note as of December 31, 2022.In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per warrant. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. As of December 31, 2022, there were no Working Capital Loans outstanding.Support Services
The Company pays an affiliate of the Sponsor a fee of approximately $30,000 per month following the consummation of the IPO for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period February 25, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, $220,000 and $45,000 was incurred respectively. $100,000 and $45,000 remains unpaid as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively and is included on current liabilities in the balance sheet.For the year ended December 31, 2022, an aggregate of $118,425 was paid to an entity related to the Chief Financial Officer for support services.

Note 6 — Commitments and ContingenciesRegistration Rights
The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Units and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any, will be entitled to registration rights (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion of such shares to Class A ordinary shares) pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed on or before the date of the prospectus for the Proposed Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.Underwriting Agreement
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the final prospectus relating to the IPO to purchase up to 3,300,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 22, 2021, the underwriters elected to partially exercise the over-allotment option purchasing 3,000,000 units.The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit net of reimbursements to the Company of $612,029 to pay for outside advisors, or $3,787,971 in the aggregate at the closing of the IPO. The underwriters have agreed to defer the cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per share related to the over-allotment to be paid at Business Combination ($600,000 in the aggregate). In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commissions of $0.50 per unit, or $12,500,000 from the closing of the IPO. The total deferred fee is $13,100,000, consisting of the $12,500,000 deferred portion and the $600,000 cash discount agreed to be deferred until Business Combination. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.



Note 7 — Shareholders’ EquityOrdinary sharesClass A Ordinary shares—The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 1,140,000 (excluding 25,000,000 Class A Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption) Class A Ordinary shares issued and outstanding.Class B Ordinary shares—The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 6,535,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding after giving effect to the forfeiture of 76,500 shares to the Company by the Sponsor for no consideration since the underwriters’ 45-day over-allotment option was not exercised in full.Holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders except as required by law.The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Proposed Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination,the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, approximately 22.74% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion 

F-15



of loans made to the Company). Holders of Founder Shares may also elect to convert their Class B ordinary shares into an equal number of Class A ordinary shares, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time.Preference Shares —The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preference shares with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. For the period presented, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding.Warrants—The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the IPO. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants:●in whole and not in part;●at a price of $0.01 per warrant;●upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption;
● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing at any time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement.The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Proposed Public Offering, except that the Private Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A ordinary shares at a price below their respective exercise prices. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution 

F-16



from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.In addition, if the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors, and in the case of any such issuance to the Initial Shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by them prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates a Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities.




































Note 8 — Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 13,070,000 warrants outstanding (12,500,000 Public Warrants and 570,000 Private Warrants).The following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.​

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 13,070,000 warrants outstanding (12,500,000 Public Warrants and 570,000 Private Warrants).The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes simulation model to value the warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liability is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black-Scholes pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on industry historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2022 and 2021:​

Note 9 — Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available for issuance and determined that other than the items disclosed below, there were no subsequent events that would require adjustment or disclosure:Business Combination Agreement sponsor
On January 9, 2023, Newcourt Acquisition Corp, entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC, Psyence Group Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario, Canada, and Psyence Biomed Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada (“Psyence Biomed”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the Effective Time (as defined below), (a) a to-be-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary of Psyence Biomed domiciled in the Cayman Islands (the “Merger Sub”) will be merged with and into Newcourt (the “Merger”), with Newcourt surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Psyence Biomed (the “Combined Company”). As consideration for the Merger, as of the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (i) each Class B ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Newcourt (the “Newcourt Class B Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and upon the terms set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive one common share of Psyence Biomed (each, a “Psyence Biomed Common Share”) (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), and (ii) each Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, of Newcourt (the “Newcourt Class A Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the completion and payment of any redemptions of Newcourt Class A Stock (the “Redemption”)), other than shares owned by Newcourt, Merger Sub, Psyence Biomed or any of their respective subsidiaries, by virtue of the Merger and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The aggregate number of Psyence Biomed Common Shares into which the Newcourt Class A Stock and Newcourt Class B Stock are converted into is the merger consideration (the “Merger Consideration”). Before or upon the Closing, Psyence Biomed intends to transfer the shares of Good Psyence (Pty) Ltd (RF) (South Africa), Psyence Jamaica Ltd (Jamaica), Psyence Therapeutics Corp. (Ontario, Canada), Mind Health (Pty) Ltd (Lesotho), Psyence South Africa (Pty) Ltd (South Africa), and Pure Psyence Corp. (Canada) to an entity of the Psyence’s choice. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Transaction”), Newcourt and Psyence Biomed also intend to enter into Subscription Agreements with certain investors, prior to the consummation of the Transaction (the “Closing”), to provide financing to Newcourt, Psyence Biomed or the Combined Company (the “PIPE Investment”).Immediately prior to the consummation of the PIPE Investment, Psyence Biomed will effect a stock split, under which each Psyence Biomed Common Share that is issued and outstanding as of such time shall be split into a number of Psyence Biomed Common Shares determined by multiplying each such Psyence Biomed Common Share by a split factor, which is the quotient obtained by dividing the Per Share Psyence Biomed Value by $10.00. The “Per Share Psyence Biomed Value” is the quotient obtained by dividing $50,000,000 by the total number of issued and outstanding Psyence Biomed Common Shares immediately prior to the stock split.Extension of time period 
On January 6, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “EGM”) for the purpose of considering and voting on the Charter Amendment and the Trust Agreement Amendment. The shareholders of the Company approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination for an initial three (3) months from January 22, 2023 to April 22, 2023 and up to three (3) times for an additional one (1) month each time from April 22, 2023 to July 22, 2023 (which is 21 months from the closing of our IPO).Trust Agreement Amendment
At the EGM, the shareholders of the Company also approved the amendment to the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of October 19, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trust Agreement Amendment”). Pursuant to the Trust Agreement Amendment, the Company will deposit into the Company’s trust account (the “Trust Account”), (i) as soon as practicable after the effective date of the Trust Agreement Amendment, for the initial three-month extension, the lesser of (a) $247,500 and (b) $0.165 for each Class A ordinary share outstanding after giving effect to the redemption, 

F-19



and (ii) for each additional one-month extension, the lesser of (a) $82,500 and (b) $0.055 for each Class A ordinary share outstanding after giving effect to the redemption.Redemption of Shares in Trust Account
In connection with the EGM held on January 6, 2023, shareholders holding 23,497,468 ordinary shares (the “public shares”) exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, approximately $247 million (approximately $10.35 per public share) has been removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $15.55 million remains in the Trust Account. Following redemptions, the Company has 1,502,532 public shares outstanding.Issuance of unsecured Promissory note
On January 17, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”), in the amount of up to $1,000,000 to Newcourt SPAC Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The Note bears no interest and the principal balance is payable on the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination (the “Maturity Date”). At the Maturity Date, by providing written notice to the Company, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the Note, up to a maximum of $1,000,000, into securities of the Company.Recent events relating to the disruption in the U.S. banking system
In March 2023, the shut‐down of certain financial institutions raised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. The U.S. government took certain actions to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system. However, there can be no certainty that the actions taken by the U.S. government will be effective in mitigating the effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring public confidence in the U.S. banking system. Additional financial institution failures may occur in the near term that may limit access to short‐term liquidity or have adverse impacts to the economy. Given the uncertainty of the situation, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
