Industry Background
Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements
The markets in which we sell are dynamic and are characterized by a high rate of change. Optical networks – which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables – have experienced strong traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by enterprise and consumer end users, as well as cloud-based services and applications:
•Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models – including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources. In addition, content is increasingly moving to the edge of the network, creating new capacity and traffic demands closer to the user.

•Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.
•Mobile Traffic and Applications. Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the continued proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites.
•Residential Access Applications and Enterprise Applications. In recent years we have seen a shift in bandwidth demands, traffic patterns and computing functions to the edge of networks. This trend has been meaningfully accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to an increase in remote and hybrid working and work from home arrangements. With a higher percentage of data flows concentrating closer to the edge of the network, more capacity and higher bandwidth to home and enterprise locations is required. These shifts could be permanent, and could influence network architectures and require network operators to adapt.
Emerging technologies, services and applications are further impacting or expected to impact network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. These include:
•5G. Fifth-generation wireless broadband (“5G”) technology is enabling meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance, and enabling emerging applications and services that 4G/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures, including through the addition of additional cell sites as part of the network densification efforts that are paving the way for 5G implementation. 
•Fiber Deep and Fiber-Based Access Networks. Similar to 5G, Fiber Deep is a network densification initiative by cable and multiservice operators that seeks to push more digital fiber closer to the end user and to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while at the same time decreasing power, space and operating costs. Wireline service providers are responding to similar trends by pushing fiber to the home and deeper into access networks.
•Internet of Things. As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic (“M2M”) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be 
monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications.
•Ultra-High Definition Video (“UHD”) and Virtual Reality (“VR”) and Augmented Reality (“AR”). UHD video and the advent of immersive technologies like VR, AR and 360° video are likely to place further capacity and capability demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics industries are rapidly advancing these technologies and making them more widely available and affordable to consumers.
•Edge Computing. Immersive cloud services and gaming using AR and VR technologies require a low latency environment to provide the required user experience. We expect network operators to increase the number and capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users, which may affect network topologies and traffic patterns.
•Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). As broad foundational technologies that increase network intelligence and improve automation, ML and AI enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. We believe that adoption of these technologies will continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, and therefore that ML and AI will serve as drivers of further network traffic and solutions innovation.
We believe that increased adoption of these technologies, services, and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures, requiring network operator investment in their metro, access and aggregation networks, as well as their core networks.
Demand for More Programmable and Automated Networks
Network operators continue to invest in the modernization of their businesses, with an objective to create a more digital experience, reduce operational costs and introduce more agility. To achieve this goal, they are adopting next generation infrastructures that combine end-to-end service automation with the deployment of highly programmable infrastructure. We expect network operators will continue to pursue strategies that emphasize one or more of the following:
•Closed Loop Automation. Network operators are seeking to reduce network operating costs and better leverage analytics, automation and control capabilities to automate end-to-end service creation and delivery. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the programmable network infrastructure and software control elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability and to determine the best placement of traffic for optimal service quality and resource utilization. 
•Software-Defined Networking (“SDN”). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation and quickly deliver customized services to end users, by enabling individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, enabling the optimization of traffic paths and the control of data flows through a network.
•Network Function Virtualization (“NFV”). NFV is the separation of network services or capabilities from the physical network assets that traditionally provide these services or capabilities to end users. Network operators are increasingly using solutions like NFV, which enables network functions that traditionally would have run on specialized or dedicated hardware to be provided through software that runs on industry-standard servers and network and storage platforms, in order to reduce their dependence on single-purpose hardware and accelerate the time to market for new revenue-generating services.
We believe that adoption of these strategies, and the related evolution of core, metro and access network infrastructures, will require network operators and their network solutions vendors to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of both physical and virtual network resources, optimized through software. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will drive increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among networking solutions vendors.
Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions
Network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or “consumption models,” in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to purchasing fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor, new consumption models include the procurement or use of: 
•a fully integrated infrastructure solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator’s own software or that of another vendor; 
•integrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or “disaggregated” procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; 
•open source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions;
•open IP network operating systems running on off-the-shelf third-party equipment; and
•system integration services or customer self-integration to reconstitute the disaggregated components.
Some network operators, including certain of our largest customers, are also pursuing the development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as “white box” hardware). This commoditized hardware could be used with in-house developed data path and control software or third-party developed network operating software. Further, a number of network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, typically in a switch or router platform, as an alternative to integrated optical platforms that combine purpose-built routers and optical systems. 
The consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. While the adoption of these approaches has been limited to date, we expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing a premium on a vendor’s ability to provide robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.
Supply Chain Constraints
Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply market for certain raw materials and components, including in particular the semiconductor components used in most of our products, has experienced significant strain in recent periods. These conditions, which became more acute during the second half of fiscal 2021, have been exacerbated in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, and the strong demand environment. These conditions are impacting a wide range of industries, and across the networking industry, participants are experiencing component shortages, longer lead times and increased cost of components. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2022, and may extend into periods thereafter. 
Industry Consolidation
Our industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years among our competitors, customers and suppliers alike. To drive scale and market share gains, and to meet the intense investment capacity required to keep pace with technology innovation, there has been increased acquisition activity among competing vendors of networking solutions. Acquisition activity has also focused on adding complementary technologies, or accessing adjacent network domains or markets that increase addressable markets of networking vendors. Among our customers, there have been significant horizontal and vertical consolidation activities by communications service providers and cable operators, with several such operators acquiring media and content companies. Customer consolidation can increase their purchasing power and has in the past resulted in delays or reductions in network spending due to changes in strategy or leadership, the timing of regulatory approvals and debt burdens associated with such transactions. Further, significant consolidation among component suppliers may reduce the number of independent suppliers and could create supply challenges affecting our pricing or supply volumes. Consolidation activity across our industry can create opportunities and challenges for our business. We expect this trend to continue, and it may have a significant impact on the entire industry, including our competitive landscape.
Product Development & Sustainability
In the face of growing network traffic and service expansion, network operators are looking toward network technology innovation as a means to support their business model, to prepare for a low carbon future and to meet the requirements of their stakeholders. Network operators are increasingly looking to their technology vendor partners, who form part of their value and supply chain, as a key element of their overall sustainability strategy to manage the lifecycle impact of their networks, including their related power consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and other resource and environmental impacts. For innovation leaders capable of advancing a development strategy and product roadmap that addresses the network performance and sustainability outcomes sought by network operators, a market transition to a low carbon future and the ability to offer greener technology offerings present meaningful opportunities for enhanced competitive position and business growth for vendors. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversification and global scale to drive the profitable growth of our business. Key elements of this strategy include:
Extend Innovation Leadership in Core and Optical Networking. We are focused on using our significant research and development investment capacity to push the pace of innovation in our markets and provide leading offerings that leverage our Adaptive Network vision to make our customers’ networks more dynamic through further advances in programmable network platforms, analytics, control and automation. To strengthen our optical leadership, in fiscal 2021 we brought to market our footprint-optimized, lower power consumption WaveLogic 5 Nano (“WL5n”) 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers to address next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. We also introduced innovative intelligent photonics platforms in our 6500 RLS and ELS and are advancing our Converged Packet Optical portfolio for applications in data center interconnection, submarine networks and edge networks. To support our enhanced portfolio and solutions offerings, we intend to grow our attached services business and leverage network transformation with a broader service offering that includes network migration, optimization and multi-vendor network integration.
Invest in Next Generation Metro and Edge Networking Solutions. To expand our addressable markets and capture additional opportunities in metro and edge applications we are making significant investments in our Routing and Switching solutions. We are leveraging our optical expertise to offer new architectural approaches to address Metro and Edge network use cases. Among other things, we are developing Routing and Switching solutions with enhanced IP/Ethernet capabilities, including packet routing, aggregation and switching, 5G cross-haul, Fiber Deep, fiber-based passive optical network (“PON”) access, and edge computing. To advance our strategy, and pursue the opportunity for our Routing and Switching solutions to transform the network edge, including 5G networks and cloud environments, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired from AT&T its Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology. 
Embrace Multiple Consumption Models and Promote Choice. As network operators pursue diverging consumption models, we intend to offer a range of networking solutions across those models to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to promote choice in our markets. We are making our technology available in both integrated systems and pluggable form factors that together address a range of technical and economic requirements of network operators pursuing differing consumption models. Specifically, we are pursuing these two distinct product development paths for our next-generation coherent optical chipset to enable this range of solutions, and, in fiscal 2021 we introduced our WL5n 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers for next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. Separately, through our Optical Microsystems business we are pursuing sales opportunities that leverage our WaveLogic technology in the form of high-performance transceivers/modems – the combination of a Ciena-designed optical chipset and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with other key optical components and sold independently of integrated systems. Consistent with industry practice, we sell our transceiver/modem technology in the form of an optical module or pluggable to a variety of market participants, including other original equipment manufacturers with whom we compete. By addressing multiple consumption models, we seek to secure a larger portion of the world’s optical network wavelengths, expand our addressable market and access new customer verticals and applications. We expect this may require us to continue to broaden our existing product offering beyond traditional hardware systems and to expand our commercial models over time.
Promote Enhanced Software Automation. We seek to improve network layer automation and programmability by advancing our microservices-based domain controller Manage, Control and Plan (“MCP”) software. We are also focused on gaining adoption and expanding application for our Adaptive IP software, leveraging our Service-Aware Operating System (“SAOS”) embedded in our Routing and Switching products. We also seek to promote broader adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, highlighting its ability to transform network operations and management and reduce the need for manual intervention in key operational processes. In so doing, we believe that Blue Planet can help customers with their digital transformations by transitioning legacy networks into “service ready” networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and lifecycle management of new services. To expand our addressable market, we are pursuing opportunities for our Blue Planet Automation Software platform in enterprise-related applications. We are also investing in Blue Planet-related services and seek to use insights from common business, operational and networking challenges to position our Blue Planet solutions as the means by which to achieve the digital network transformation sought by our customers. A key part of our strategy is to grow our software business as a portion of our total business through expanded customer adoption and broader applications, and to gain adoption of recurring and subscription-based models. 
Focus Diversification on High-Growth Applications and Customer Segments. We believe that the continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to continue to grow our business, and to better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. A key part of our strategy is to continue to diversify our solutions offerings, customer base and geographic reach to address fast-growing applications and markets, including those that are adjacent to or complementary with our current addressable market. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with existing customers and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors, particularly in international markets.

Converged Packet Optical. Our Converged Packet Optical portfolio includes a range of products and solutions that use our WaveLogic coherent optical technology and our intelligent photonics solutions and are optimized for the convergence of coherent optical transport, open optical networking, Optical Transport Network (“OTN”) switching and IP routing and switching.
Our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform provides a flexible and scalable dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”) solution that adds capacity to core, regional, metro and submarine networks and enables efficient transport at high transmission speeds. This platform provides leading coherent wavelength capacities, from 100G to 800G, along with a flexible photonic layer and multi-layer control plane capabilities for scale and service differentiation. This platform, which includes several chassis sizes and a comprehensive set of line cards optimized for individual services or applications, can be used throughout the network, from customer premises to access and metropolitan networks, regional and core networks, and submarine cable and satellite communications landing sites. 
Our Waveserver® family of products consists of compact interconnect platforms that allow network operators to scale bandwidth and support high-bandwidth interconnect applications, such as high-speed data transfer, content delivery, virtual machine migration and disaster recovery/backup between data centers. Waveserver is purpose-built to address disaggregated transponder, data center and general space-constrained applications using a small footprint and low power design. With its modern software architecture, open APIs, and common data models, Waveserver is easy to operate and integrate into existing networks and facilitates deployment of on-demand cloud and high-capacity connectivity services.
Our 6500 Reconfigurable Line System (RLS) is a compact, simple-to-deploy, disaggregated intelligent photonic layer line system that improves scalability, reduces footprint, and offers more flexibility and programmability. Its applications include long-haul and metro data center interconnection and general network modernization and simplification. It offers double fiber 
capacity through automated C- and L-band deployments and provides highly dense remote optical add/drop multiplexing and switching features that enable network operators to react to unpredictable traffic requirements by scaling connectivity and capacity.
Our 5400 family of Packet-Optical Platforms consist of multi-terabit reconfigurable switching systems that consolidate the functionality of an add/drop multiplexer and a digital cross-connect into a single, high-capacity intelligent switching system. These products address both core and metro segments of communications networks and support key managed services, including Ethernet/TDM Private Line and IP services. These products provide for optical transport, traffic aggregation at the network edge and switching that are optimized for handoff at the network core.
Our coherent-optimized edge line system, Coherent ELS, is a high-capacity disaggregated line system that is designed to address next-generation access photonic line system requirements, including the transport of coherent wavelengths originating from pluggables, through a compact, hardened form factor designed to accommodate outside plant deployments. With a focus on reducing operational complexity, our Coherent ELS open line system (OLS) uses integrated intelligence and automation to simplify and scale deployments. 
As discussed above, in fiscal 2021 we brought to market our footprint-optimized WL5n 100G-400G coherent pluggable transceivers to address next-generation access, metro, regional and data center interconnect network applications. However, our entrance into the market for high-performance coherent transceiver module and pluggable opportunities remains in the early stages, and revenue has not been significant to date. Sales of our Optical Microsystems products are reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment.
Routing and Switching. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2021, we renamed our “Packet Networking” product line “Routing and Switching.” Our Routing and Switching portfolio includes products and solutions that enable next-generation metro, access and aggregation or “edge” networks, including solutions that allow customers to simplify their network designs while delivering new, revenue-generating services. These products route, aggregate and switch packet-based traffic to support such applications as IP services, Ethernet business services, cell site routing, mobile cross-haul, converged haul and services, Fiber Deep, and consumer/residential access, as well as ongoing network infrastructure scaling. Our Routing and Switching products are based on our Adaptive IP approach, which delivers end-to-end IP-based services in an automated and more simplified manner than traditional IP network designs. Our Routing and Switching products enable operators to achieve improved network cost effectiveness, including reduced costs associated with power and space, as compared to more complex, traditional IP routing.
Our 3900 family of Service Delivery Platforms and our 5000 family of Service Aggregation Platforms support network access and aggregation, respectively, and have been principally deployed to support IP and Ethernet business services and wireless front haul, backhaul and mid-backhaul applications. Our 3900 family of platforms are purpose-built to fit small to large customer sites as well as multi-tenant office and residential buildings and edge office or outside plant applications. They also allow customers to migrate toward software-based networking and services based on NFV. Our 5000 family provides aggregation to fill higher capacity links within both the metro access and aggregation tiers of networks, allowing operators to reduce the number of router assets required in the core and to better implement edge cloud architectures. 
Our 6500 Packet Transport System (“PTS”) combines packet switching, control plane operation and integrated optics. Together with our 3900 platforms, PTS enables our service provider customers to migrate their legacy TDM (SONET/SDH/PDH) services to a scalable, lower operational cost packet solution.
Our 8100 Coherent IP networking platforms combine high capacity IP routing and switching with high capacity coherent optical transport technologies for next-generation metro and edge applications. 
Our Routing and Switching portfolio also includes our 8700 Packetwave Platform, a multi-terabit packet switching platform for high-density metro networks and inter-data center wide area networks. The 8700 combines packet switching and coherent WaveLogic DWDM optical transport technologies for both data center networks and metro networks.
Employed within our Routing and Switching platforms is our SAOS, which provides the software-based IP capabilities to support 5G, IP VPN services, access, PON, converged interconnect network (CIN) architectures, coherent optical transport, and NFV. 
Our Routing and Switching portfolio will also include the Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology that we acquired from AT&T in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Platform Software and Services
Our software offerings also include our Platform Software, which provides domain control management, analytics, data and planning tools to assist customers in managing our Networking Platforms products in their networks, including by creating more efficient operations and more proactive visibility into their networks. Our Platform Software includes:
•Manage, Control and Plan. MCP software provides intelligent network control of our routing, switching and optical solutions, enabling simplification, acceleration and automation of multi-layer network operations. Our suite of MCP applications integrate software control and analytics applications in a unified interface which provides network performance data. Our MCP domain controller provides fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security (“FCAPS”) management for multi-layer networks, in combination with services management and online network planning. MCP simplifies multi-layer lifecycle operations – including equipment commissioning, service provisioning, service assurance and performance monitoring. MCP provides this functionality for Ciena-developed products as well as a number of products developed by other vendors where they form a unified solution. Through our suite of MCP applications and open APIs, MCP software can integrate into network operators’ Operational Support Systems (“OSS”) and business processes, supporting our customers’ journey towards automation of end-to-end operational workflows. 
•Platform Software Services. To complement our Platform Software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include software subscription services, consulting, network migration and integration, installation and upgrade support services, and technical support relating to our Platform Software offerings. These services are focused on enabling our customers to operate their Ciena networks most efficiently, and to modernize their operations.
Our Platform Software offering also includes planning tools and a number of legacy software solutions, including our OneControl unified management system, that support our installed base of network solutions. As we achieve further customer adoption of our MCP software platform, and as we transition features, functionality and customers to that platform, we expect revenue to decline for our legacy Platform Software solutions.
Blue Planet Automation Software and Services 
Our Blue Planet Automation Software is a comprehensive, cloud native, and standards-based software portfolio that enables customers to realize digital transformation through the automation of the services lifecycle. Our Blue Planet applications are open and modular, and can be deployed either individually or in any combination. These applications include:
•Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (MDSO). Network infrastructures are comprised of multiple technology layers and domains – such as the data center, cloud, metro, access and core networks – and it is often complex for network operators to offer end-to-end services in this environment. Blue Planet enables service orchestration across multiple physical and virtual network domains, multiple layers (Optical, Ethernet, IP and Mobile) and multiple hardware and software vendors. 
•Inventory (“BPI”). By integrating or “federating” data from multiple inventory systems and presenting it in a single dynamic view, BPI allows real-time visibility into the topology and status of network and service resources from end to end. Integrating with legacy operation support systems (“OSS”), BPI helps network providers simplify key operational processes such as service fulfillment, network planning and service assurance.
•Route Optimization and Analysis (“ROA”). ROA combines routing, traffic and performance analytics for real-time monitoring of IP services across the cloud. These capabilities enable troubleshooting of latent or transient network problems and modeling to predict the impact of network infrastructure, service and workload changes to build more resilient networks.
•NFV Orchestration (“NFVO”). Blue Planet provides NFV management and orchestration capabilities for creating and managing virtualized network functions and data center resources. NFVO uses an open, vendor-agnostic approach that allows network operators to select and scale those virtual network functions (“VNFs”) they wish to offer to customers.
•Unified Assurance & Analytics (“UAA”). UAA leverages multi-layer/multi-domain assurance and AI-powered analytics to provide insights into the health and performance of network resources and services, ensuring an end-customer quality of experience and availability to meet dynamic service demands.
•Blue Planet Services. To complement our software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include professional services for solution customization and OSS integration, software and solution support services, consulting and design, and technical support relating to our software offerings. These services are focused on enhancing network automation and network analytics, enabling multi-vendor integration and support, and implementing programmable multi-domain next-generation networks.
The Blue Planet Automation Software portfolio when used together allows operators to fulfill services rapidly and to meet end-customer quality-of-experience expectations via an entire services lifecycle approach, thus accelerating network operators towards their vision of self-healing and self-optimizing closed loop automation. Our entrance into the market relating to these software automation capabilities remains in the early stages and, as such, revenue from our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment continues to represent a relatively small portion of our total revenue.

•Delivering on the Adaptive IP approach and extending the IP/routing capabilities and use cases of our Routing and Switching solutions to support mobile network cross-haul, edge cloud, and network densification and virtualization initiatives, such as 5G, Fiber Deep and residential access; 
•Pursuing development to address different consumption models, including our module, pluggable, component, disaggregated IP NOS and VNF development initiatives; 
•Enhancing our Adaptive Network vision through advances in hardware programmability and software-based domain control, automation and analytics through MCP and purpose-built applications; and
•Advancing our software-led transformation strategy and product development for our Blue Planet Automation Software to enable generation OSS transformation and closed loop automation.
Our research and development efforts are also geared toward portfolio optimization and engineering changes intended to drive product and manufacturing cost reductions across our platforms.
We regularly review our existing solutions offerings and prospective development of new components, features or products in order to determine their fit within our portfolio and broader corporate strategy. We also assess the market demand, technology evolution, prospective return on investment and growth opportunities, as well as the costs and resources necessary to develop and support these products. To ensure that our product development investments and solutions offerings are closely aligned with market demand, we continually seek input from customers and promote collaboration among our product development, marketing and sales organizations. In some cases, where we seek to utilize or gain access to complementary or emerging technologies or solutions, we may obtain technology through an acquisition or, alternatively, through initiatives with third parties pursuant to technology licenses, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangements and other strategic technology relationships or investments. In addition, we participate in industry and standards organizations and, where appropriate, incorporate information from these affiliations throughout the product development process.
Customer Engagement
Our Global Customer Engagement organization includes a direct sales presence that is organized geographically around the following markets: (i) the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (“Americas”); (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (iii) Asia Pacific, Japan and India (“APAC”). Within each geographic area, we maintain specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical, or portfolio. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as partner resources, field marketing, services professionals and commercial management personnel, who ensure that we maintain a high-touch, consultative relationship with our customers.
We also maintain a global partner program that includes distributors, resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other third-party distributors who market and sell our products and services. We utilize these third-party channel partners to market and sell our solutions into specific geographies, applications or customer verticals. We believe there are opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand our addressable market, while at the same time reducing the financial and operational risk of entering additional markets. For third parties in our Ciena Partner Network, we maintain a code of conduct that is available on our website and that sets forth our expectations for the high standards of ethical and legally compliant conduct we require of them in supporting our business. 
To support our global customer engagement efforts, we invest in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners.
Operations and Supply Chain Management
Our operations personnel manage the relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.
We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk, changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries, and physical risk, including the impact of climate change in such geographies. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers’ activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our supply chain and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not represent long-term commitments.
We currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.
We continue to focus on a range of initiatives that seek to optimize our operations, improve our resiliency, and drive cost reductions. We seek to balance these goals through our sourcing and supply chain strategy, outsourcing and use of lower cost geographies. Our efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.
We actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our own business and those within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards that aim to ensure working conditions in the electronics industry, or industries in which electronics are a key component, and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to adhere to these same standards. We also publish a Sustainability Report, which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices.
For a discussion of actions taken to manage through the ongoing global supply chain constraints, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Overview - Supply Chain Constraints” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Seasonality
Like other companies in our industry, we experience quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has often resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations.
Competition
Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Huawei, Nokia, Cisco, Juniper Networks and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA and Ribbon Communications. We also compete with a number of companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment or geographic market.
Keeping pace with the market’s demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon component and module technology developed by and procured from third-party providers, including NTT Electronics (“NEL”), Marvell Technology Group (which acquired Inphi) and Cisco (which acquired Acacia Communications). We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors or an alternative consumption model such as “whitebox” technology, or directly in module, pluggable and component sales opportunities.
As we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and traditional IT services vendors. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, Netcracker and Ericsson.
Across our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:
•the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;
•functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;
•price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions; 
•incumbency and strength of existing business relationships;
•technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development;
•time-to-market in delivering products and features;
•company stability and financial health;
•ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;
•flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management; 
•ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;
•operating costs, space requirements and power consumption of network solutions;
•software and network automation capabilities; 
•ability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability; and
•services and support capabilities.
As a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, winning new opportunities can often require that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms or pricing and other onerous contractual commitments. In so doing, our expectation is that we can recover or improve the economics of such relationships over time. However, these terms can adversely affect our results of operations in any period. These terms can also lengthen our revenue recognition or cash collection cycles, add start-up costs to initial sales or deployment of our solutions, require financial commitments or performance bonds, and place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon us.
Our competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by pending international trade and related matters, in particular between the U.S. and China. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and certain affiliates to the “Entity List,” resulting in significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign direct product rule under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations in a manner that significantly expanded its application to Huawei. Separately, the U.S. has taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions have resulted in escalating tensions between the United States and China and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take additional steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. 
We also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as “white box” hardware, particularly where a customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
The success of our business and technology leadership depends significantly on our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2021, we had approximately 2,000 issued patents and more than 500 pending patent applications worldwide.
Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent, or minimize the risks of all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. 
Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. 
Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.
Governmental Regulations
Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union (the “EU”). We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with applicable laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling. Environmental regulation is increasing, particularly outside of the United States, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Our innovation efforts and our environmental sustainability initiatives are closely linked. Our product development efforts focus on allowing network operators to continually “do more with less.” We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our high-performance networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to improve power, space and cooling requirements, and to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design and sourcing, and to assess and improve efficiencies over the life cycle of our products, including packaging and distribution, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We make CDP climate change and water disclosures and are a member of the RBA. We have adopted, and seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt, the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. 
Other Regulations 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy.” 
People and Culture
Our technology solutions are developed, marketed, sold and supported by the talented individuals that make up our 7,241 person global workforce as of October 30, 2021, over 99% of whom were full-time employees. We have a broad base of talent in more than 35 countries, with approximately 59% in the Americas, 33% in APAC, and 8% in EMEA, the majority of whom are in engineering, operations or sales roles.
We understand that our industry and innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their wellbeing, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and adopting progressive human capital management practices constitute a core element of our corporate strategy.
Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy, which includes management’s design and execution of our “people strategy.” This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to execute on our business plans, and that we have programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are well aligned and support these goals. We launched our “People Promise” during fiscal 2020 and honor this promise by promoting a workplace environment where our employees are empowered, feel included and have an opportunity to make a difference through their work at Ciena. In doing so, we seek to cultivate for employees a culture of vibrancy, belonging and happiness, while enabling us to be an attractive 
employer of choice within our markets. Our executive team is actively involved in and sponsors key initiatives and employee resource groups intended to promote this corporate culture. To that end, our people strategy is focused on the following:
•Promote Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity through recruiting outreach, internal networking and resource groups, inclusivity networks, and mentoring programs. As of October 30, 2021, our global workforce was approximately 20.6% female. Our Board of Directors is 30% female and 20% ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2020, in the U.S., where we are headquartered, our approximately 1,700 employee workforce approximately reflected the following ethnicities: 64.6% White, 22.5% Asian, 6.0% Hispanic or Latino, 4.4% Black or African American, 2.0% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.5% additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). We are deeply committed to increasing diversity in our workforce at all levels, and regularly monitor our recruitment process with an aim to improve the diversity of our workforce and candidate pool. Our commitment to providing an inclusive workplace is demonstrated through the introduction of our Conscious Inclusion Workshops which have had 100% participation by our executive leadership and 58% by our managers as of the end of fiscal 2021. In addition, we support multiple active internal networking and resource groups, including our Women@Ciena group, Black & African Heritage group, Pride@Ciena LGBT+ group, and our Ciena Next early in career group, and we launched our LatinX group in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2021, we also ran an eight-month targeted development pilot with our Black & African Heritage group, aimed at strengthening individuals’ sense of belonging and enhancing communication and financial acumen. We also maintain a global Inclusivity Council, which is led by two of our executives and aims to address actions for inclusion, and we have signed The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. 
•Support Employee Wellbeing and Engagement. We prioritize supporting the overall wellbeing of our employees from a physical, mental and emotional, financial and social perspective. We also regularly seek input from employees, including through employee engagement and pulse surveys on specific issues that are intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment that supports our People Promise and measure our culture of compliance and employee comprehension of our business goals. Our fiscal 2021 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of approximately 75% and resulted in engagement scores across all indexes that met or exceeded industry benchmarks. Our global wellbeing program includes a long-standing practice of remote and flexible working arrangements, flexible paid time off in many of our geographies, life planning and retirement readiness programming, wellness platforms and expense reimbursement benefits, fitness challenges and rewards, 24x7 crisis support and employee assistance program, and mental health coaching.
•Offer Competitive Compensation and Ensure Pay Equity. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive, fair and transparent compensation and progressive benefits offerings. We conduct an annual pay fairness assessment of gender globally and of ethnicity in the U.S. and Canada, and take action to ensure we are paying individuals performing similar work equitably, and recently adopted analytic software to enable better global pay fairness assessments. To align performance and stockholder interest, we base our annual incentive compensation on both business and individual performance, we maintain an employee stock purchase plan and we have provided broader employee opportunities for equity compensation in recent years. We also offer competitive family leave, including global family leave to support employees throughout various life stages, carer’s leave, bereavement leave, parental leave that includes a minimum of 18 weeks paid time off for new mothers (including eight weeks recovery and ten weeks bonding) and ten weeks paid time off for new fathers and adoptive parents, and financial assistance for adoptive parents. We offer meaningful retirement benefits and programming to promote retirement readiness among our employee base. In recent years, we have enhanced employer contributions to our North America retirement plans, added our first ESG fund option for employees and, as of October 30, 2021, greater than 99% of our eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada were participating in our defined contribution retirement plans.
•Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our core values, “applause” and spot awards to recognize employee contributions, patent incentive and distinguished engineer awards, and awards recognizing employees who exemplify our commitment to our communities and volunteerism. We believe that providing these recognition programs helps drive strong employee performance.
•Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. As of October 30, 2021, approximately 19% of our employees are “early in career,” or age 30 and under, 53% are “mid-career,” or age 31 to 50, and 28% are “late in career,” or age 51 and over. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training and education at all career stages, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company, early in career and new graduate networking and development programs, management and leadership development programs, mentoring programs, and support for continuing education through tuition reimbursement. We also operate 
a leadership succession planning process that aims to develop and retain key talent and ensure business continuity for key roles.
•Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. Through our “Ciena Cares” community program, we provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations, flexible volunteering during work time, and corporate rewards for service hours that can be donated by employees. In fiscal 2020, we launched our digital inclusion initiative, which aims to mobilize our global workforce, leverage our innovation leadership, and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners to bridge the digital divide. Through this initiative, we have funded programming to support underserved students in our global communities by emphasizing digital inclusion and equity through greater connectivity, access to enabling technologies and digital skills development. We have also partnered with Tree-Nation by planting a tree for each existing and new employee at Ciena.
•Promote a Strong Ethical Business Culture. We believe that commitments to good corporate governance and the highest ethical standards are essential to our long-term success, and are dedicated to instilling in our employees a commitment to integrity and business ethics. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards of conduct for Ciena’s directors, officers and employees. All employees are required to complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and we conduct recurring employee affirmations with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and periodic training and communication related to specific topics contained therein. In addition, we maintain a Corporate Compliance Committee that promotes integrity and compliance leadership throughout Ciena, and in 2020 we created and resourced a new dedicated function focused exclusively on Compliance and Ethics. We also maintain several easily accessible internal and external methods by which our employees, business partners, and investors can report concerns relating to the ethical operation of our business, including anonymously where permitted. We conduct surveys of all employees on our compliance program and culture of integrity in order to assess and strengthen our culture and practices and received feedback from approximately 75% of our employees in fiscal 2021.
Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during this unprecedented period. 
•Employees. As of the end of fiscal 2021, most of our offices remain closed with limited exceptions or for certain geographies where conditions and local regulations permit, or for a small number of employees in certain key roles. We have adopted a comprehensive set of global site reopening guidelines, which specify the requirements for and limited circumstances under which we will consider reopening one or more of our offices during the ongoing pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, most of our employees have worked from home on a regular basis, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our business partners. To support and protect our employees, we have also: instituted travel bans and restrictions and taken meaningful precautions in accordance with relevant guidelines to protect the health and safety of the small number of employees who need to be in offices, laboratory environments or at customer or partner sites to perform their roles. We have adopted new employee benefits and wellbeing initiatives, including physical, emotional, mental, and social programming, global pandemic leave, and work from home reimbursement benefits. We have also hosted regular mental wellbeing sessions, internal communication and morale initiatives, and launched new wellbeing platforms that focus on the mental and emotional health needs of our employees during this time.
•Community. In an unprecedented time, we and our global workforce have focused on service and compassion. We have undertaken a range of volunteering and charitable actions to support our neighbors and communities. Among other things, during fiscal 2021 we adopted an enterprise-level goal for our employees to volunteer and provide service to their communities. We have also created and advanced a new community initiative focused on promoting digital inclusion, providing greater opportunities for underserved students through improved access, technology and digital skills, and have undertaken joint community projects with business partners as part of this program.
