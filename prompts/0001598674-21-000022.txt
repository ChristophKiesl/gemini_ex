Item 1.    Business.
Overview
Casper Sleep Inc. is a multi-channel Sleep Company offering a portfolio of obsessively engineered sleep products, including mattresses, pillows, bedding, and furniture, through our e-commerce platform, Casper-owned and operated Sleep Shops across North America and a growing list of best-in-class retail partners. We believe sleep is rapidly becoming the third pillar of wellness and is poised to undergo the same massive transformation that fitness and nutrition have as they became major consumer categories. People spend more time sleeping than on any other single activity throughout their lives. When we sleep better, we experience better hours awake, making us more productive, creative, happy, and healthy.
As the wellness equation increasingly evolves to include sleep, the business of sleep is growing and evolving into what we call the Sleep Economy. We are helping to accelerate this transformation. Our mission is to awaken the potential of a well-rested world, and we want Casper to become the top-of-mind brand for best-in-class products and experiences that improve how we sleep.
As a pioneer of the Sleep Economy, we bring the benefits of cutting-edge technology, data, and insights directly to consumers. We focus on building direct relationships with consumers, providing a human experience, and making shopping for sleep joyful. We meet consumers wherever they are, online and in person, providing a fun and engaging experience, while reducing the hassles associated with traditional purchases.
We do all of this because we understand the consumer. Shopping for sleep is a highly considered and personal decision. Today's consumers research their purchases and move freely back and forth from online to offline. At Casper, we put the consumer first in everything we do and invest to ensure long-term valuable relationships where consumers return again and again to shop for more sleep products and services.
We believe great brands win over the long-term and have the ability to change the culture around them. We have endeavored to build a brand that is genuine, trustworthy, and approachable, as well as fun and playful. Through our investment in a sophisticated and integrated marketing strategy, we engage consumers across the entire consumer journey, from our iconic public transit advertising campaigns, to our experiential retail store concepts, to our category-leading social media presence. We see the Casper brand as a valuable asset that we are utilizing to help capture a large share of the Sleep Economy.
Product innovation and excellence lie at the heart of our business. Since the release of our first product, the award-winning Casper mattress, we have expanded into pillows, sheets, duvets, bedroom furniture, sleep accessories, sleep technology, and sleep services. We design and engineer our products in-house and believe our proprietary research and development process puts Casper on the cutting edge of sleep innovations. We employ a team of data-driven researchers, designers, and engineers focused on building a better night's sleep through innovative new products, such as the newest generation of Casper mattresses launched in March 2020 incorporating new materials, technologies and pricing options, all centered around our mission of bringing better sleep to more consumers. We believe that no other company catering to the Sleep Economy has our level of product development talent, resources, data-driven insights, or expertise.
We seek to deliver a joyful shopping experience, regardless of sales channel. Our consumer experience includes knowledgeable and consultative sales associates, appealing and thoughtfully curated stores, immersive in-store trials, engaging and convenient online shopping, and fast and flexible delivery. The Casper experience allows consumers to seamlessly navigate between online and offline channels, eliminating boundaries, and reducing the friction associated with traditional purchases. As of December 31, 2020 we distributed our products directly to customers in North America through our e-commerce platform, 67 Casper retail stores, and over 20 retail partners.
Our Market
We believe that the Sleep Economy represents a rapidly growing and traditionally fragmented market. Consumers are increasingly recognizing quality sleep as a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Importantly, we believe that sleep consists of more than just the act of sleeping, and instead, includes the entire set of human behaviors that span from bedtime to wake-up and affect sleep quality—this is what we refer to as the Sleep Arc. As consumers become more educated around the serious potential health consequences of poor sleep, they are poised to spend more on sleep products in the same way that they have increased spending in other areas of health and wellness. Unlike other categories of health and wellness, however, historically there were no powerful brands that provided holistic solutions to the Sleep Economy. Instead, the Sleep Economy has traditionally been characterized by a fragmented set of providers across different products, services, and use cases.
Our approach is to offer products and services across the entirety of the Sleep Arc under one brand. Our offerings encompass traditional sleep categories for consumers, such as mattresses, soft goods, and bedroom furniture, and are increasingly focused on non-traditional categories, including products that promote the ideal ambience for sleep, such as lighting, sound, scents, temperature, and humidity; sleep technology, such as tracking devices, medical machines, bedside clocks, and connected devices; sleep supplements, such as sprays, pills, and vitamins; and sleep services, such as digital apps, meditation, sleep programming, and counseling. Beyond the daily sleep needs of adults, we aim to meet a range of use cases with unique product and service needs, such as for travel, children and babies, and pets. We believe we are the first company that understands and serves the Sleep Economy in a holistic way.
Our Growth Strategy
While we are proud of our accomplishments to date, we believe the most exciting opportunities for Casper's growth story lie ahead and we intend to pursue the following strategies to help us achieve this growth.
•Increase Brand Awareness and Equity to Acquire New Customers and Build Enduring Brand Love. Increasing brand awareness and growing favorable brand equity among consumers in both existing and new markets has been, and remains, central to our growth. We drive brand awareness through a combination of sophisticated, multi-layered marketing programs, word-of-mouth referrals, experiential brand events, retail expansion, and ongoing product usage. A core tenet of our brand growth strategy is offering consumers increased ways to engage with our products and services, both online and offline, by building relevant and personalized multi-channel shopping experiences. We remain focused on building favorable brand equity through providing exceptional customer experiences, prioritizing customer research and data in order to develop a deep understanding of our customers' needs, and putting the customer first in all of our decisions in order to deliver a joyful shopping and post-purchase experience.
•Expand Direct-to-Consumer Presence and Network of Retail Partnerships.  As of December 31, 2020, we operated 67 retail stores, up from 60 stores at the end of 2019. We plan to continue the rollout of new Casper retail stores to strengthen our footprint in existing cities, while selectively entering into new cities in the United States, Canada. We continually focus on broadening the appeal of our digital consumer experience by leveraging data and analytics to optimize product discovery and education, product assortment, and pricing, as well as the delivery and post-delivery experience. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we worked with over 20 retail partners. We tailor our approach to each retail partner with a variety of options, including unique floor positioning, visual merchandising, inventory availability, flexible packaging options, training, and marketing support while maintaining consistent brand, pricing, and product SKU offerings across our business. The growth of our offline presence through our retail stores and retail partnerships elevates the reach of our digital consumer experience. We believe our multi-channel expansion creates synergies.
•Continue Leadership as a Sleep Destination.  We plan to continue to offer products and services that span and work together across the entire Sleep Arc. We believe this expansion will attract new customer segments and retail partners, as well as enhance average order value, increase attachment rate opportunities, and deliver higher overall customer lifetime value. Casper Labs sits at the center of our ability to continue bringing innovative and enhanced performance-driven products to market with both speed and excellence. We anticipate that growth of our products and services will span entirely new categories of the Sleep Arc, including new sleep technologies that address the environmental factors of light, sound, touch, and scent; new services and content such as digital apps, meditation, sleep programming and counseling; and new use cases for our products, including options for travel, children and babies, and pets.
•Drive Continued Operational Excellence.  We are committed to improving productivity and profitability through a number of operational initiatives designed to grow our revenue and expand our margins. To date, we have had significant success improving our gross margins, achieving 51.1% in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, up from 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe there is opportunity for continued improvement in gross margins, marketing efficiencies, and operating leverage through these key initiatives:
•Optimize pricing;
•Reduce product returns;
•Optimize supply chain efficiencies and infrastructure;
•Drive marketing efficiencies; and
•Achieve operating leverage.
Products
The sleep experience extends beyond the time we are asleep. Casper believes sleep solutions should do the same. We envision the sleep experience as an arc, from soothing pre-bedtime rituals, to late night dreams, and awakening rituals. We design products to address the full Sleep Arc because we believe it is the best way to truly improve sleep.
Our design philosophy is centered on the idea that sleep is both deeply technical and highly personal. Our approach to design is rooted in this belief, which balances the scientific and the emotional aspects. We call it "Cozy Performance" and we express that in every product and experience we design. All Casper products are thoughtfully designed and rigorously tested to provide sleep solutions grounded in consumer needs, preferences, insights, and feedback. We use high-quality materials that provide quality sleep with an emphasis on look and feel.
We thoughtfully curate our product and service offerings. We offer a limited selection of distinct products in each category at various price points, which target a range of consumer needs and budgets. As we expand our product portfolio, we intend to develop sleep products that address the factors of sight, sound, smell, touch, temperature, humidity, and body position across the full Sleep Arc, which will offer distinct and complementary benefits to our existing offerings. Our product and services portfolio as of December 31, 2020 is comprised of six categories: mattresses, soft goods, furniture, connected sleep, accessories and third-party products, and services.
Mattresses
At the core of the Sleep Arc, the mattress is the base for a good night's sleep. Our thoughtfully-designed mattresses provide comfort, including ergonomic support, thermal comfort, pressure relief, motion isolation, easy position realignment, and long-term durability. We currently offer mattresses at multiple tiers to address the needs of different consumers, such as the Casper Wave Series, Nova Series, Original Series, and Element Mattress. Each of our mattresses has our signature “Just Right” feel and utilizes a highly breathable, bouncy, soft top layer over a pressure relieving memory foam layer, which is designed to support, comfort, and cool the body, leading to better-quality sleep. All of our mattresses are designed and engineered in-house by the research and development team at Casper Labs. Additionally, each of our mattresses sold through our direct-to-consumer channel has a 100-night, risk-free trial and a 10-year limited warranty. All mattresses are compressed, roll-packed, and shipped in our innovative box and delivered to customers through common carrier delivery, in-store pick-up, or in-home set-up.
Soft Goods
Sleep soft goods, such as pillows, sheets, and blankets, offer both emotional and functional benefits for consumers. Soft goods have a measurable impact on sleeping quality through breathability, humidity management, and ergonomic support. Due to the intimate nature and high visibility of these products in the home, consumers' decisions are also affected by a number of elements like brand, materials, softness, colorways, and other aesthetic points. Casper has created a line of soft goods that balances the emotional and functional considerations, offering pillows with innovative design features and multiple fill options, sheets, duvets, weighted blankets, mattress protectors and throw blankets.
Furniture
We created a line of furniture that was rigorously designed and tested to further support a positive sleeping experience for our customers. Our furniture offerings provide a natural attachment to our mattresses and consist of a variety of static and adjustable bed frames, including the Casper Haven Bedframe and Casper Repose Bedframe, our newest bedframes launched in August 2020.
Connected Sleep
Technology does not yet play a meaningful role in helping most people sleep, and in fact, often contributes to chronic lack of sleep. We believe, however, that well-designed sleep technology can significantly improve sleep quality and behaviors. Our Glow Light leverages both science and emotion to enable better sleep throughout the complete Sleep Arc, and is 
complemented by the Casper Glow app (available on both iOS and Android) for setup and customization. There is also opportunity for development of new sleep technologies across the full Sleep Arc as well as across environmental factors like light, sound, touch, and scent. We believe that technology will increasingly play a role in improving sleep quality.
Accessories and Third-Party Products
We design and curate products and services across The Sleep Arc. Our accessories and third-party products address various needs along The Sleep Arc and help promote sleep quality for consumers. Our current accessory products include the Casper Nap Pillow, Mattress Topper and Dog Bed. Casper is frequently approached by other innovative companies seeking to introduce their products to our customers. Likewise, our customers look to us for recommendations on additional products that can help them achieve better sleep. As a result, we occasionally partner with other companies on curating and selling third-party products that we believe enhance the sleep experience and reinforce our position as an authority on sleep.
Services
We offer services that complement and complete the sleep experience. Our service offerings are currently focused on providing a seamless purchase and delivery experience, offering an extended warranty and providing a range of financing and delivery options. 
We aim to offer services that provide customers the opportunity to interact in new ways. In early 2019, we launched The Casper Sleep Channel—providing complimentary and engaging social media platform offering meditations, bedtime stories, and sounds to help you fall asleep. The Casper Sleep Channel content is informed by members of our Sleep Advisory Board. With the launch of The Casper Sleep Channel, we are demonstrating our leadership across the Sleep Arc and further owning the hour before bedtime.
Consumer-Centric Multi-Channel Strategy
We meet consumers where they prefer to engage with us through our direct-to-consumer platforms and retail partners. We offer a consistent Casper experience that is centered on sleep across all channels.
Buying sleep products is a very personal decision, and most consumers take time to research and compare options, solicit advice from friends and family, and draw upon previous experiences before making their purchase decision. As consumers move between the online and offline channels to inform their decisions, we work tirelessly to engineer shopping experiences that emphasize both the simplicity of our product portfolio, as well as the consistency in the Casper brand experience and product design across all of our channels. Unlike most other Sleep Economy companies, Casper puts the shopping experience on the consumers” terms, facilitating brand discovery across multiple consumer touchpoints, empowering consumers to seamlessly navigate between traditional offline and online boundaries, and offering a convenient and easy path to purchase with flexible delivery options and a range of financing options. Our go-to-market approach leverages multiple channels to create a differentiated and joyful experience, eliminating friction and boundaries. The Casper experience allows consumers to seamlessly navigate between online and offline channels, eliminating boundaries, and reducing friction associated with traditional purchases.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
Casper.com provides a friendly and educational shopping experience, inviting consumers to enter and explore our brand. The site offers our entire product portfolio and features sleep education, empowering the consumer to design a sleep experience that meets their individual needs. The website delivers differentiated customer service by allowing consumers to communicate with a Sleep Specialist directly through the “talk to a human” portal including phone, chat and email support. Because our website serves as a touchpoint for consumers at various points in their journey, our goal is for casper.com and retail locations to feel like one continuous store. As such, we use our website to facilitate discovery of our physical locations through our store directory and sleep trial appointment portal.
Since our founding, consumers began knocking on the door of our first office to try Casper products, and we quickly recognized the importance of physical retail. This prompted us to launch sleep-centered pop-up stores and to experiment with a wide variety of interactive and experiential retail concepts. We have leveraged those experiences and data to design our stores from the ground up.
We launched our first retail concept in Los Angeles in 2015, followed by permanent retail stores in San Francisco and New York in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2020, we had 67 retail store locations across the United States and Canada. Our retail stores are thoughtfully designed to deliver an intimate trial experience and the opportunity to interact with our full portfolio of sleep products in a fun, relaxed manner. The store environment is bright, cheerful, sleep-themed, and 
full of delightful features. The retail stores feature a modular, flexible design to optimize individual store flow, enabling different floor set-ups as we launch new products, reflect seasonal changes, and improve client flow. Each store stocks most of our products in inventory, allowing consumers to take products home immediately if they wish to.
Our retail store culture is built around a “one team” concept with deep expertise from a variety of top retailers and industries. They are data-driven, highly iterative, and obsessively responsive to consumer feedback. We staff our retail stores with trained Sleep Specialists who are able to provide consumers a consultative and personal experience by listening carefully and then recommending the best solutions to address their sleep needs and budget.
We undertake extensive market research and leverage both internal proprietary models and third-party tools to select optimal high foot-traffic and visible locations to open our retail stores. We have developed new store opening procedures, using each new opening as a learning opportunity to refine the process further. This strategy focuses on maximizing the probability of our stores' success while balancing cost control and speed to open.
Retail Partnerships
Our network of retail partners’ stores and websites improves Casper’s brand awareness, builds credibility and opens up new geographies and demographics to us. We are often approached to work with industry-leading retailers and selectively partner with those that have an image and approach that are consistent with our mission and values. These relationships are mutually beneficial, as the Casper brand and quality of offerings help drive foot and website traffic in key demographics for our retail partners, while also increasing traffic to casper.com and Casper stores in the cities where we have retail partnerships.
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 20 retail partners, including Amazon, Costco, Hudson's Bay Company, and Target, that sell our products across the United States and Canada. Generally, Casper products sold through retail partners are consistent with respect to the SKUs, pricing, and product features offered in our direct-to-consumer channel to ensure a cohesive customer-centric focus across all channels. We do however tailor product offerings to match each partner’s target consumer positioning and to provide differentiation for our direct-to-consumer channel.
Marketing
From the beginning, our brand voice and aesthetic focus have set us apart in an industry that, in our view, desperately needed a wake-up call. Our brand narrative has expanded to champion the importance and power of sleep, which we see as a key long-term differentiator. Casper's sophisticated, integrated marketing strategy enables us to maintain consistent messaging across a dynamic array of marketing channels and directly engage consumers wherever they are. We leverage our ability to interact directly with consumers across this diverse yet cohesive network of touchpoints to build meaningful, long-lasting consumer relationships. Casper's marketing effectiveness has made us a trusted brand name with strong brand awareness among consumers, and helps generate a significant amount of positive press endorsement and credible third-party reviews and accolades.
Our marketing approach reflects our focus on constant, data-driven experimentation and advanced analytics. We have proprietary marketing decision models that inform our absolute spend, relative spend allocation among marketing channels and the daily, and sometimes even hourly, pacing of our spend. Our data, experimentation and analytics sit at the heart of our marketing efforts, helping us to optimize our programs and identify opportunities for testing and expansion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested $156.8 million in marketing. As sales through our owned retail stores and retail partners increase over time, we expect continued improved in our marketing efficiency (which we define as net revenue as a percentage of total media spend over a specific time period), as increasing sales through these channels requires minimal incremental marketing investment, thus helping drive natural leverage in our marketing efficiency. 
Our Product Development and Innovation
From its founding, Casper recognized the importance of bringing reimagined and performance-based sleep products, services, and experiences to market. We believe product, services, and experience innovation is a key differentiator and we invest significant resources into research and development. Our research and data-driven development process is rooted in three types of insight:
•Consumer Needs and Behaviors.  Physical and emotional needs around sleep, sleep rituals, and consumer shopping behaviors regarding sleep products and services.
•Sleep Science.  Biology and physics of sleep and how our products and experiences can leverage those disciplines to improve the quality of sleep.
•Manufacturing.  Study of materials and manufacturing methods that help to perfect sleep science in order to address consumer needs.
These combined insights guide us to new product, service, and experience ideas and new interpretations of existing product solutions.
We look to create products that solve human sleep needs. Instead, we perform regular and detailed qualitative field work and deep quantitative studies to understand consumer sleep patterns, behaviors, and preferences. We review primary scientific literature regarding sleep and work with our Sleep Advisory Board in concept generation and validation. We then enter an iterative process of prototyping and testing to refine and further validate ideas. Once we finalize design, materials selection and supply base, we move into production validation and manufacturing with third-party vendors. We believe this insight-led, iterative approach is unique in our industry.
Our product development and innovation team is part of Casper Labs and is comprised of researchers, scientists, engineers and support staff. Casper Labs is focused on building a better night of sleep through new product and services development and the continuous improvement of existing offerings. Our in-house product development and innovation team controls every aspect of our product offerings, including requirements, design and construction, material performance requirements, manufacturing protocols, supplier selection, packaging specifications and quality plans, among others. We perform simulated and human subject testing on our product offerings and test against a wide range of factors, including pressure, humidity, temperature, firmness, bounce, support, airflow, thermal resistance, compression, durability, sink and ergonomics. Further, we have developed a number of proprietary tools and tests to help measure certain aspects of sleep quality, including spinal alignment, sleep microclimate tracking and sleep state tracking, among others, to continuously improve the way people sleep.
Our Supply Chain, Distribution and Inventory Management
Manufacturing Partners 
We manage a global supply chain of highly qualified, third-party manufacturing and logistics partners to produce and distribute our products. We work with partners who deliver production flexibility and scalability, can support new products, help our growing channel strategies, deliver low costs, and meet other required operational needs. Our global supply chain management team, including personnel in the United States and Asia, manages these relationships and processes. This team researches materials and equipment, qualifies raw material suppliers, and assesses potential manufacturing partners for advanced production and quality assurance processes. They also direct our internal demand and production planning, approve and manage product purchasing plans, and oversee product fulfillment and transportation. We work with our manufacturing partners to ensure product quality and manufacturing process efficiency.
We currently have third-party manufacturing partners located in various locations, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, Portugal, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States, conformance standards through frequent involvement, reporting requirements, contractual standards, and regular product and facility inspections. We create and provide the specifications for our products, own many of the molds and tooling that are critical in production of our products, and work closely with our manufacturing partners to improve their yield and efficiency. As such, our manufacturers are not required to have unique skills, technologies, processes, or intellectual property that factor into our ability to migrate to other manufacturing partners. While we have selected manufacturers for commercial and operational reasons, and our three largest mattress product manufacturers comprised over 70% of our production volume during the year ended December 31, 2020, there are alternative firms that we believe we can qualify and engage to supply products and materials of the same quality, in similar quantities, and on substantially similar terms as our current providers. Further, to facilitate supplier collaboration and enhance order visibility, we have invested in enterprise resource planning technology and improved our advanced internal forecasting capabilities. 
The primary raw materials and components of our mattress products include foam, cotton, fabrics and roll goods that consist of fiber, ticking and non-woven materials. Non-mattress products' primary raw materials and components include steel, cotton, linen, wood, plastic, LED lighting materials, fabrics and roll goods, consisting of fiber, ticking and non-woven material (polyurethane foam, polyester fabric, wood, aluminum, steel, plastic, fiber, down, cotton and wool). We believe many of these materials are available from multiple vendors. We stipulate approved suppliers and control the specifications for key raw materials used in our products utilizing product lifecycle management software along with advancements in our qualification and engineering change management processes. We do not directly source significant amounts of these raw materials and components.
To enforce our stringent product quality standards and exercise additional control over our manufacturing processes, we own product tooling and develop and approve manufacturing processes and quality assurance plans. To ensure consistent product quality, we provide detailed specifications for our products and inspect finished goods both at our manufacturing partners and upon delivery to our third-party logistics partners. As part of our quality assurance program we have developed and implemented comprehensive product inspection and facility oversight processes. These processes are performed by our employees and third-parties, who work closely with our suppliers to assist them in meeting our quality standards, improving their production yield, and throughput. For more information, please refer to "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Supply Chain, Distribution and Inventory Management—"We currently rely exclusively on third-party contract manufacturers whose efforts we are unable to fully control" for a discussion of certain risks that may be encountered in connection with our reliance on third-party manufacturers.
Distribution and Inventory Management
Approximately half of our mattresses are shipped directly to our customers from our manufacturers. This inventory strategy allows us to minimize inventory investment while providing an average order-to-delivery period of approximately three days. We also work with multiple third-party logistics and warehouse management providers to warehouse our products and manage shipments to our customers. These providers manage distribution activities including product receipt, warehousing, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping. They are strategically located in key markets to provide fast order-to-delivery times. Our warehouse management system at these distribution centers interfaces with our order management and enterprise resource planning systems to ensure inventory visibility and management. We believe our domestic and international providers have sufficient expansion capacity to meet our future needs.
In addition to our warehouse management partners, we also partner with a national provider of in-home set-up and removal for select products for consumers that opt into such services. In connection with the in-home set-up service, our customers can schedule and manage the delivery of their orders for certain products, with, as of the date of this filing, two of our key city markets offering same day scheduling. 
We manage inventory by forecasting demand, analyzing product sell-through, and analyzing our supply chain to ensure sufficient availability.
Competition
We operate across the Sleep Economy, including in the mattress, soft goods, bedroom furniture, sleep technology and sleep services industries. We compete primarily on brand awareness, innovation, product quality and breadth, the quality of shopping experience, price, speed of delivery and product performance. The competitive environment of the industries in which we operate causes us to be subject to the risk of loss of market share, loss of significant consumers, reductions in margins and the inability to acquire new consumers.
Within the mattress category, we compete primarily with legacy mattress manufacturers, retailers, and direct-to-consumer companies. Within the soft goods category we compete in a diverse and fragmented market that includes new direct-to-consumer entrants, designer labels, and legacy mattress manufacturers that also sell soft goods. With respect to the bedroom furniture category, which includes bedframes and lighting, we compete mainly with department and furniture stores and primarily online retailers. Finally, in the broader sleep category, which includes sleep technology, supplements and scents, among other things, we compete against a vast variety of fragmented firms across multiple industries.
We understand that the path to purchase typically includes multiple touchpoints across both physical and online sales channels and can span weeks or months of education and deliberation. We have built a company based on this understanding of our consumers' purchasing behavior, with a focus on building long-term relationships where consumers return again and again to shop for more sleep products and services. We believe our trusted brand, continued investment into the consumer experience, innovative products, multi-channel approach, and relentless focus on data have resulted in strong customer relationships with significant lifetime values.
Intellectual Property
We have developed proprietary technologies that we believe provide us with an advantage in the Sleep Economy in which we operate. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights, including our intellectual property rights in these proprietary technologies, through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to restrict access to and disclosure of our intellectual property. Although many of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are not material to our business individually, we believe that, in 
the aggregate, our intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand and the favorable perception of our products.
We own approximately four issued U.S. utility patents, six pending U.S. patent applications and 19 pending foreign patent applications. If the U.S. utility patents currently issued to us are maintained until the end of their terms, they will expire between 2035 and 2037. We have also obtained protection for certain of our product designs. We own at least one registered design in each of Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, and Mexico, six in Australia, and own eight U.S. design patents and nine U.S. design patent applications. Assuming they are maintained, the U.S. design patents currently issued to us will expire between 2032 and 2037, and the foreign design registrations will expire between 2025 and 2044. We also own approximately 32 U.S. trademark registrations, 136 foreign trademark registrations, 35 pending U.S. trademark applications and 43 pending foreign trademark applications, including for the marks Casper, Awaken the Potential of a Well-Rested World and We’re a Sleep Company, We Can Dream Can’t We?. While trademark registrations in both the United States and foreign countries have terms of limited duration (which may vary from country to country), there is no limit on the number of times that the registrations may be renewed if they remain in use in commerce, and if all required filings and payments are made with the applicable trademark offices. Further, even if a federal registration of a trademark in the United States is not renewed, the owner of the trademark may retain its common law trademark rights thereafter, for as long as the marks remain in use in commerce in the applicable state(s). Additionally, we own two U.S. copyright registrations and three Canadian copyright registrations. We do not view any of these registered copyrights as material to our business. For a discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our efforts to protect and maintain our intellectual property may not be successful. Competitors have attempted and will likely continue to attempt to imitate our products and technology. We may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing in a manner that capitalizes on our intellectual property. If we are unable to protect or preserve our intellectual property, our business may be harmed, and if our products or marketing violate the intellectual property rights of others, we may have liability and may be required to change our products and business practices."
Technology
Technology is at the core of our strategy, powering our operational capabilities and the sustainable scalability of our platform. We believe that continuous investment in our technology has given us a competitive advantage and enabled fast innovation. Our service-oriented architecture combines custom, developed in-house applications with third-party software and services. Our infrastructure and services architecture provide security and data isolation.
We license technology, content and other intellectual property from technology providers and partners when a commercial license and support are available, which can provide added value and operating efficiencies to our business and integrate through our platform. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Growth—We rely significantly on information technology, or IT, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, or any failure by us or our service providers to adequately protect our or third-party information assets from cyber-based attacks or other incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of certain risks that may be encountered in connection with our reliance on information technology.
Seasonality and Quarterly Comparability
Our revenue includes a seasonal component, with the highest sales activity normally occurring during the second and third quarters of the year due to back-to-school, home moves and other seasonal factors, along with seasonal promotions we offer during these quarters. The timing of on-boarding new retail partnerships, which typically launch with large inventory buy-ins, and the timing of launching new products may also impact comparability between periods. These factors can also impact our working capital and/or inventory balances in a given period. The COVID-19 pandemic as well as certain supply chain disruptions primarily in the third quarter impacted our quarterly comparability in 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions may impact our seasonality and quarterly comparability will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict due to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, unusual weather conditions and other economic uncertainties as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 442 full-time employees. We also employed 192 part-time employees. We employed 599 people in the United States, 34 people in Canada, and one person in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. 
We believe promoting a diverse, inclusive and equitable culture is critical to the long-term success of our company. As part of our commitment to ensuring a diverse and representative organization, our Talent Acquisition team is committed to recruiting a diverse candidate slate for all open positions and eliminating unconscious bias from recruitment and talent 
identification processes. We also strive to ensure diverse representation on all candidate interview panels and have implemented behavioral interview training to provide our employees with the tools to effectively identify talent. In addition, our employee-led Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council helps inform, shape and define the Company's priorities and strategy for building a more equitable, transparent and inclusive community for all of our stakeholders. 
Supporting a high-performance culture through promoting employee development and engagement remains one of our top strategic priorities. We have a dedicated Learning and Development team responsible for working with our corporate and retail teams to identify team and employee-specific training and development needs to help inform our programmatic design. Based on these needs, we have developed and continue to refine a variety of tailored training programs to enrich the development of our teams, ranging from management skills training, retail associate and customer experience training, as well as a company-wide sleep training program created in collaboration with our Sleep Advisory Board focused on the science of sleep, sleep behaviors, and the social dimensions of sleep.
As part of our continual focus on employee engagement, we launched an annual, week-long company-wide offsite in the first quarter of 2021 to drive cross-functional alignment around the Company's mission, vision and strategy, and to build and deepen relationships across the Company. In addition, we hold ourselves accountable on employee engagement and inclusion metrics by conducting two surveys each year to measure employee engagement and sentiment, followed by company-wide and department-specific action planning.
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our employees while incentivizing superior performance. We regularly benchmark and review our compensation and benefits programs against market peers to ensure they remain competitive. The structure of our compensation and benefits programs incentivizes both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically, we provide employees with competitive base pay commensurate with employee positions, skill levels, and experience, as well as variable incentive compensation opportunities linked to both Company and individual performance. In addition, a portion of the long-term incentives for our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer is based on achieving certain net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets in order to reinforce alignment between our executives' compensation and the interests of our shareholders.
Lastly, a key tenet of our benefits program is to enable our employees to embody the Company's mission to awaken the potential of a well-rested world. We do this in part by empowering and incentivizing employees to live healthier lives through IncentFit, a wellness program through which all corporate employees can earn up to $1,200 each year for completing healthy activities, such as sleep and exercise. In addition, all benefit-eligible employees have access to a fully subsidized "wellness bundle," which includes virtual physical therapy, smoking cessation, mental health and mindfulness, and fertility support services, among others.
Government Regulation
Our mattress and other sleeping products are subject to various foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to flammability, sanitation and other standards. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations. In the United States, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted rules relating to fire retardancy standards for the mattress industry. Many foreign jurisdictions also regulate fire retardancy standards. Future changes to these standards may require modifications to our products to comply with such changes. Various federal, state and other regulatory agencies may adopt new laws, rules and regulations and compliance with such new laws, rules and regulations may increase our costs, alter our manufacturing processes and impair the performance of our products.
Moreover, as a direct-to-consumer retailer, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that apply to retailers generally and govern the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of both our retail stores and our e-commerce activities. Advertising and marketing of our products in the United States, for example, are subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Among other things, the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair false or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC Act also makes it illegal to disseminate or cause to be disseminated any false advertisement. Similarly, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, has enforcement authority under the Canadian Anti-Spam Law, which prohibits the sending of commercial emails without prior consent of the recipient or an existing business relationship and sets forth rules governing the sending of commercial emails. This law allows for a private right of action for the recovery of damages or provides for enforcement by CRTC permitting the recovery of significant civil penalties, costs and attorneys' fees in the event that regulations are violated. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements which impact our retail and e-commerce operations are consumer-focused and pertain to activities such as the advertising and selling of credit-based promotional offers, truth-in-advertising, privacy, "do not call/mail" requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements, accessibility and similar requirements. In addition, the applicability of existing laws to practices conducted over the internet—in particular laws relating to intellectual property ownership and 
infringement—is uncertain and evolving. Regulators are also imposing new rules regarding products offered over the internet, including rules regarding taxation and product quality. Many governmental authorities in the markets in which we operate are also considering alternative legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose regulations on internet advertising. We cannot predict whether new laws, rules, regulations or taxes will apply to our business and whether and how we will be affected. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Government regulation of the internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to various advertising and marketing regulations that may result in actions against us."
We process, use and store data we collect from and about consumers to operate our business and market our products. We may also share consumer information with third-party vendors and service providers in order to facilitate the provision of our products and services. In addition, subject to applicable data privacy and consumer protection laws, we may also share consumer information with certain third parties for marketing purposes. These and related practices—which involve the use of consumer data—are subject to data protection laws, consumer protection laws, and laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. In addition, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or PCI DSS, because we collect credit card information. Increased regulation of data protection, privacy and security may restrict our activities and make it more difficult to reach consumers.
The United States, at both the federal and state level, and Canada are increasingly regulating activities on the internet and e-commerce, including the use of consumer information collected through the internet. In particular, these laws and regulations are increasingly concerned with user privacy and information security. For example, California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives residents of California many statutory rights to access, control and delete their personal data. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Failure to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition."
We are subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business and have established processes for compliance with these laws and regulations. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business is subject to a wide variety of U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, as well as any new or changed laws or regulations, could disrupt our operations or increase our compliance costs. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a further adverse impact on our business."
