ITEM 1. Business. 
General Development of Business 
 Hexcel Corporation and its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Hexcel”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), is a leading advanced composites company. We develop, manufacture, and market lightweight, high-performance structural materials, including carbon fibers, specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, honeycomb, adhesives, radio frequency / electromagnetic interference (“RF/EMI”) and microwave absorbing materials, engineered honeycomb and composite structures, for use in Commercial Aerospace, Space & Defense, and Industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide variety of end applications, such as commercial and military aircraft, space launch vehicles and satellites, wind turbine blades, automotive, recreational products, and other industrial applications.  
 We serve international markets through manufacturing facilities, sales offices and representatives located in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, India, and Africa. We also have a presence in Malaysia where we are a partner in a joint venture which manufactures composite structures for Commercial Aerospace applications.
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.  The outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures.  In addition, governments, and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19.
 
Our company is a sole provider for many programs, including critical defense programs. Consistent with national guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we are currently operating across our footprint with some temporary site closures. Notwithstanding our continued operations, COVID-19 has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, all of which have and may continue to compress our margins, even after the preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments, are taking. The COVID-19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets globally. The resulting economic downturn has, and could for an extended period of time, adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products, services and raw materials. The progression of the pandemic could also continue to negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers.
 
In 2020, our operations, margins and results were adversely impacted by lower demand for our products due to substantial reductions in original equipment manufacturer build rates combined with a move to reduce inventory throughout our supply chain, particularly carbon fiber. Since the outbreak began, we have seen the impacts of COVID-19 on our markets and operations including significant decreases in air traffic, temporary shutdowns of our customers’ and suppliers’ facilities and decreased demand from our customers. In response, we have taken certain mitigating actions to align our costs with the lower sales and to preserve liquidity including eliminating approximately 35% of our global headcount, curtailing discretionary spend, and suspending dividend payments and stock repurchases.  The extent to which COVID-19 continues to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, including the timing of the global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any other new information concerning the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects and the emergence and impact of new variants of COVID-19. While we expect the pandemic to continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the continuing financial impact to us cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 results of operations, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
On January 12, 2020, we announced that we had entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Woodward, Inc. (“Woodward”), which provided for the combination of Hexcel and Woodward in an all-stock merger of equals. In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 5, 2020, Hexcel and Woodward entered into an agreement to terminate the Merger Agreement. In addition, on April 6, 2020, our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “right”) for each outstanding share of our common stock and adopted a stockholder rights plan, as set forth in the Rights Agreement dated as of April 6, 2020, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (the “rights agreement”). The dividend was paid on April 16, 2020 to Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 16, 2020, and the rights will expire on April 6, 2021. The stockholder rights plan was adopted in response to the extraordinary business and market dislocations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain it, as well as the termination of the Merger Agreement with Woodward, Inc. The stockholder rights plan was not adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the Company.

Fabrics, Multi-axials and Specialty Reinforcements: HexForce® fabrics, multi-axials and specialty reinforcements are made from a variety of fibers, including carbon, glass, aramid and other high strength polymers, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. These reinforcements are used in the production of prepregs and other matrix materials for third-party customers as well as for our own use. They are also used in the manufacture of a variety of industrial and recreational products such as wind energy blades, automotive components, oil exploration and production equipment, boats, surfboards, skis and other sporting goods equipment. 
 Prepregs: HexPly® prepregs are manufactured for sale to third-party customers and for internal use by our Engineered Products segment in manufacturing composite laminates and monolithic structures. Prepregs are used in primary and secondary structural aerospace applications such as wing components, horizontal and vertical stabilizer components, fairings, radomes, engine fan blades and cases, engine nacelles as well as overhead storage bins and other interior components. They are also used in many of the industrial and recreational products noted above.  Prepregs are manufactured by combining high-performance reinforcement fabrics or unidirectional fibers with a resin matrix to form a composite material that, when cured, has exceptional structural properties not present in either of the constituent materials. Prepregs are applied via hand layup, automatic tape layup and advanced fiber placement to produce finished composite components.  Prepreg reinforcements include glass, carbon, aramid, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. Resin matrices include bismaleimide, cyanate ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide and other specialty resins. 
 Other Fiber-Reinforced Matrix Materials: Fiber reinforced matrix developments include HexMC®, a form of quasi-isotropic carbon fiber prepreg that enables small to medium sized, complex-shaped, composite components to be mass produced. HexTool® is a specialized form of HexMC® for use in the cost-effective construction of high temperature resistant composite tooling. HexFIT® film infusion material is a product that combines resin films and dry fiber reinforcements to save lay-up time in production and enables the manufacture of large contoured composite structures, such as wind turbine blades. 
 Resins: HexFlow® polymer matrix materials are sold in liquid and film form for use in direct process manufacturing of composite parts. Resins can be combined with fiber reinforcements in manufacturing processes such as resin transfer molding, resin film infusion or vacuum assisted resin transfer molding to produce high quality composite components for both aerospace and industrial applications, without the need for customer investment in autoclaves. 
 Structural Adhesives: We manufacture and market a comprehensive range of HexBond® film and paste adhesives. These structural adhesives, which bond metal to metal and composites and honeycomb structures, are used in the aerospace industry and for many industrial applications. 
 Honeycomb: HexWeb® honeycomb is a lightweight, cellular structure generally composed of a sheet of nested hexagonal cells. It can also be manufactured in over-expanded and asymmetric cell configurations to meet special design requirements such as contours or complex curvatures. Honeycomb is primarily used as a lightweight core material and acts as a highly efficient energy absorber. When sandwiched between composite or metallic facing skins, honeycomb significantly increases the stiffness of the structure, while adding very little weight. 
 We produce honeycomb from a number of metallic and non-metallic materials. Most metallic honeycomb is made from aluminum and is available in a selection of alloys, cell sizes and dimensions. Non-metallic materials used in the manufacture of honeycomb include fiberglass, carbon fiber, thermoplastics, non-flammable aramid papers, aramid fiber and other specialty materials. 
 We sell honeycomb as standard blocks and in slices cut from a block. Aerospace is the largest market for honeycomb products.
 Our HexWeb® Acousti-Cap® sound attenuating honeycomb provides dramatic noise reduction during takeoff and landing without a structural weight penalty, Acousti-Cap® incorporates a non-metallic, permeable cap material is embedded into honeycomb core. In addition, we produce honeycomb for our Engineered Products segment for use in manufacturing finished parts for airframe Original Equipment Manufacturers. 
 Polyspeed® Pultruded Profiles:  Hexcel manufactures a wide range of pultruded sections including rods, flat sections, tubes and specific profiles that are usually made from carbon fiber but can also be made from glass, quartz, basalt or other fibers.  The profile matrix is a Hexcel formulation of thermoset resin (epoxy or polyurethane).  Hexcel pultruded profiles are used in a wide range of industrial applications.

Commercial Aerospace 
 The Commercial Aerospace industry is our largest user of advanced composites. Commercial Aerospace represented 55% of our 2020 net sales. Approximately 84% of these revenues can be identified as sales to Airbus, Boeing, and their subcontractors for the production of commercial aircraft. Approximately 16% of these revenues were for regional, and business and other commercial aircraft. The economic benefits airlines can obtain from weight savings in both fuel economy and aircraft range, combined with the design enhancement that comes from the advantages of advanced composites over traditional materials, has resulted in the aerospace industry becoming the leader in the adoption and use of these materials. While military aircraft and spacecraft have championed the development of these materials, Commercial Aerospace has had the greater production volumes and has commercialized the use of these products. Accordingly, the demand for advanced structural material products is closely correlated to the demand for new commercial aircraft. 
 The use of advanced composites in Commercial Aerospace is primarily in the manufacture of new commercial aircraft. These composite materials are designed to last the life of the aircraft and engine so as a result, the aftermarket for these products is minimal. The demand for new commercial aircraft is driven by two principal factors, the first of which is airline passenger traffic (the number of revenue passenger miles flown by the airlines) which affects the required size of airline fleets. Growth in passenger traffic requires growth in the size of the fleet of commercial aircraft operated by airlines worldwide. 
 A second factor, which is less sensitive to the general economy, is the replacement rates for existing aircraft. The rates of retirement of passenger and freight aircraft, resulting mainly from obsolescence, are determined in part by the regulatory requirements established by various civil aviation authorities worldwide as well as public concern regarding aircraft age, safety, noise, and emissions. These rates may also be affected by the desire of the various airlines to improve operating costs with higher payloads and more fuel-efficient aircraft (which in turn is influenced by the price of fuel) and by reducing maintenance expense. In addition, pressure is increasing on airlines to replace their aging fleet with more fuel efficient and quieter aircraft to be more environmentally responsible. When aircraft are retired from commercial airline fleets, they may be converted to cargo freight aircraft, used for parts, or scrapped. 
 8


An additional factor that may cause airlines to defer or cancel orders is their ability to obtain financing, including leasing, for new aircraft orders. This will be dependent both upon the financial health of the airline operators, as well as the overall availability of financing in the marketplace. 
 As a result of COVID-19, aircraft manufacturers significantly reduced production rates during 2020 as demand for new aircraft decreased significantly. Additionally, the parked fleet of commercial aircraft reached record levels globally during 2020 as passenger traffic fell and airlines reduced capacity. Future potential aircraft production rate increases will depend on growth in passenger traffic and the number of aircraft retired. 
 Each new generation of commercial aircraft has used increasing quantities of advanced composites, replacing metals and other materials. This follows the trend previously seen in military fighter aircraft where advanced composites may now exceed 50% of the weight of the airframe. Early versions of commercial jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 707, which was developed in the early 1950’s, contained almost no composite materials. One of the first commercial aircraft to use a meaningful amount of composite materials, the Boeing 767 entered into service in 1983, and was built with an airframe containing approximately 6% composite materials. The airframe of Boeing’s 777 aircraft, which entered service in 1995, is approximately 11% composite. The Airbus A380, which was first delivered in 2007, has approximately 23% composite content by weight. Boeing’s B787, which entered into service in 2011, has a content of more than 50% composite materials by weight. The Airbus A350 XWB (“A350”) which has a composite content of 53% by weight was first delivered in December 2014.  Both Airbus and Boeing introduced new versions of their narrow body aircraft which utilize composite-rich engines and nacelles. Airbus’s A320neo had its first customer delivery in 2016 and Boeing’s B737 MAX entered into service in 2017. Boeing’s B737 MAX was subsequently grounded in March 2019 by the federal Aviation Administration and other regulators, which was lifted in select regions by the end of 2020. In 2014, Airbus announced a new version of its A330, the A330neo, which has new engines, and Boeing announced the B777X, a new version of the B777 with composite wings and composite-rich engines.  It is expected that future aircraft platforms will offer more opportunities for composite materials than their predecessors, as the Commercial Aerospace industry continues to utilize a greater proportion of advanced composite materials with each new generation of aircraft and each new generation of engines and nacelles. We refer to this steady expansion of the use of composites in aircraft as the “secular penetration of composites” as it increases our average sales per airplane over time. 
 The impact on Hexcel of Airbus and Boeing production rate changes is typically influenced by two factors: the mix of aircraft produced and the inventory supply chain effects of increases or reductions in aircraft production. We have products on all Airbus and Boeing planes. The shipset or dollar value of our materials varies by aircraft type — twin aisle aircraft use more of our materials than narrow body aircraft and newer designed aircraft use more of our materials than older generations. On average, for established programs, we deliver products into the supply chain about six months prior to aircraft delivery, with a range between one and eighteen months depending on the product and specific aircraft platform. For aircraft that are in the development or ramp-up stage we will have sales as much as several years in advance of delivery. 
 Set forth below are historical aircraft deliveries as announced by Airbus and Boeing: 
 
 
 | 2007 | | 2008 | | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | | 2012 | | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | | 2020
-------+------+-----+------+-----+------+------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------+-----
Airbus | | 453 | | 483 | | 498 | | 510 | | 534 | | 588 | | 626 | | 629 | | 635 | | 688 | | 730 | 800 | 863 | 566
Boeing | | 441 | | 375 | | 481 | | 462 | | 477 | | 601 | | 648 | | 723 | | 762 | | 748 | | 763 | 806 | 380 | 157
Total | 894 | | 858 | | 979 | 972 | | 1,011 | | 1,189 | | 1,274 | | 1,352 | | 1,397 | | 1,436 | | 1,493 | | 1,606 | 1,243 | 723

 
Approximately 84% of our Commercial Aerospace revenues can be identified as sales to Airbus, Boeing and their subcontractors for the production of commercial aircraft. Airbus and Boeing combined deliveries in 2020 were 723 aircraft. Their combined backlog at December 31, 2020 was 12,181 aircraft, which decreased approximately 7% compared to December 31, 2019. The production rates in 2020 were unusually low as a result of airlines deferring or cancelling deliveries due to the impact of COVID-19 on air travel and the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX that was only lifted in select regions by the end of 2020. The balance of our Commercial Aerospace sales is related to regional and business aircraft manufacture, and other commercial aircraft applications. These applications also exhibit increasing utilization of composite materials with each new generation of aircraft. 
 Space & Defense 
 The Space & Defense market has historically been an innovator in the use of, and source of significant demand for, advanced composites. The aggregate demand by Space & Defense customers is primarily a function of procurement of military aircraft that utilize advanced composites, primarily by the United States and certain European governments, including both commercial and military helicopters. We are qualified to supply materials to a broad range of helicopter, military aircraft, and space programs, including the Lockheed Martin F-35 (“joint strike fighter” or “JSF”), Boeing V-22 (“Osprey”) tilt rotor aircraft, Black Hawk and Airbus A400M military transport. The JSF, which is our largest program, represents less than 25% of revenues in this market. No 
 9


other program accounts for more than 10% of our revenues in this market. The sales that we obtain from these programs will depend upon which are funded and the extent of such funding. Space applications for advanced composites include solid rocket booster cases, fairings and payload doors for launch vehicles, and satellite buss and solar arrays for military and commercial satellites. 
 Another trend generating growth for Hexcel is the further penetration of composites in helicopter blades. Numerous new helicopter programs in development, as well as upgrade or retrofit programs, have an increased utilization of Composite Materials products such as carbon fiber, prepregs, and honeycomb core to improve blade performance. In addition, our Engineered Products segment provides specialty value added services such as machining, sub-assembly, and even full blade manufacturing for rotorcraft.
 Contracts for military and some commercial programs may contain provisions applicable to both U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. For example, a prime contractor may flow down a “termination for convenience” clause to materials suppliers such as Hexcel. According to the terms of a contract, we may be subject to U.S. government Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement, and associated procurement regulations. As a result of our acquisition of ARC Technologies, LLC (“ARC”), a leading supplier of custom RF/EMI and microwave absorbing composite materials for military, aerospace and industrial applications on January 3, 2019, we have expanded our portfolio of U.S. government contracts and thereby increased our federal legal and regulatory compliance obligations.
 The Space & Defense market represented 30% of our 2020 net sales. While our Space & Defense market has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact has been significantly less than the impact to our Commercial Aerospace market. As a result, our Space & Defense sales comprised a greater percentage of our 2020 net sales than Space & Defense sales have comprised historically. In the prior five fiscal years from 2015 through 2019, Space & Defense sales comprised between 16% and 19% of total net sales. When the Commercial Aerospace market recovers to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, we would expect Space & Defense sales to return to a range generally consistent with historical pre-pandemic percentages.
 Industrial  
 The revenue from this market includes wind turbine blades, automotive, a wide variety of recreational products, marine and other industrial applications. A number of these applications represent emerging opportunities for our products. In developing new applications, we seek those opportunities where advanced composites technology offers significant benefits to the end user, often applications that demand high engineering performance. Within the Industrial market, wind energy comprises the largest submarket and our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S (“Vestas”). Demand in our wind energy submarket declined in 2020 due in part to the commoditization and outsourcing of blades with a change in technology from prepreg to infusion. The Industrial market also includes sales to major end user sub-markets, in order of size based on our 2020 sales: general industrial applications (including those sold through distributors), transportation (e.g., automobiles, mass transit and high-speed rail, and marine applications) and recreational equipment (e.g., skis and snowboards, bicycles and hockey sticks). Our participation in Industrial applications complements our commercial and military aerospace businesses, and in many instances, technology or products now used in aerospace were started in Industrial. We are committed to pursuing the utilization of advanced structural material technology and introducing new innovations to support our customers in response to changing market dynamics in Industrial markets where it can generate significant value and we can maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. 
 Further discussion of our markets, including certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors with respect to “forward-looking statements” about those markets, is contained under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”. 
 Backlog 
 In recent years, our customers have demanded shorter order lead times and “just-in-time” delivery performance. While we have many multi-year contracts with our major aerospace customers and our largest Industrial customer, most of these contracts specify the proportion of the customers’ requirements that will be supplied by us and the terms under which the sales will occur, not the specific quantities to be procured or the specific dates for delivery. Our Industrial customers have always desired to order their requirements on as short a lead-time as possible. As a result, twelve-month order backlog is not a meaningful trend indicator for us. As noted above, our Commercial Aerospace sales to Airbus and Boeing and their subcontractors accounted for 46% of our total 2020 sales, and their airplane backlog represents multiple years of production based on production rates at December 31, 2020. 
Raw Materials and Production Activities 
 Our manufacturing operations are in many cases vertically integrated. One example of the benefits of our vertical integration is that it enables us to control both the carbon fiber surface structure and the resin formulations to optimize their interaction and ensure 
 10


excellent interfacial adhesion or bonding. We produce and internally use carbon fibers, industrial fabrics, composite materials, and composite structures as well as sell these materials to third-party customers for their use in the manufacture of their products. 
 We manufacture high performance carbon fiber from polyacrylonitrile precursor (“PAN”). The primary raw material for PAN is acrylonitrile. All of the PAN we produce is for internal carbon fiber production. We utilized between 60% and 65% by value of the carbon fiber we produced in 2020 and about 75% in 2019, with the remainder of our output sold to third-party customers. However, as one of the world’s largest consumers of high-performance carbon fiber, we also purchase significant quantities of carbon fiber from external sources for our own use. The sources of carbon fiber we can use in any product or application are generally dictated by customer qualifications or certifications. Otherwise, we select a carbon fiber based on performance, price, and availability. With the increasing demand for carbon fiber, particularly in aerospace applications, in recent years we increased our PAN and carbon fiber capacity to serve the growing needs of our customers and our own downstream products. After a new production line starts operating, it can take up to a year to be certified for aerospace applications. However, these lines can start supplying carbon fiber for many industrial applications within a shorter time period. 
 We formulate a variety of resin systems that are tailored to specific applications and support the process for manufacturing composite parts. The type of epoxy and curative used in the resin systems vary depending on the application being considered, including the required service temperature, mechanical performance, and rate of cure. We continually focus on innovation that will help our customers reduce their cycle time and increase their through put, including lower curing temperatures, faster curing times, and enhancing the flow characteristics of the resin formulations, particularly for infusion manufacturing processes.
 We purchase glass yarn for our aerospace and industrial from a number of suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also purchase aramid and high strength fibers which are produced by only a few companies, and during periods of high demand, can be in short supply. In addition, epoxy and other specialty resins, aramid paper and aluminum specialty foils are used in the manufacture of composite products. A number of these products have only one or two sources qualified for use, so an interruption in their supply could disrupt our ability to meet our customer requirements. When entering into multi-year contracts with aerospace customers, we attempt to get back-to-back commitments from key raw material suppliers. 
 Our manufacturing activities are primarily based on “make-to-order”, or “demand pull” based on customer schedules, and to a lesser extent, “make-to-forecast” production requirements. We coordinate closely with key suppliers in an effort to avoid raw material shortages and excess inventories. However, many of the key raw materials we consume are available from relatively few sources, and in many cases the cost of product qualification makes it impractical to develop multiple sources of supply. The lack of availability of these materials could under certain circumstances have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. 
 Research and Technology; Patents and Know-How 
 Research and Technology (“R&T”) departments support our businesses worldwide. Through R&T activities, we maintain expertise in precursor and carbon fiber, chemical and polymer formulation and curatives, fabric forming and textile architectures, advanced composite structures, process engineering, application development, analysis and testing of composite materials, computational design, and other scientific disciplines related to our worldwide business base. 
 Our products rely primarily on our expertise in materials science, textiles, process engineering and polymer chemistry. Consistent with market demand, we have been placing more emphasis on higher performing products and cost-effective production processes while seeking continually to improve the consistency of our products and our capital efficiency. Towards this end, we have entered formal and informal alliances, as well as licensing and teaming arrangements, with several customers, suppliers, external agencies, and laboratories. We believe that we possess unique capabilities to design, develop, manufacture, and qualify composite materials and structures, including trade secrets and extensive internal knowledge gained from decades of experience. It is our policy to actively enforce our proprietary rights. We believe that the patents and know-how rights currently owned or licensed by Hexcel are adequate for the conduct of our business. We do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any single patent or series of related patents, or by the termination of any single license agreement or series of related license agreements. 
 We spent $46.6 million, $56.5 million and $55.9 million for R&T in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our spending, on a constant currency basis, in 2020 was more than 17.9% less than 2019 reflecting cost reduction actions due to COVID-19.  In comparison, 2019 spending was 3.3% higher than 2018. Our spending on a quarter-to-quarter basis fluctuates depending upon the amount of new product development and qualification activities, particularly in relation to commercial aircraft applications, that are in progress. These expenditures are expensed as incurred.

Environmental Matters 
 We view climate-change as an important social issue that presents some level of risk to our business while also creating opportunities for greater composite adoption. Our strategic and operational decision making is influenced by our commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our operations, including our carbon footprint, air and water emissions and waste reduction. We continue to improve our emissions profile through operational efficiency improvements that lessen our use of fossil fuels and by increasing our use of renewable power. We have applied this same approach to our product life cycle, implementing circular economy principles to reduce waste – both in our manufacturing and product packaging. 
 
The increasing global emphasis on emissions reduction is a trend that is supportive of our advanced composite light weighting solutions. Fuel efficiency is improved from composite light weighting, reducing emissions from aircraft and other transportation vehicles in the select markets that we target. We also market composite solutions that reduce aircraft engine noise, which benefits local communities near airports, supports aircraft operators in geographies that are subject to local noise abatement programs, and enables more direct routes for aircraft that saves fuel rather than having to fly longer routes to avoid noise-sensitive areas.
 We are subject to various U.S. and international federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We are also potentially subject to liabilities arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and similar state local and international laws and regulations that impose responsibility for the control, remediation and abatement of air, water and soil pollutants and the manufacturing, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
 Our aggregate environmental related accruals at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, were included in “Other current accrued liabilities”, with the remainder included in “Other non-current liabilities”. As related to certain of our environmental matters, our accruals were estimated at the low end of a range of possible outcomes since there was no better point within the range. If we had accrued, for those sites where we are able to estimate our liability, at the high end of the range of possible outcomes, our accruals would have been $16 million higher at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Environmental remediation spending charged directly to our reserve balance for 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In addition, our operating costs relating to environmental compliance were $14.1 million, $17.1 million, and $15.6 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and were charged directly to expense. Capital expenditures for environmental matters approximated $0.9 million, $3.6 million, and $6.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. 
 These accruals can change significantly from period to period due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination, the methods of remediation required, changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties, as well as the impact, if any, of Hexcel being named in a new remediation matter. A discussion of environmental matters is contained in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” and in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Other Regulatory Matters
 As a materials supplier for U.S. prime contractors, we are subject to certain U.S. government Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement, and associated procurement regulations. As a result of our acquisition of ARC, we have expanded our portfolio of U.S. government contracts and thereby increased our federal legal and regulatory compliance obligations.  Specifically, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures and incur other costs.  Furthermore, failure to comply may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages, civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.
 As a company with significant international operations, we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations, including U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, international treaties and local trade rules around the world.  These laws, rules and regulations may impose significant costs of compliance on the Company and may impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals.  The consequences of any failure to comply with trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business internationally.

Sales and Marketing
A staff of salaried marketing managers, product managers and sales personnel, sell and market our products directly to customers worldwide. We also use independent authorized distributors for certain products, markets, and regions. In addition, we operate various sales representation offices in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, India, and Africa. 
Competition 
 In the production and sale of advanced composites, we compete with a number of U.S. and international companies on a worldwide basis. The broad markets for composites are highly competitive, and we have focused on both specific submarkets and specialty products within markets. In addition to competing directly with companies offering similar products, we compete with producers of substitute composites such as structural foam, wood, and metal. Depending upon the material and markets, relevant competitive factors include technology, product performance, historical database of usage, delivery, service, price, customer preference for sole sourcing and customer preferred processes. 
 
We believe that new competitors face significant barriers to entry into many of our markets. These barriers include the intellectual property and unique skills and expertise to design and manufacture carbon fiber and to formulate resin systems for aerospace applications, an extensive database of qualification and performance measurements of our products, the advantages of scale derived from significant global manufacturing capacity for aerospace-grade carbon fiber, and long-term customer relationships developed over decades of designing, manufacturing and working closely with our customers on composite applications. Further, the aerospace industry has rigorous product certification requirements and quality programs including one hundred percent traceability of all raw material and finished goods, and high expectations for consistent on-time delivery, which all act as barriers to entry.
 Human Capital 
 We believe our success depends on the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our key talent.  As such, our management team places significant focus and attention on the attraction, development, and retention of employees, as well as ensuring our corporate culture reflects Hexcel’s values, and our board of directors provides oversight for various employee initiatives. Our Hexcel values guide our actions, reflect our culture, and drive our performance, as explained in our Code of Business Conduct posted on our website at www.hexcel.com. We have made and continue to make significant investments in training and professional development, and we have well-established performance management and talent development processes that encourage employees to aspire to different career opportunities and for our managers to provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees.
 The health and safety of our employees is also a top priority. Over the past ten years, our focus on the reduction of injuries and illnesses has significantly improved our safety performance. We have attained these improvements by fostering a global safety culture supported with regular training and education that includes robust systems and philosophies centered on personal responsibility and accountability. There is a high-level of leadership engagement, ensuring appropriate safety equipment is installed and operational at all of our manufacturing sites worldwide combined with vigorous reviews of root causation and systemic corrective actions of any safety incidents that may occur.
 In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020, we implemented a proactive internal procedure and complied with local, federal and international governmental guidance that has enabled us to operate safely. Each of our facilities globally continues to adhere to these practices, and we have also adjusted our remote worker safety procedures to ensure that remote employees are better integrated into our safety and health systems.
 An engaged, innovative, skilled, and collaborative workforce is critical to our continued leadership in the advanced composites industry. We operate globally under policies and programs that provide competitive wages, benefits, and terms of employment. We are committed to efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our global workforce through recruiting efforts, equitable compensation policies, and educational workshops to promote a positive and collaborative culture. Our diversity recruitment efforts include targeted university recruitment and attendance at conferences promoting racial and gender diversity in engineering, which have historically been a source of candidates for our summer internship program.
 Employee levels are managed to align with business demand and management believes it currently has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 4,647 full-time employees and contract workers: 2,312 in the United States and 2,335 in other countries. We employ a minimal number of contract workers. Approximately 25% of employees in the United States and the majority of those in Europe are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with employees, unions and works’ councils are good. The total number of full-time employees and contract workers as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 6,977 and 6,626, respectively.
