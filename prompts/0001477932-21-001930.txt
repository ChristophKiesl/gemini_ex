ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the name Imagine Media, Ltd. on August 10, 2007. From inception through early 2009, our business was to publish and distribute Image Magazine, a monthly entertainment guide for the Denver, Colorado area. We generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned our business plan in January 2009.
 
On September 19, 2011, we, Imagine Media, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, acquired approximately 52% of the outstanding shares of TransBiotec, Inc., (“TBT”) from TBT’s directors in exchange for 12,416,462 shares of our common stock. The accounting for this transaction was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill, or other intangibles were recorded, as the members of TransBioTec retained the majority of the outstanding common stock of Imagine Media LTD after the share exchange. These directors of TBT were Charles Bennington, Devadatt Mishal, Nicholas Limer, and Sam Satyanarayana. At the time, these shares represented approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock. TBT was a California corporation. In connection with this transaction, two of our officers resigned and Charles Bennington and Nicholas Limer were appointed as directors and as our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, and our Secretary, respectively, and Ronald Williams was appointed as our Chief Technology Officer.
 
On January 17, 2012, our Board of Directors amended our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Imagine Media, Ltd. to TransBiotec, Inc. On January 31, 2012, we acquired approximately 45% of the remaining outstanding shares of TBT in exchange for 10,973,678 shares of our common stock. In connection with this transaction, two of our directors resigned and Sam Satyanarayana, Ronald Williams and Devadatt Mishal were appointed directors. Because of the September 2011 and January 2012 acquisitions of TBT common stock, we currently own approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of TBT, and we control its Board of Directors and officer positions. The remaining approximately 2% is owned by non-affiliated individuals that did not participate in the share exchange.

Because of the acquisition, TBT’s business is our business and, unless otherwise indicated, any references to “us” or “we” include the business and operations of TBT. Due to our approximately 99% ownership of TBT, the approximately 1% non-controlling interest is combined with ours in the attached financial statements. 
 
On March 9, 2020, in connection with our transaction with IDTEC, LLC (as detailed herein) our Board of Directors approved the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation on March 9, 2020 and stockholders holding 52.24% of our then outstanding voting stock approved the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. The Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation was for the purpose of, among other things, (i) changing our name from “TransBiotec, Inc.” to “SOBR Safe, Inc.”, (ii) effecting a 1-for-33.26 reverse stock split of our common stock, and (iii) decreasing our authorized common stock from 800,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares, and became effective with the State of Delaware on April 24, 2020.
 
As a result of the reverse stock split effected by our Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, every 33.26 shares of our outstanding common stock prior to the effect of that amendment were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock, and the number of outstanding shares of our common stock at the time was reduced from 266,097,657 (pre-split) to approximately 8,000,000 (post-split). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and any of our stockholders that would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will instead receive one additional share of our common stock in lieu of the fractional share. The reverse stock split did not in itself affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of our common stock, except to the extent that any fractional share is rounded up to the nearest whole share. As a result of the reverse stock split all share figures included in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
 
 At the open of trading on June 8, 2020, our new name and reverse stock split went effective with OTC Markets, and we began trading on the “OTC Pink Current Information” tier of OTC Markets on a post reverse stock split basis. Our ticker symbol for the quotation of our common stock is now “SOBR”. On November 16, 2020, we began trading on the “OTCQB” tier of OTC Markets.

Business Overview
 
General
 
We intend to create substance-free environments by integrating and commercializing critical substance detection technologies. These technologies will be integrated within our robust and scalable data platform producing predictive analytics and statistical user data. Our mission is to save lives, accelerate intervention, increase productivity, create significant economic benefit and positively impact behavior. To that end, we developed the scalable, patented SOBRSafe™ software platform for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification, a solution that has anticipated applications in school buses, commercial vehicle fleets and facility access control, as well as addiction treatment and managed care.

Currently, our plan is to deploy our SOBRSafe™ technology in two initial devices: the SOBRtab™ wearable band and the SOBRCheck™ system. 
 


SOBRtab™
 
SOBRtab™ is a transdermal, alcohol-detecting wearable band containing our SOBRSafe™ technology for ongoing, real-time alcohol monitoring, with predictive heart rate monitoring. 
 
SOBRCheck™

SOBRCheck™ is our centralized access control product. When installed in manufacturing facilities, warehouses and more, SOBRCheck™ enables a rapid, hygienic finger scan, with real-time results delivered securely to the employer for any necessary corrective action. 
 
The SOBRSafe™ technology can also be deployed across numerous additional devices for various uses. Currently, additional devices for our SOBRSafe™ alcohol detection technology we are exploring include possible integrations with existing law enforcement technologies to enhance public safety. In addition, we are proactively evaluating other emerging detection technologies for alcohol, cannabis, opioids, human health and more.
 
Statistical analytics and predictive user data is another potential valuable asset. We believe our device portfolio approach could yield a highly valuable information asset. The opportunity to collect millions of data points over time could enable the development of predictive analytics for perpetual safety improvement (and associated cost savings capture). And by demonstrating substance-free environments, employers could deliver a data-driven argument for lowering insurance premiums, and we could potentially partner with insurance providers to mandate use of the SOBRSafe™ devices and/or technology.
 
In addition to focusing on the development, marketing and commercialization of the SOBRCheck™ and SOBRtab™ devices, we are also constantly reviewing synergistic technologies and businesses for potential partnerships, including licensing the SOBRSafe™ technology.
 
The Substance Abuse Problem
 
Our management believes the key to developing a successful product is to find a potential solution to a consumer need that is not being adequately addressed with technologies in the current marketplace. When that need also involves a potential solution for a societal crisis like the impact of substance abuse on the workplace and individual lives then the motivation is even stronger and the potential results that much more impactful.
 
Through crime, lost work productivity and healthcare expenses, the annual cost of alcohol abuse in the U.S. is estimated to be $249 billion. One- half of all industrial accidents involve alcohol, and commercial fleets suffer from over 11,000 alcohol-related accidents each year. We believe we have a solution that addresses this problem, and we anticipate in the second quarter 2021 our technology will be available for use in commercial fleet management, school bus safety and workplace access control in manufacturing facilities and warehouses. 
 
Competitive Advantages 
 
SOBRSafe™ is currently the only preventative transdermal (touch-based) alcohol detection system in the U.S. market – we seek to eliminate the possibility of alcohol-related accidents before they occur, not simply punish the offender post-fact. Companies like SCRAM, BACTRACK, BI TAD, Soberlink, Smart Start, Intoxalock and others are focused on the judicially-mandated market, i.e. breathalyzers for blood alcohol content (BAC) measurement, or court-ordered ankle monitors. Only SOBRSafe™ provides the data needed to get ahead of an issue, not simply react to its consequences.
 
Our SOBRCheck™ device is a patent-pending touch-based identity verification and alcohol detection system that utilizes our SOBRSafe™ system. A user places two fingers on the sensors above; one sensor reads specific data points under the skin (not just relying on a finger print) to confirm identity, and the other senses ethanol secreted via sweat through the pores of the fingertip.

Marketing
 
We have developed a marketing plan that includes 1) multi-channel investor relations, 2) popular and trade media public relations, 3) advocacy group alignment, 4) video-centric social media outreach, 5) deploying savvy business development partners specific to and expert in the market segments/applications defined above and 6) and continual research around the potential integration of detection technology for THC and opiates, to name a few. 
 
We have successfully conducted one pilot program with an international employer, and are in advanced discussion on multiple additional pilot-to-revenue programs. We are working to execute three pilots in the manufacturing space in Q1 2021, in order to perfect the user experience and interface, enrollment process and data collection/management methodology.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our SOBRSafe™ system for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification has been completed and tested. Based on the results of the testing, including in one pilot program, we believe the system is ready for manufacturing in high volume to be included in our various platforms.
 
We are currently pursuing multiple generations of the SOBRtab™ wearable band, each with successively advanced capabilities. Our CTO is also proactively evaluating emerging technologies including light, nano sensors, optics, ECG and more to most accurately detect alcohol, cannabis, opioids and determinants of human health. The current iteration of our SOBRtab™ wearable integrates health monitoring and predictive analytics into a high fashion wearable band.
 
The SOBRCheckTM patent pending, multiuser, touch-based alcohol detection platform with identity detection performed outstanding in human trials and is currently being tooled up for manufacturing.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We currently have the following patent and patent applications related to our SOBRSafe™ system and related devices:
 

1) | U.S. Patent No. 9,296,298, titled “Alcohol detection system for vehicle driver testing with integral temperature compensation”, which expires in 2032.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Provisional Patent Application No. 63,014,776, titled “Non-invasive Transdermal Alcohol Screening System” 
3) | Provisional Patent Application No. 63,109,134, titled “Wearable Data Collection Device w/Non-Invasive Sensing” 



We are applying for trademarks related to the SOBRSafe™ system, SOBRCheck™ and SOBRtab™.
 
Government Regulation
 
At the present time, only the judicially-mandated market is regulated. Devices sold into this market must be approved by state government agencies. Since we utilize a unique Go/No Go methodology that simply alerts to the presence of alcohol (as opposed to measuring a discrete BAC), information that may be used at the discretion of the employer (or counselor, parent, etc.), we do not believe we will be subject to any government regulation.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have seven employees, including Kevin Moore, our Chief Executive Officer; David Gandini, our Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Chief Revenue Officer; and Dean Watson, our Chief Technology Officer. 
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As noted above, we only have a small number of employees. The remainder of our workforce is consultants due to the nature of our business. As it relates to our employees and the consultants that work with us:
Oversight and Management
 
Our executive officers are tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding our human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including persons of color, veterans and LGBTQ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse talent.
Workplace Safety and Health
 
A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. We focus on implementing change through workforce observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes.
 
Importantly during 2020, our focus on providing a positive work environment on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. We believe these actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.
