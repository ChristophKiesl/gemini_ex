BUSINESS

 
  Overview
  
 TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”) is a global provider of infection prevention and decontamination products and services, focused primarily on life sciences, including healthcare, bio-safety, pharmaceutical, clean-room and research. We provide environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface decontamination through the sale of equipment, services and licensing of our SteraMist™ Binary Ionization Technology® (“BIT™”), which is a hydrogen peroxide-based mist and fog registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our mission is to help our customers create a healthier world through our product line and our motto is “innovating for a safer world” for healthcare and life.
  
 Introduced commercially in June 2013, our current suite of products incorporates our BIT™ Solution and applicators, including the SteraMist™ Surface Unit and the SteraMist™ Environment System. We have expanded our SteraMist™ BIT™ Technology beyond chemical and biological warfare applications to the deactivation of problem microorganisms (including spores) in a wide variety of commercial settings. SteraMist™ BIT™ provides fast-acting biological deactivation and works in hard-to-reach areas, while leaving no residue or noxious fumes.
  
 We currently target domestic and international markets for the control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and small indoor space for biological pathogens and chemical agents including infectious diseases in hospital, bio-secure labs, pharmaceutical, biodefense, biosafety including isolation and transfer chambers, tissue banks, food safety and many other commercial and residential settings.
  
  Our Technology
  
 BIT™ was developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals. ROS cause damage to pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, molds spores, other fungi and yeast, via mechanisms such as oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, leading to cellular disruption and/or dysfunction. As such, our BIT™ is able to quickly and effectively kill pathogenic organisms in the air and on surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water (in the form of humidity).

 Testing detailed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense demonstrates these ROS, which include the hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radicals, aggressively break the double bonds in bacterial spores, biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after passing our EPA-registered solution through our high energy atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result of which is our “OH” hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (“AIHP”). This patented process allows these reactive oxygen species (“ROS’s”) such as hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity.
  
 BIT™ uses a low percentage Hydrogen Peroxide as its only active ingredient to produce a hydroxyl radical (OH ion) and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist™ brand of products, which produce a germ-killing aerosol that behaves like a gas.
  
 SteraMist™ has been used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Clostridium difficile (“C. diff”) spores, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”) and Ebola Virus Disease (“Ebola”). In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist™ is being used in terminal cleans, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of C. diff spore rates. SteraMist™ has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the largest hospital in Panama, contributed to the control of MERS in South Korea and, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, TOMI’s technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. In May 2015, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded us a grant in the amount of $559,000 for the development of SteraMist™ Mobile Decontamination Chambers to fight Ebola. In May 2016, upon the decontamination and decommissioning of an Ebola treatment center in West Africa, we fully achieved the milestones upon which the grant was conditioned. Additionally, BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.
  
 Independent lab testing, study data from international pharmaceutical companies and field clinical data have shown six-log efficacy, which is a 99.9999% kill, in both C. diff spores and against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is a laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles.
  
 Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we are required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of pesticides. In June 2015, SteraMist™ BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist™ BIT™ holds EPA registrations both as a hospital-healthcare and general disinfectant (EPA Registration 90150-2) and for mold control and air and surface remediation (EPA Registration 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include the bacterias C. diff and MRSA, as well as the virus h1n1, which has better positioned us to penetrate the hospital-healthcare and other industries. We currently have our EPA-registered label in all 50 states with the addition of California and New York in July and October 2016, respectively.
  
 In September 2016, the Company’s SteraMist™ BIT™ technology passed good laboratory practice (“GLP”) tests in efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. The Company also passed testing against Tuberculosis (“TB”). The GLP studies have been submitted to the EPA for addition to our existing hospital-healthcare disinfectant label.
  
 SteraMist™ is easily incorporated into current cleaning procedures; is economical, non-corrosive and easy to apply; leaves no residues; and requires no wiping. All our SteraMist™ products are fully validated to comply with good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) standard, have received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our solution is manufactured at an EPA-registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by GLP efficacy data for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mold spores, MRSA, h1n1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and C. diff spores. As of January 27, 2017, our BIT™ solution and BIT™ technology is one of 33 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List.
  
 We continue to pursue additional opportunities to further expand the use of BIT™ in other applications. In July 2015, we entered into a materials transfer agreement with the US Agriculture Research Service (“ARS”) to conduct food safety research using AIHP or SteraMist™ BIT™. In 2016, we registered and listed SteraMist™ as a disinfectant, medical device with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are seeking registration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) as a product to be utilized in the medical device sterilization field, food packaging, preservation and food safety industries. Additionally, in 2016, we also successfully passed EPA protocols testing for Salmonella, which we believe will further support our application for use of SteraMist™ BIT™ in food safety applications.

  Intellectual Property
  
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies. We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
  
 As part of our intellectual property protection strategy, we have registered our BIT™ solution with the EPA and successfully obtained a CE mark in the EEA.
  
 As of  December 31, 2016, we held 4 United States patents and 16 foreign patents and had 4 pending United States design patent applications. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country.
  
 Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 10 trademark registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries.
  
 We also maintain internal non-disclosure safeguards, including the execution of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and others.

SteraMist™ Service Technician


 
 Domestically, we are focused on the health care and hospital, bio-safety and pharmaceutical markets, along with other verticals that are covered through our professional service division. Internationally, we seek strategic partners, manufacturer representatives or licensed distribution partners and are currently focused on Asia, the European Union, the Middle East, Central America and Mexico. In such international markets, our technologies are used for the control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and small indoor spaces for biological pathogens and chemical agents, including infectious diseases in hospitals, bio-secure labs and pharmaceutical manufacturers, biodefense and biosafety facilities (including isolation and transfer chambers), tissue banks, food safety and many other commercial and residential settings. Our marketing and strategic partnership agreements have focused on Singapore, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, particularly in light of past MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics.
  
  Manufacturing
  
 We outsource the manufacturing of our SteraMist™ line of equipment. In October 2014, we entered into a manufacturing and development agreement with RG Group, Inc. (“RG Group”), which we amended and restated in November 2016. Our agreement does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and has a two-year term, subject to extensions thereof. Our agreement provides for a warranty against product defects for one year from the date we ship the product manufactured thereunder. RG Group is an ISO9001 registered company with facilities in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.
 Industries
  
 We believe that our technology, services and products offer a significant opportunity to help reduce the spread to patients and others of Community Associated and Healthcare-Associated Infections (“HAI”). HAIs are one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) has noted that HAIs are a major, yet often preventable, threat to patient safety. As of March 2009, HAIs had a direct cost to the healthcare system of approximately $35 to $45 billion dollars annually and approximately 10% of inpatients contract infections from hospitals, resulting in more than 2,000,000 illnesses and over 100,000 deaths per year (or 1 in every 25 admissions). Further, it has been estimated that approximately 15% of all discharged hospital patients are readmitted with infections. Traditional cleaning has been known to leave 30% to 60% of pathogens behind. Additionally, a well-known study from 55 New England hospitals concluded that 25% of operating room surfaces are left unclean. The rapid turnover rate of hospital rooms, treatment rooms, hotel rooms and mass transportation, combined with the ability of bacteria to mutate and form drug resistant bacteria, present a substantial challenge to manual cleaning of such spaces, such as the use of surface chlorine wipes.
  
 Our BIT™ has safely and effectively produced a six-log efficacy, which is a 99.9999% reduction. In comparison to most of its competitors, we believe that SteraMist™ technology has a quicker and higher kill level in a shorter time and leaves no residue, is not affected by humidity, is not caustic, does not blister painted surfaces, contains no silver ions, requires no humidity alteration prior to or after use, has a shorter exposure time, and is quicker to exhaust due to the production of our reactive oxygen species (AIHP), “OH”, verses nebulization of higher concentrates of hydrogen peroxide, such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (“VHP”) and hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) type products. Our “OH” is a small 2 to 4 micron particle that contains no bleach, and rooms require little or no preparation prior to treatment. When our “OH” is finished killing, inactivating and neutralizing bacteria, bacteria spores, fungi, viruses and certain chemical agents, it converts to oxygen and water.

  ●
 blood banks

  ●
 food safety industry

  ●
 athletic facilities

  ●
 airlines

  ●
 entertainment

  ●
 homeland defense and border protection

 We intend to generate and support research on improving, extending and applying our patents. We have received interest, both domestically and internationally, in forming business alliances with major healthcare companies, biosafety labs, tissue and blood labs, pharmaceutical companies and food safety companies, as well as companies in the border protection industry, including homeland defense companies, construction companies and remediation companies.
  
  Marketing and Distribution
  
 Through our sales and services, our business growth objective is to be a global leader in disinfection and decontamination, including domestic and international infectious disease control. We hope to achieve this through our premier platform of hydrogen peroxide mists and fogs, as well as other infectious control products and technologies. We intend to continue to expand and support research and development on other decontamination and remediation solutions, including hydroxyl radicals and other ROS, and to form more business alliances. Our strategy involves licensing of our technology and/or performing decontamination services within cleanrooms, bio-safety labs, tissue and blood labs, pharmaceutical labs, kidney dialysis centers, major remediation companies, construction companies and corporations specializing in disaster relief.
  
 We sell our products domestically through our internal sales force, as well as independent sales and manufacturing representatives. Internationally, our products are sold through exclusive and non-exclusive sales representatives and distributors. We have shipped our BIT™ Technology into 20 different countries throughout Europe, North America, Central America and Asia.
  
  Market Segments
  
 Hospitals. We are seeking to expand our penetration of the hospital market segment. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, hospitals that have high rates of infections and HAIs now face significant penalties. We believe that our SteraMist™ BIT™ technology reduces the spread of infections and HAIs in patient rooms, infectious disease rooms and operatory suites, with a corresponding return on investment to the hospital of up to 20 to 1 in the first year. At this time, we cannot predict the effect of any potential healthcare reform legislation, including the potential repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on such penalties or our business and prospects in the hospital market segment.

 Bio-safety Labs, Tissue and Blood Labs and Cleanrooms. Bio-safety labs, tissue and blood labs and cleanrooms are subject to transfer risks and constantly seek to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious or potentially infectious agents or materials. We believe that the use of SteraMist™ as a routine decontamination product in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices may reduce the risk of such contamination, while also reducing potential negative effects that can result from other decontamination products, such as VHP, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and titanium dioxide, including blistering of paints, corrosion of metals, lengthy exposure times and potential carcinogenic exposure.
  
 There are many requirements and restrictions on the type of decontamination agents such labs may use to prevent these risks and remediate adverse incidents. In light of these regulations, we believe our rapid deployment of effective aerosolized reactive oxygen species could become the solution to lower risks and perform decontamination clean-up in these labs. Our product works within minutes and leaves no noxious chemical smell behind.
  
 We also believe that our products and technology can aid in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices, on all safety equipment, transfer hoods, isolation chambers, animal cages and other equipment, as well as help prevent the risks associated with handling infectious microorganisms. Our BIT™ technology has recently been successfully tested to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and level 4 (BSL-4) standards, including animal research cages. Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) is appropriate for agents with a known potential for aerosol transmission, for agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal infections and that are indigenous or exotic in origin. Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols and for which no treatment is available are restricted to high containment laboratories that meet biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) standards. SteraMist™ not only decontaminates spaces in minutes but also decontaminates the animal cages in minutes which helps in the prevention of the spread of diseases that are typically found within these research animal cages.
  
 Food Safety Industry. We believe that SteraMist™ can also serve as an effective decontaminant in the food safety industry. According to the CDC, 80 million people per year in the United States contract, and 5,000 people die from, food poisoning or other food-related illnesses. Current food safety cleaning techniques involve time intensive processes, which can reduce food manufacturers’ profit. Our AIHP degrades into only harmless water and oxygen. If we are able to successfully obtain approval by the FDA and USDA, we anticipate that our solution can be applied to all foods and all food packing and storage equipment, and believe it would be safe for use on electronics and kitchenware, along with high touch surfaces where most pathogens are found (such as phones, computers and kitchen appliances). We believe that SteraMist™ could be useful for decontamination at all phases of food production, from the farm, slaughterhouse, packaging and canning facilities, to the transportation of food and to the restaurants and grocery stores.
  
 Remediation Industry. Generally, a professional, certified remediation company waits until an emergency or disaster occurs before they can earn fees. We have implemented and plan to expand our certification, license and equipment program throughout the United States, which allows such disaster professionals to earn fees by performing surface remediation and infectious disease control in addition to their emergency response-related work. As there are over 20,000 certified professional remediators in the United States, we are aggressively targeting this market. Our service division, the TOMI Service Network (“TSN”), resulted from the demand for our product nationally. Currently, over 59 national companies are licensed to use our products and solutions. We recently approved the design of a TOMI van which has become available to those of our national service team companies who are licensed TSN members.
 
  
 Biodefense Industry. Countries around the world, including the United States, need to protect their borders and cities against a potential terrorist attack. We believe that our SteraMist™ line of products may give governmental bodies an added tool in their arsenal to mitigate the risk of a weaponized biological attack. In addition, SteraMist™ could assist in mitigating the spread of emerging pandemic viruses, including strains of Ebola, MERS, h1n1, h5n1, h7n9 and h10n8. In addition, we believe our SteraMist™ line of products may assist border patrol agents in controlling the spread of infectious disease introduced by foreign individuals by decontaminating interview rooms, containment rooms and holding cells after a potential infected carrier’s condition either improves or the carrier dies.

 Hospitality. Our products can be used for air remediation and surface cleaning, including remote controls, chairs, telephones, toilet seats and hard-to-reach areas, which would allow hospitality professionals (such as hotels and motels) to offer cleaner rooms and common areas to guests and others.
  
  TOMI Service Network (TSN)
  
 In 2015, we launched the TSN, which allowed us to enhance our service division by creating a national service network composed of existing, full service restoration industry specialists. Since the launch of the TSN, we have recruited and entered into licensing agreements with 59 geographically and strategically-placed companies that will become network hubs to take advantage of our SteraMist™ platform of products, assist as service providers for our domestic and international client base and provide regional, national and international large event mobilization response. In the first quarter of 2016, we hired a President and Director of Network Recruitment for the TSN, which has contributed to the growth of the TSN in 2016.
  
  Competition
  
 The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is extremely competitive. Our competitors include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide-based products, such as Steris Corporation (“Steris”), Bioquell, Inc. (“Bioquell”), Sanosil Ltd (“Sanosil”) and The Clorox Company (“Clorox”), various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. We believe our SteraMist suite of products have a competitive advantage in that they have a shorter kill time, provide a six log kill to a wide variety of pathogens and leave no residue or unpleasant odor. However, these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the service. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the remediation industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 Competitive Advantages
  
 SteraMist™ offers the following competitive advantages:
  
  ●
 Provides a 99.9999% or six-log kill (i.e. the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores) on all challenged pathogens, including Geobacillus stearothermophilus, the spore that is considered a gold standard for validation of sterilization versus household/industrial cleaners that offer a 99.9%, or three-log, kill to 99.99%, or four-log, kill.
