Item 1. Business.
Overview
Arconic Corporation ("Arconic" or the "Company") is a global leader in manufacturing aluminum sheet, plate, extrusions and architectural products, serving primarily the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial, and packaging end markets. We maintain a leadership position in our targeted markets through our global footprint of 22 primary manufacturing facilities, as well as various sales and service facilities, located across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. 
Arconic was previously a part of Arconic Inc., which was renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. on April 1, 2020 in connection with the separation described below under “--The Separation Transaction.” Arconic Inc. was previously part of Alcoa Inc. (renamed Arconic Inc. in 2016).
The Separation Transaction
On April 1, 2020, Arconic completed its separation from Arconic Inc. and became an independent, publicly traded company. Arconic’s business includes the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations that were formerly part of ParentCo. Howmet continues to own its engine products, engineered structures, fastening systems, and forged wheels operations. The separation occurred by means of a pro rata distribution by ParentCo of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Arconic to ParentCo common stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020. Specifically, ParentCo common stockholders received one share of Arconic common stock for every four shares of ParentCo common stock held as of March 19, 2020 and cash in lieu of fractional shares.
Upon completion of the distribution, Arconic and Howmet became separate companies with separate management teams and separate boards of directors. Prior to the distribution, Arconic and ParentCo entered into a separation agreement. In connection with the separation, we entered into various other agreements to (i) implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies; (ii) govern the relationship between Arconic and Howmet after the completion of the separation; and (iii) allocate between Arconic and Howmet various assets, liabilities, and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic On Our Business
For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Part II. Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including under the captions "Management Review of 2020 and Outlook for the Future" and "COVID-19 Pandemic."
Description of the Business
Our Portfolio
We manage our business operations through three reportable segments: Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems ("BCS") and Extrusions. We strive to make our portfolio of facilities among the most operationally efficient in the industry. We are well positioned in attractive markets, and our long-term contracts with customers enhance the strength and stability of our business and our earnings. We believe our extensive manufacturing experience and our commitment to quality and innovation have put us in a leadership position among our primary competitors. 
Rolled Products
Rolled products are used in the production of finished goods ranging from automotive body panels and airframes to industrial plate and brazing sheet. Sheet and plate are used extensively in the transportation industries as well as in building and construction and packaging. They are also used for industrial applications such as tooling plate for the production of plastic products.
Our Rolled Products segment produces a range of aluminum sheet and plate products for the following markets:
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Ground Transportation — provides specialty aluminum sheet and plate products, including auto body sheet, structural reinforcement, proprietary heat exchanger products like multilayer brazing sheet, trailer and cab structures, vehicle components and sheet for fuel tanks.
Aerospace — supplies a wide range of highly differentiated sheet and plate products that meet strict quality requirements for aerospace applications, including polished fuselage sheet, structural parts, aluminum-lithium stringers, and wing skins.
Industrial — supplies a diverse range of industrial solutions for applications that include mold and tooling plate for semiconductors; general engineering/machinery and injection molding applications; specialty finishes for appliances, cosmetic packaging and RVs; tread plate/sheet for toolbox and flooring applications; and circles for cookware.
Building and Construction — supplies a wide range of products serving both the commercial and residential end markets, including roofing, architectural composite panels, ventilated facades and ceiling panels, spacers, culvert pipes and gutters.
Packaging — serves the packaging market in Europe and Asia through regional facilities located in Russia and China.  The Company’s non-compete with Alcoa Corporation expired on October 31, 2020 and the Company has initiated a re-entry into the packaging market in North America, with efforts underway to increase can sheet capacity at select facilities and to engage in qualification runs. We do not expect the North American packaging market to contribute significantly to our results until 2022. 
Rolled Products — Competitive Conditions
Our Rolled Products segment is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled markets in which it participates, including ground transportation (including brazing sheet), aerospace, industrial and packaging markets. While Rolled Products participates in markets where we believe we have a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy, advanced manufacturing capability, unique technology and/or differentiated products, in certain cases, our competitors are capable of making products similar to our products. We continuously work to maintain and enhance our competitive position through innovation: new alloys such as high-formability automotive alloys, aluminum lithium aerospace alloys, differentiated products such as our 5-layer brazing products and break-through processes such as A951™ bonding technology.
Some of our Rolled Products markets are global and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these markets by competitors varies. Additionally, there are a number of new competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. We expect that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs.

(2)    In February 2019, we announced an investment of approximately $100 million to expand our hot mill capability and add downstream equipment capabilities to manufacture industrial and automotive aluminum products in our Alcoa, Tennessee facility. This project began in early 2019 and was essentially complete at the end of 2020.
Building and Construction Systems
Our Building and Construction Systems segment manufactures differentiated products and building envelope solutions, including entrances, curtain walls, windows, composite panel and coil coated sheet. The business operates in two markets: architectural systems, which carry the Kawneer® brand, and architectural products, which carry the Reynobond® and Reynolux® brands. The BCS segment has competitive positions in both markets, attributable to its strong brand recognition, high quality products and strong relationships through the building and construction value chain.
 As the inventor of the modern storefront more than 100 years ago, our Kawneer® branded architectural systems products include windows, doors and curtain walling. Kawneer is a premium brand, known for the breadth, depth and performance of its product portfolio and is a leading manufacturer of architectural systems in North America, with an established presence in Europe. Key customers of this market segment include fabricators and glazing subcontractors.
The Reynobond and Reynolux brands deliver innovative exterior and interior cladding and coil coated sheet solutions with end uses that include building façades, retail, sign and display, interior applications and various industrial applications. Reynobond is composite material that consists of an extruded core that is fused between two sheets of coil-coated aluminum and Reynolux is coil-coated aluminum sheet that can be sold in coil or flat-sheet form. Key customers include metal fabricators and installers.
BCS differentiates itself through its global footprint and by offering a broad portfolio of building envelope products that span the range of building end-use and building complexities. Architects, general contractors and fabricators consider BCS a go-to provider of products that are offered as systems and are localized to address functional and building code requirements. We believe that our products and systems have a reputation for quality and reliability. 
Building and Construction Systems — Competitive Conditions
In North America, our BCS segment primarily competes in the nonresidential building segment. In Europe, it competes in both the residential and nonresidential building segments. Our competitive advantage is based on strong brands, innovative products, customer intimacy and technical services.
In the architectural systems market, we compete with regional competitors like Apogee, YKK, and Oldcastle in North America and Schüco, Hydro/SAPA and Reynaers in Europe. The competitive landscape in the architectural systems market has been relatively stable since the mid-2000s, with the major competitors in North America and Europe remaining constant, despite some industry consolidation in North America during the late 2000s. 
The primary product categories in architectural products are aluminum composite material and coil coated sheet. The market for our architectural products business is more global and primarily served by subsidiaries of larger companies like Alpolic (Mitsubishi Corporation), Alucobond (Schweiter Technologies) and Novelis (Aditya Birla Group).

End Market and Customer Revenues
We provide products to customers in a number of end markets, and the revenues from any end market may vary from year to year. For more information regarding revenues by major end markets served, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." In addition, the demand for products in certain end markets is concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. We have multi-year contracts with many of our key customers, primarily in the aerospace and ground transportation end markets. These contracts indirectly expose us to changes in these customers' end markets, and the loss of sales under these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business if such sales are not replaced by sales to other customers. 
Customer and Distribution Channel
Rolled Products and Extrusions
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments have two primary sales channels: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.
Direct Sales
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments supply various customers all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated customers and OEMs, but can also service medium and small size customers as well. Long-standing relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled and extruded products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. As the manufacture of higher content aluminum vehicles continues to grow, we continue to develop long-term relationships with the automotive OEMs. In some cases, the products we supply are proprietary in nature. Further, certain industries, such as automotive and aerospace, and their related customers require suppliers to complete a rigorous qualification process. The ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications is an important part of doing business in these segments. A customer’s cost to switch and either find a new product or qualify a new supplier can be significant, so it is in both the customer’s and the supplier’s best interest to maintain these relationships.
Distributors
Our Rolled Products and Extrusions segments also sell their products through third-party distributors. Customers of distributors are typically widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are usually highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use segments in smaller quantities.
Building and Construction Systems
Our Building and Construction Systems segment supplies architectural facade systems and products principally in North America and Europe but also globally through both direct sales and distributors. Its typical customers are installers or fabricators who purchase product on a project-by-project basis. Long-standing relationships are maintained with its leading customers. BCS 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

also maintains an e-commerce platform for numerous standard architectural products for use by its North American customers and offers standard architectural products for purchase in its service centers.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Important raw materials used by Arconic are: primary aluminum for remelting (sows, t-bars, and ingots, including high purity and off-grade), aluminum alloyed and unalloyed casthouse products (including rolling slab and billet), aluminum scrap, alloying materials (including, but not limited to, magnesium, copper, and zinc), aluminum coil, electricity, natural gas, coatings, lube oil, packaging materials, and resin. Generally, other materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. We believe that the raw materials necessary to the Arconic businesses are and will continue to be available.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our domestic and international intellectual property assets provide us with a significant competitive advantage, as we continue to strive to improve our products and processes. Our rights under our patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to us as a whole, and to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by us generally concern metal alloys, particular products, manufacturing equipment or techniques. Our business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trademark or other intellectual property. As a result of product development and technological advancement, we continue to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2020, our worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 475 granted patents and 200 pending patent applications.  Patent terms extend for varying periods based on the filing date or the grant date in the various countries where we have or have applied for patent protection. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country, with the most significant variations relating to the scope of patent protection and the legal remedies available. 
With respect to domestic and foreign trademarks, we have many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Arconic” and the Arconic symbol for aluminum products, Kawneer for building panels, and Reynobond and Reynolux for architectural products. As of December 31, 2020, our worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 900 registered trademarks and 200 pending trademark applications. Our rights under our trademarks are important to us as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in others for as long as it remains registered. Registration generally are periodically renewable for additional fixed terms.
Research and Development
We engage in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. The Arconic Technology Center (ATC), located in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, serves as the headquarters for our research and development efforts, with additional research and development facilities in Norcross, Georgia, Runcorn, United Kingdom, Vendargues, France, and Harderwijk, Netherlands. These facilities focus on innovation and have given us a leading position in the development of proprietary next-generation specialty alloys and manufacturing processes as evidenced by our robust intellectual property portfolio.
Government Regulations 
As a global company, our business is subject to government regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe we are materially compliant with all applicable government laws and regulations, and maintaining compliance, other than as noted below, is not expected to materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Any new or amended laws or regulations that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements may negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. Additional information is included in Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Our operations are subject to national, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, chemical usage and workplace safety requirements and protocols.  We maintain a global environmental, health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and procedures; dedicated environmental, health and safety personnel; appropriate handling of waste materials and hazardous materials; monitoring, reporting and remediating environmental, health, and safety issues; compliance auditing; and training, among other measures. 
Approved capital expenditures for new or existing facilities for environmental control are approximately $13 million for 2021. Additional information relating to environmental matters is included in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements included 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

in Part II. Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under the caption “Contingencies and Commitments — Contingencies - Environmental Matters.”
Other than the foregoing, we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 related to compliance with environmental or other government regulations.
Human Capital Resources
At Arconic, we are committed to living our core values by protecting and improving the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment. We cultivate an inclusive and diverse culture that advocates for equity, acts with integrity, and upholds high standards for human rights. We strengthen our global workforce by providing learning opportunities, employee engagement programs and talent development efforts that drive innovation, agility, people development and collaboration.
Our worldwide employment at the end of 2020 was approximately 13,400 employees located in 20 countries. The breakdown of our employees by region is as follows:

Region | Percentage of Total Population
Americas | 57% 
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 37% 
Asia | 6% 

Turnover
In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company initiated significant cost savings efforts, which included a workforce restructuring, temporary salary reductions and a suspension of the Company’s matching contributions to the 401(k). During 2020, the Company’s employee base was reduced by approximately 2,000, largely due to cost-saving initiatives and strategic dispositions, resulting in a distorted employee turnover rate.
Collective Bargaining Representation
We believe in freedom of association. We respect an individual’s choice to be represented by – or not be represented by – a union or other legally authorized associations or organizations in accordance with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions. We believe that relations with our employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good. In the United States, approximately 3,600 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest collective bargaining agreement is the master collective bargaining agreement between us and the United Steelworkers (“USW”). The USW master agreement covers approximately 3,000 employees at four U.S. locations. The current labor agreement expires on May 15, 2022. There are seven other collective bargaining agreements in the United States with varying expiration dates. On a regional basis, there are agreements between Arconic and unions with varying expiration dates that cover employees in Europe, Russia, North America, South America, and Asia.
Governance
Following the separation, the Board of Directors expanded the responsibilities of our Compensation and Benefits Committee to include the oversight of talent management, which includes (i) talent management strategies, such as the Company’s recruitment, development, promotion and retention programs; (ii) policies and practices promoting diversity and inclusion within the Company; and (iii) key metrics and objectives related to the Company’s talent. Our Board of Directors is also committed to our talent management and has retained direct oversight responsibilities for the Company’s succession plan, its environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy and our safety practices.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are dedicated to maintaining an environment where everyone feels valued, and we celebrate both the differences and similarities among our people. We also believe that diversity in all areas, including cultural background, experience and thought, is essential in making our Company stronger. The breakdown of our female and ethnic minority employees globally, as members of management and as executives is as follows:
TABLE OF CONTENTS


 | Total % | Management % | Executive %
Women | 20.5% | 22.1% | 37.5% 
Minorities | 21.2% | 12.4% | 20.2% 

 1 Percentages are on a global basis
 2 Percentages are on a U.S. basis only
 3 Represents members of management, other than executives
 4 Represents our executive leaders who serve in a Vice President or higher role

Following the separation, we established an Inclusion and Diversity Council chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and revitalized our six employee resource groups (“ERGs”) with executives volunteering as executive sponsors for each group, and the key leadership positions in each ERG have been newly appointed. Our six ERGs – Arconic African Heritage Network, Arconic Hispanic Network, Arconic Next Generation Network, Arconic Veterans Network, Thrive Network (Women) and Spectrum (LGBTQ+) – reflect an inclusive, respectful and values-based company culture. All of our employees are encouraged to participate in these grassroots, employee-led organizations that: 
•Drive employee engagement through community outreach around science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education; 
•Provide learning and development opportunities for employees; 
•Help position Arconic as a global employer of choice through strategic recruiting activities;
•Inform Company policies around diversity and inclusion; and 
•Reinforce our brand through key external endorsements like the Human Rights Campaign and Catalyst.
In 2020, we launched a Grow Together Inclusion and Diversity awareness campaign to kick-off our long-term initiative to support inclusion, diversity and social justice through leadership sponsorship and employee engagement worldwide. The campaign encouraged employees to take actions related to inclusion, diversity or social justice through learning activities, volunteering and donating to any non-profit organization with a social equity mission that were recommended by our ERGs. At the conclusion of the campaign, Arconic employees had exceeded the original goal, logging more than 2,200 actions, which included approximately 1,500 education actions, 260 volunteering actions, and more than $100,000 in personal donations to nonprofits of their choice. As a result, the Arconic Foundation, an independently endowed foundation and the charitable arm of the Company, granted each of the six selected organizations $60,000, for a total of $360,000.
Talent Development
We are committed to enabling employees and next-generation leaders to reach their goals through strategic planning, training and leadership development. We support the businesses and resource units throughout our integrated approach, that we call the People Experience program, which starts at recruitment and continues throughout career development, advancement and succession planning to enable our people to perform successfully. We offer various resources to support employees in achieving and enhancing their development objectives. We provide learning and development opportunities and equip our leaders with the skills and tools to provide ongoing coaching and feedback so employees can maximize their performance and potential, delivering success for Arconic and the individual.
Health and Safety 
We value human life above all else and are committed to operating worldwide in a safe, responsible manner which respects the environment and the health of our employees, our customers and the communities where we operate. Our strong health and safety culture empowers our employees and contractors to take personal responsibility for their actions and the safety of their coworkers. Our focus on safety also includes an ongoing commitment to maintaining a secure work environment that respects the dignity and worth of every employee, which drives our continuous improvement approach in our robust safety programs. Our employees play an important role in actively supporting a workplace that is free of violence, threats, intimidation, and harassment. This culture is supported by internal policies, standards, rules and procedures that clearly articulate our stringent expectations for working safely and maintaining a secure work environment in all of our facilities worldwide.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. We established strict requirements for onsite work that is continually assessed against the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and other expert guidance to assure that we are providing a safe work environment. For all positions that were not required to be onsite, we implemented work from home protocols and encouraged the use of technology to support our collaborative work environment.
During 2020, we had zero employee and contractor fatalities, which was the fifth consecutive year that we achieved this important milestone. We are committed to continuing to achieve zero fatalities and keeping fatality prevention as a major focus. We have conducted our annual fatality assessments for each location remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have

prioritized our risk management processes toward fatality and serious injury potential to focus on the most impactful hazards that have the potential for life-altering outcomes. In addition, during 2020, all of our key safety rates remained significantly below the most recent U.S. industry averages. At 0.55, our 2020 days away, restricted and transfer (“DART”) was 3% lower than our 2019 DART of 0.57. Our 2020 total recordable incident rate (“TRR”) of 0.95 (recorded in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements) was 23% lower than our 2019 TRR of 1.24.
