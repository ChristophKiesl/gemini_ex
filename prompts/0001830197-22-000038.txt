Item 1. Business 
Company Overview
We are a leading residential mortgage originator and servicer driven by a mission to create financially healthy, happy homeowners. We do this by delivering scale, efficiency and savings to our partners and customers. Our business model is focused on leveraging a nationwide network of partner relationships to drive sustainable origination growth. We support our origination operations through a robust operational infrastructure and a highly responsive customer experience. We then leverage our servicing platform to manage the customer experience. We believe that the complementary relationship between our origination and servicing businesses allows us to provide a best-in-class experience to our customers throughout their homeownership lifecycle.
Our primary focus is our Wholesale channel, which is a business-to-business-to-customer distribution model in which we utilize our relationships with independent mortgage brokerages, which we refer to as our Broker Partners, to reach our end-borrower customers. In this channel, while our Broker Partners establish and maintain the relationship with the end-borrower, we as the lender underwrite the loan in-house and act as the original lender. This differentiates our Wholesale channel from our other two channels of mortgage origination: in our Direct channel, we as the lender engage with the end-borrower customers directly to originate mortgages, and in our Correspondent channel, we as the lender engage with original lenders, which we refer to as our Correspondent Partners, to purchase loans already issued to end-borrower customers.
According to Inside Mortgage Finance, we are the third largest wholesale lender by origination volume for the year ended December 31, 2021. Through our Wholesale channel, we propel the success of our more than 8,000 Broker Partners through a combination of full service, localized sales coverage and an efficient loan fulfillment process supported by our fully integrated technology platform. We differentiate ourselves from our peers focused on the wholesale channel by following a partnership approach towards our Broker Partners, where we seek to mitigate any conflict of interest by allowing the Broker Partners to maintain their customer relationships while we support them with our best-in-class technology platform. Broker Partners, which we define to include brokerage businesses that may include multiple broker employees, represent wholesale and non-delegated correspondent accounts that Home Point is authorized to conduct business with at a given point in time (whether or not we have recently originated mortgages through such broker).
Our growth is evidenced by an increased share of the wholesale channel of the U.S. residential mortgage market. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, our market share in the wholesale channel was 9.8% in 2021 compared to 1.6% in 2017. This growth trend, together with our distinct wholesale strategy, enable highly scalable production volumes, a strong mix of purchase transactions and favorable unit economics, driven by lower fixed costs.
Our Wholesale strategy further propels our growth, with total loan originations of $69.5 billion through our Broker Partner network in 2021, compared to total loan originations of $96.2 billion across all channels in 2021. 
While we initiate our customer relationships at the time the mortgage is originated, we maintain ongoing connectivity with our nearly 442,000 servicing customers, with the ultimate objective of securing them as a Customer for Life. Our retention strategy and partnership model has differentiated us from our competitors and is a key driver of our continued growth and investment in the wholesale channel. 
In February 2022, we announced an agreement with ServiceMac, LLC (“ServiceMac”), a wholly owned subsidiary of First American Financial Corporation, pursuant to which ServiceMac will subservice all mortgage loans underlying MSRs we hold. ServiceMac is expected to begin subservicing loans for us in the second quarter of 2022. Once ServiceMac begins subservicing loans for us, they will perform servicing functions on our behalf, but we will continue to hold the MSRs. The transition of our servicing operation to ServiceMac will enable the redeployment of technology and process resources to support the growth of our Wholesale channel, including expanding product offerings and enhancing the partner experience. In addition, ServiceMac will continue to enable support of our broker-driven customer retention efforts, keeping them connected through our Customer For Life program. Strategically retaining the servicing on our originations gives us the opportunity to establish productive relationships with our customers. We anticipate that the opportunity for productive relationships with our customers will continue after ServiceMac begins subservicing loans for us since customers will receive the same high-quality service they are accustomed to and they will continue to see our brand on all communications. We expect that our relationship with ServiceMac will allow us to maintain a lower, more variable cost structure and provide greater flexibility when strategically selling certain non-core MSRs. 
 We have built a flexible technology infrastructure that is highly componentized, which we believe allows us to leverage nimble internal development teams and market leading third-party systems to provide a best-in-class experience for our partners and customers. We believe that our ability to rapidly reconfigure individual solutions using technology in areas such as underwriting, pricing and disclosure preparation reduces the complexity and improves the efficiency of the origination process. 
These efforts have resulted in growth in our originations. As we continue to grow, we believe the scalability of our partner-driven business model will produce significant operating leverage and increased profitability. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our Business
Our business model is focused on growing originations by leveraging a network of partner relationships that we support through reliable loan origination infrastructure and a highly responsive customer experience. Our operations are organized into two separate reportable segments: Origination and Servicing.
Origination
We originate mortgages in three distinct channels—our Wholesale channel, our Correspondent channel and our Direct channel. We choose to operate in these channels because we believe that together they:
•provide us efficient access to both purchase and refinance transactions throughout market cycles;
•benefit from the premise that in-market advisors will continue to be a cornerstone of the mortgage origination process;
•are highly scalable and flexible; and
•provide an optimized experience for our customers.
In each of these channels, our primary source of revenue consists of (i) gains on loans, which is the difference between the cost of originating or purchasing the mortgage loans and the price at which we sell such loans to investors, primarily the GSEs and Ginnie Mae, and (ii) gains on fair value of MSRs.
Our originations are comprised of both purchase and refinance originations. While refinancing origination levels in the market vary based on a number of market dynamics, including interest rate levels, inflation, unemployment and the strength of the overall economy, we are focused on maintaining steady growth in our purchase origination volumes, which gives us a considerable advantage over our competitors as purchase originations tend to be more stable and reduce earnings volatility. In 2020, our purchase origination mix was 30.9%. In 2021, the higher interest rate environment resulted in a slight increase in purchase origination mix to 31.1%. However, we maintained strong growth in our purchase origination levels, which grew 56.1% year over year. Our purchase originations grew from $19.1 billion in 2020 to $29.9 billion in 2021. 
Wholesale Channel
We originate residential mortgages in our Wholesale channel through a nationwide network of more than 8,000 Broker Partners. We are strategically focused on this channel given that the underlying cost structure is more efficient than that of Distributed retail, where the costs and overhead associated with originating loans are the responsibility of the lender. As a result, we are able to operate with a lower fixed cost than many of our competitors. This highly leverageable cost structure allows for improved financial flexibility in varying interest rate environments. 
Our Broker Partners have local and personal relationships with their customers and therefore can provide tailored and thoughtful advice. However, they do not have the underwriting, funding, distributing or servicing capabilities for these loans. We provide these resources, which allow them to operate with scale and compete against larger market participants. This can be seen through the rapid growth of our originations in this channel, which increased from $37.9 billion in 2020 to $69.5 billion in 2021. This enables our Broker Partners to be nimble and run their business in an entrepreneurial fashion. Our Broker Partners are focused on providing the best possible experience, service, and price to their customers, while we concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the origination platform leveraged by our partners. While our Broker Partners are responsible for originating the loan, we, as the lender, are responsible for making the loan. As a result, the decision to extend credit to the borrower, and the associated credit risk exposure, is our sole responsibility and not the responsibility of our Broker Partners. While we maintain policies and procedures designed to monitor the performance of our Broker Partners, we are not liable for their independent actions. 
The efficiency of our sales team, combined with our flexible cost structure, has positioned us to further consolidate volume from the smaller and less efficient wholesale lenders that still control nearly 50% of the wholesale market. We plan to do this by increasing the number of independent brokerages that serve as our Broker Partners. We believe that further penetration of the highly fragmented brokerage market will allow us to maintain our industry leading growth profile.
The strategy we employ in our Wholesale channel is closely tied to our servicing strategy. Strategically retaining the servicing on our originations gives us the opportunity to establish productive relationships with our customers. This provides us the ability to include our Broker Partners in the management of the customer relationship and ultimately the retention of customers in our collective ecosystem. We anticipate that the opportunity for productive relationships with our customers will continue after ServiceMac begins subservicing loans for us since customers will receive the same high-quality service they are accustomed to and they will continue to see our brand on all communications. In addition, the transition of our servicing operation to ServiceMac will enable the redeployment of technology and process resources to support the growth of our Wholesale channel, including expanding product offerings and enhancing the partner experience.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Correspondent Channel
In our Correspondent channel, we purchase closed and funded mortgages from a trusted network of our Correspondent Partners. Our Correspondent Partners include primarily small- to medium-sized independent mortgage banks, builder affiliates and financial institutions. Our partners underwrite, process and fund loans, but typically lack the scale to economically retain servicing. Our financial institution partners prefer to sell to non-bank originators to avoid conflicting customer solicitation. This channel provides a flexible alternative for us to achieve our customer acquisition goals at a low cost. When favorable market opportunities present themselves, the channel can quickly be scaled up. We acquired $21.9 billion in production through more than 600 Correspondent Partner relationships during 2021.
Direct Channel
In our Direct channel, we originate residential mortgages primarily for existing servicing customers who are seeking new financing options. Our Direct strategy is focused on maximizing the customer retention opportunity in our servicing portfolio, but is differentiated from our competitors in that it is designed to be inclusive of both of our customers’ preferences and our Broker Partners’ in-market presence. For example, if a Broker Partner initiated customer proactively contacts us about a refinancing, we will refer the customer to the applicable Broker Partner that originally established the relationship. This strategy removes the conflict of interest that some competitors have between their direct and wholesale channels. If the customer prefers to use our Direct functionality, or if there is no Broker Partner perhaps because the customer was sourced through a Correspondent Partner, we can still fulfill the customer’s preference and retain the customer relationship. We call this our omni-channel retention strategy.
Due to our omni-channel retention strategy, we maintain stronger Broker Partner relationships and create a key point of differentiation when winning new Broker Partners. We do not compete with our Broker Partners, but instead help them maintain their end customers when having an in-market loan originator is important. This strategy enhances our ability to grow originations and retain customers.
Strategically retaining the servicing on our originations gives us the opportunity to establish productive relationships with our customers. This also enhances efficiency for a customer’s next transaction because we have an ongoing relationship with the customer and a rich data set that can be leveraged to better the loan origination process. By striving to make the process streamlined, reliable, and focused on the customer’s preference as to who they want as their loan originator, we believe we are able to create Customers for Life. We anticipate that the opportunity for productive relationships with our customers will continue after ServiceMac begins subservicing loans for us since customers will receive the same high-quality service they are accustomed to and they will continue to see our brand on all communications.
In recent years, we have significantly increased retention rates by leveraging our data and analytics to better understand our customers’ future financing needs. This allows us to proactively monitor our customer relationships over time. 
Our Direct channel is focused on maximizing the retention opportunity of customers in our servicing portfolio. We believe that recapturing our customers is integral to our goal of creating Customers for Life. For that reason, we began building our Direct channel in 2019, and we have quickly scaled it from $2.8 billion of origination volume in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $4.9 billion in 2021. 
Our Direct channel is a key piece of our omni-channel retention strategy, which we designed to meet the needs of our customers, as well as our Broker Partners. Our retention strategy is differentiated from our competitors because it reduces the ‘channel conflict’ that exists between brokers and originators in our competitors’ strategies. 
We proactively look for opportunities to save our existing servicing customers money by identifying refinancing opportunities on their existing mortgage. Our strategy for doing this is to refer that customer back to the applicable Broker Partner that initially established the relationship. That referral creates an opportunity for our Broker Partners to generate incremental business without independently sourcing the loan. Our ability to deliver that lead to our Broker Partner allows us to build sticky, long-term relationships and add meaningful value for our Broker Partners. While a referral to our Broker Partner does not guarantee that we will ultimately originate the retained loan, we believe this strategy allows us to capture an increased share of our Broker Partner’s future business and advance our goal of maintaining Customers for Life.
In situations where the customer relationship was sourced through a Correspondent Partner, we look to originate that customer’s next loan through our Direct channel and retain the corresponding MSR. By maintaining flexibility to retain our customers through both our Broker Partners and our Direct channel, we are able to effectively execute our omni-channel retention strategy. 
Servicing
While we initiate our customer relationships at the time the mortgage is originated, we maintain ongoing connectivity with our nearly 442,000 servicing customers, with the ultimate objective of securing them as a Customer for Life. Our retention strategy and partnership model has differentiated us from our competitors and is a key driver of our continued growth and investment in the wholesale channel. Our Servicing segment is authorized to conduct business in all 50 states and D.C.

We expect that our relationship with ServiceMac will allow us to maintain a lower, more variable cost structure and provide greater flexibility when strategically selling certain non-core MSRs. 
By continuing to increase origination volumes, we have been able to grow our servicing portfolio, which enables us to generate attractive economics and benefit from scale. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 442,000 servicing portfolio customers, as compared to 360,000 at the end of 2020. During this same period, our servicing portfolio UPB increased from $91.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $133.9 billion at the end of 2021. 
Technology
Mortgage banking technology is evolving rapidly. Historically, it has been an advantage to develop technology in-house, but in today’s marketplace, there are various alternative technology solutions that provide a competitive advantage through increased flexibility and lower costs. Building and maintaining a monolithic, proprietary loan origination system is not only costly, but highly complex. This makes it increasingly challenging to evolve with emerging technologies. We have developed a multi-prong strategy whereby we (i) partner with best-in-class third-party software providers to meet our core technology needs and (ii) deploy internal resources to build proprietary software in areas where we believe we can create a strategic advantage. We integrate our third-party providers with our proprietarily built software to provide a unified, seamless experience for our partners and customers. We believe that our componentized approach promotes nimbleness and allows us to provide technology solutions faster than our competition, while retaining control in areas that we deem strategically important. 
Our servicing platform supports our customers’ home ownership journey. This is done together with third-party providers that offer a variety of products and services to our customers, including insurance, loans and other ancillary home service products. In addition to revenue generation, the successful execution of these offerings is intended to build a stronger relationship between us and our customers with the goal of retaining the customer in our ecosystem—Customers for Life.
We believe the combination of customer-centric technology and process execution is key to creating the best overall technology platform. As a result, we have placed a heavy emphasis on process design and have assembled a team of process engineers that possess a unique combination of business acumen and an understanding of how to deploy mortgage technology. This process engineering team is integrated within the operations of our business to ensure our technology solutions are strategically aligned in developing and delivering efficiencies to the business. These efficiencies promote our ability to drive scale and better serve the needs of both our customers and our partners. The dedicated focus of this team enables us to constantly identify and streamline operational areas that can be best served through technological improvement. 
U.S. Mortgage Market 
The U.S. mortgage market is one of the largest and consistently growing financial markets in the world. As of December 31, 2021, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York there was approximately $10.9 trillion of residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States. According to Fannie Mae’s Housing Forecast, total purchase and refinance originations are expected to reach nearly $3.3 trillion in 2022. Periods of outsized refinancing opportunities, such as those opportunities experienced in 2020, provide significant upside in the mortgage market, while purchase mortgages, which represent $2.0 trillion of the market of the 2022 forecast, provide stability in market volumes.
Regulation
We operate in a heavily regulated industry that is highly focused on consumer protection. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the financial services sector. We expect to continue to face regulatory scrutiny as a participant in the mortgage sector.
Our business is subject to extensive oversight and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, HUD and various state agencies that license and conduct examinations of our loan servicing, origination and collection activities. From time to time, we also receive requests from federal, state and local agencies for records, documents and information relating to the policies, procedures and practices of our loan servicing, origination and collection activities. The GSEs and Ginnie Mae, and various investors and lenders also subject us to periodic reviews and audits.

The descriptions below summarize certain significant state and federal laws to which we are subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions.
Federal, State and Local Laws and Regulations
We must comply with a large number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws and regulations including, among others:
•the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) and Regulation X, which (1) require certain disclosures to be made to the borrower at application, as to the lender’s good faith estimate of loan origination costs, and at closing with respect to the real estate settlement statement, (2) apply to certain loan servicing practices including escrow accounts, customer complaints, servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, error resolution and loss mitigation, and (3) prohibit giving or accepting any fee, kickback or a thing of a thing of value for the referral of real estate settlement services;
•The Truth In Lending Act (“TILA”), Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, and Regulation Z, which regulate mortgage loan origination activities, require certain disclosures be made to borrowers throughout the loan process regarding terms of mortgage financing, provide for a three-day right to rescind some transactions, regulate certain higher-priced and high-cost mortgages, require lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that consumers have the ability to repay the loan, mandate home ownership counseling for mortgage applicants, impose restrictions on loan originator compensation, and apply to certain loan servicing practices;
•Regulation N, which prohibits certain unfair and deceptive acts and practices related to mortgage advertising;
•certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act, which, among other things, prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;
•the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and Regulation V, which regulate the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers, require disclosures to consumers regarding the use of credit report information in certain credit decisions and require lenders to undertake remedial actions if there is a breach in the lender’s data security;
•the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics in the extension of credit and require certain disclosures to applicants for credit;
•the Homeowners Protection Act, which requires certain disclosures and the cancellation or termination of mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;
•the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, which require reporting of loan origination data, including the number of loan applications taken, approved, denied and withdrawn;
•the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics;
•the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of third-party debt collection communications;
•the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires initial and periodic communication with consumers on privacy matters and the maintenance of privacy regarding certain consumer data in our possession;
•the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or the USA PATRIOT Act, which impose certain due diligence and recordkeeping requirements on lenders to detect and block money laundering that could support terrorist or other illegal activities;
•the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (the “SAFE Act”), which imposes state licensing requirements on mortgage loan originators;
•the Military Lending Act, or MLA, which restricts, among other things, the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to active military personnel and their dependents on most types of consumer credit, requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product;
•the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which provides financial protections for eligible service members;
•the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC Credit Practices Rules and the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule, which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices and certain related practices;
•the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which restricts telephone and text solicitations and communications and the use of automatic telephone equipment;
TABLE OF CONTENTS

•the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or ESIGN, and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, which require businesses that use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions and provide required disclosures to consumers electronically, to obtain the consumer’s consent to receive information electronically;
•the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, or EFTA, and Regulation E, which protect consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers;
•the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and the FTC’s rules promulgated pursuant to such Act, or the CAN-SPAM Act, which establish requirements for certain “commercial messages” and “transactional or relationship messages” transmitted via email; and
•the Bankruptcy Code and bankruptcy injunctions and stays, which can restrict collection of debts.
In addition to applicable federal laws and regulations governing our operations, our ability to originate and service loans in any particular state is subject to that state’s laws, regulations and licensing requirements, which may differ from the laws, regulations and licensing requirements of other states. State laws often include limits on the fees and interest rates we may charge, disclosure requirements with respect to fees and interest rates and other requirements. Many states have adopted regulations that prohibit various forms of “predatory” lending and place obligations on lenders to substantiate that a customer will derive a tangible benefit from the proposed home financing transaction and/or have the ability to repay the loan. Many of these laws are vague and subject to differing interpretation, which exposes us to additional risks.
On January 1, 2020, the CCPA took effect, directly impacting our California business operations and indirectly impacting our operations nationwide. Generally speaking, the CCPA provides consumers with new privacy rights such as the right to request deletion of their data, the right to receive data on record for them, and the right to know what categories of data (generally) are maintained about them. It also mandates new disclosures prior to, and at, the point of data collection and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of such consumers. The CCPA allows consumers to submit verifiable consumer requests regarding their personal information and requires our business to implement procedures to comply with such requests. The California Attorney General issued, and subsequently updated, proposed regulations to further define and clarify the requirements of the CCPA. The impact of this law and its corresponding regulations, future enforcement activity and potential liability is unknown. At least two additional states have enacted similar laws to the CCPA, and we expect more states to follow.
These laws and regulations apply to many facets of our business, including loan origination, loan servicing, default servicing and collections, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about our customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced.
In response to COVID-19, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) imposed several new compliance obligations on our mortgage servicing activities, including, but not limited to, mandatory forbearance offerings, altered credit reporting obligations, and moratoriums on foreclosure actions and late fee assessments. Many states have taken similar measures to provide mortgage payment and other relief to consumers, which create additional complexity around our mortgage servicing compliance activities. Federal, state and local executive, legislative and regulatory responses to COVID-19 have not been consistent in scope or application, and have been subject to change without advance notice. For example, while certain foreclosure moratorium and forbearance programs have expired, other such programs have been extended. The regulatory response to COVID-19 has been characterized by rapid evolution and may continue to rapidly evolve in response to local, national or global resurgences or the emergence and spread of new variants of COVID-19.
Our failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements could lead to, without limitation, any of the following:
•loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses;
•governmental investigations and enforcement actions;
•administrative fines and penalties and litigation;
•civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities;
•breaches of covenants and representations resulting in defaults and cross-defaults under our servicing and trade agreements and financing arrangements;
•damage to our reputation;
•inability to obtain new financing and maintain existing financing;
TABLE OF CONTENTS

•inability to raise capital; or
•inability to execute on our business strategy. 
Supervision and Enforcement
Since its formation, the CFPB has taken a very active role in the mortgage industry. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage lenders and servicers, and its rulemaking and regulatory agenda relating to loan servicing and origination continues to evolve. The CFPB also has broad supervisory and enforcement powers with regard to non-depository financial institutions that engage in the origination and servicing of mortgage loans. The CFPB has conducted routine examinations of our business and will conduct future examinations.
As part of its enforcement authority, the CFPB can order, among other things, rescission or reformation of contracts, the refund of moneys or the return of real property, restitution, disgorgement or compensation for unjust enrichment, the payment of damages or other monetary relief, public notifications regarding violations, remediation of practices, external compliance monitoring and civil money penalties. The CFPB has been active in investigations and enforcement actions and has issued large civil money penalties since its inception to parties the CFPB determines violated the laws and regulations it enforces.
Individual states have also been active in the mortgage industry, as have other regulatory organizations such as the Multistate Mortgage Committee, a multistate coalition of various mortgage banking regulators. We also believe there has been a shift among certain regulators towards a broader view of the scope of regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to mortgage lenders and servicers. In addition to their traditional focus on licensing and examination matters, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to areas such as corporate governance, safety and soundness and risk and compliance management.
In addition, we receive information requests and other inquiries, both formal and informal in nature, from our state regulators as part of their general regulatory oversight of our servicing and lending businesses. 
The CFPB and state regulators have also increasingly focused on the use and adequacy of technology in the mortgage servicing industry. In 2016, the CFPB issued a special edition supervisory report that stressed the need for mortgage servicers to assess and make necessary improvements to their information technology systems to ensure compliance with the CFPB’s mortgage servicing requirements. The New York Department of Financial Services, or the NYDFS, also issued Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which took effect in 2017, and which required banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NYDFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry.
New regulatory and legislative measures, or changes in enforcement practices, including those related to the technology we use, could, either individually or in the aggregate, require significant changes to our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, negatively impact asset values or reduce our revenues.
State Licensing, State Attorneys General and Other Matters
Because we are not a depository institution, we must comply with state licensing requirements to conduct our business, and we are licensed to originate loans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We also are able to purchase and service loans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, either because we have the required licenses in such jurisdictions or are exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed to perform such activity in such jurisdictions.
Under the SAFE Act, all states have laws that require mortgage loan originators employed by non-depository institutions to be individually licensed to offer mortgage loan products. These licensing requirements require individual loan originators employed by us to register in a nationwide mortgage licensing system, submit application and background information to state regulators for a character and fitness review, submit to a criminal background check, complete a minimum of 20 hours of pre-licensing education, complete an annual minimum of eight hours of continuing education and successfully complete an examination. As a result of each license we maintain, we are subject to regulatory oversight, supervision and enforcement authority in connection with the activities that we conduct pursuant to the license, including to determine our compliance with applicable law.
We also must comply with state licensing requirements to conduct our business, and we incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these licensing requirements. Our licensed entities are required to renew their licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so they must satisfy the license renewal requirements of each jurisdiction. This generally will include financial requirements such as providing audited financial statements or satisfying minimum net worth requirements and non-financial requirements such as satisfactorily completing examinations as to the licensee’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Failure to satisfy any of the requirements to which our licensed entities are subject could result in a variety of regulatory actions such as a fine, a directive requiring a certain step to be taken, a prohibition or restriction on certain activities, a suspension of a license or ultimately a revocation of a license. Certain types of regulatory actions could limit our ability to 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

continue to conduct our business in the relevant jurisdictions or result in a breach of representations, warranties and covenants, and potentially cross-defaults in our financing arrangements which could limit or prohibit our access to liquidity to operate our business.
Competition
We compete with third-party businesses in originating forward mortgages, including other bank and non-bank financial services companies focused on one or more of these business lines. Competition in our industry can take many forms, including the variety of loan programs being made available, interest rates and fees charged for a loan, convenience in obtaining a loan, customer service levels, the amount and term of a loan, and marketing and distribution channels. Many of our competitors for forward mortgage originations are commercial banks or savings institutions. These financial institutions typically have access to greater financial resources, have more diverse funding sources with lower funding costs, are less reliant on loan sales or securitizations of mortgage loans into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity, and may be able to participate in government programs in which we are unable to participate because we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, all of which places us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our competitors seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing factors. To the extent that we match our competitors’ lower pricing, we may experience lower gain on sale margins. Fluctuations in interest rates, inflation and general economic conditions may also affect our competitive position. During periods of rising interest rates, competitors that have locked in low borrowing costs may have a competitive advantage. Furthermore, a cyclical decline in the industry’s overall level of originations, or decreased demand for loans due to a higher interest rate environment, may lead to increased competition for the remaining loans. Any increase in these competitive pressures could be detrimental to our business.
Intellectual Property
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party intellectual property, including trade secrets, unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names, and the intellectual property rights in our proprietary software, all of which we believe maintain and enhance our competitive position and protect our products. 
Cyclicality and Seasonality
The demand for loan originations is affected by consumer demand for home loans and the market for buying, selling, financing and/or re-financing residential and commercial real estate, which in turn, is affected by the national economy, regional trends, property valuations, interest rates, and socio-economic trends and by state and federal regulations and programs which may encourage and accelerate or discourage and slowdown certain real estate trends. Our business is generally subject to seasonal trends with activity generally decreasing during the winter months, especially home purchase loans and related services.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,200 full-time associates globally. None of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our associate relations to be good. Our culture and technology has allowed many of our associates (including executives and mortgage loan officers and staff) to work remotely, which has allowed us to recruit and hire top managers and executives regardless of geography and to continue our business and operations without significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic.
For additional information, please see the section titled “Human Capital” in the Company’s definitive proxy statement relating to its 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
