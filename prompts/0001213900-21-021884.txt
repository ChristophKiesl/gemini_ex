ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Currently, we are engaged in the sharing economy businesses.
 
On December 27, 2019 the Company acquires full ownership of ECrent Worldwide Company Limited to develop a global platform of P2P sharing of items and services.
 
On December 30, 2020 the Company and former shareholders of Jebe mutually agreed to terminate the Acquisition Agreement. As a result, the Company concluded it was no longer the primary beneficiary of Jebe.
 
With the market situation of the global sharing economy markets, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2020. COVID-19 has caused the global consumer behavior changes in 2020, which affects P2P sharing development. While the world is implanting vaccination for COVID-19, we believe P2P sharing activities will resume during the second half of 2021.
 
Listing Status
 
On November 26, 2018, we received a staff determination notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that as a result of its failure to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(c) (the “Rule”), the staff determined to deny the Company’s request for continued listing based on a plan of compliance submitted on October 26, 2018. Our common stock was delisted from Nasdaq at the open of trading on December 5, 2018. Our common stock is currently trading on the OTC Markets under the symbol “SEII.”

Our Sharing Economy Business
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018, we established new business divisions to focus on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses. We believe a true peer-to-peer sharing economy based on rentals will take significant market share in both the business and consumer markets over the next few years. 
 
Sharing economy business models are hosted through digital platforms that enable more precise, real-time measurement of spare capacity and have the ability to dynamically connect that capacity with those who need it. These digital platforms handle transactions that offer access over ownership through renting, lending, subscribing, reselling, swapping or donating. Consumers who use sharing economy business models are often more comfortable with transactions that involve deeper social interactions than traditional methods of exchange.
 
We have been exploring possible merger and acquisition opportunities that can bring to market more user-friendly platforms and convenient channels that allow people to rent what they need and make their lives easier. We are currently emphasizing the following areas:
 
On Demand Services
 
The ways people work and how services are provided has been changing, and there is a growing need for short-term services and workforces in the market. In December 2017, we acquired a 51% interest in Inspirit Studio Limited, which is engaged in developing a mobile app platform which provides instant errand services in a peer to peer model. BuddiGo, is our new mobile sharing platform that allows users to outsource daily chores and mundane tasks to “Buddies” who can spare idle time to run errands. According to iimediaResearch, the number of users participating in the peer-to-peer delivery sharing market in China has grown from 124 million in 2014 to 231 million in 2016, and experts expect it to grow to 353 million by the end of 2018.
 
During the year, BuddiGo, continuously promoted its service to the local market in Hong Kong. BuddiGo offers a wide range of errand services. Currently, about 80 percent of the orders received are for on-demand urgent delivery of items such as documents, flowers and cakes. Food delivery services are also available. During 2018, over 1,200 individuals have officially registered as sell-side buddies, who completed over 500 delivery orders in 2018, majority orders were happened in the third quarter. In addition, BuddiGo has signed up with a number of local business partners to provide ongoing delivery services for these clients. BuddiGo’s goal is to connect with the community and deliver localized content featuring BuddiGo’s core features and advantages. BuddiGo is actively seeking strategic investors or collaborative parties who are enthusiastic about its business model and can help achieve its business targets and expand into different countries.

Coworking and Coliving Development
 
According to Small Business Labs, the number of coworking spaces globally will exceed 30,000 by 2022, with over 5.1 million people utilizing coworking spaces. We are entering this market through partnerships and affiliations with current coworking and coliving space operators, including our recent acquisition of Anyworkspace.com, an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces. In 2018, AnyWorkspace focused on enlarging its exposure to the general public. We are currently revamping AnyWorkspace’s corporate website, www.anyworkspace.com. AnyWorkspace will also focus on digital marketing activities for its market expansion plans when there is available cash flow or funds from investors.
 
Given the existing coworking spaces providers marketing their available spaces and managing individual online business platform themselves, we expect our current global online platform will take years to materialize its worldwide customer base. Therefore, the intangible asset amounted to $0.6 million (equivalent to HK$4.97 million) representing the online platform acquired has been fully impaired in the last quarter of 2018.
 
Technology Development
 
In January 2018, we acquired a 60% interest in 3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery’s space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong’s leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality (“VR”) industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world’s largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app, Autocap, which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.
 
3D Discovery successfully completed a number of projects during the year. First, its “3D Virtual Tours in Hong Kong” generated about 1,371,000 impressions in 2018. In addition, 3D Discovery partnered with Midland Realty, one of the largest real estate agencies in Hong Kong, to establish the “Creation 200 3D Virtual Tours.” This business unit generated $215,000 in revenue in 2018.
 
We have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. We are working with our partners to develop SEII’s “Sharing Blocks,” a blockchain-based platform which provides functions for secured user profile information and transaction records through a “Blockchain as a Service” (BaaS) model, allowing third-party sharing economy applications to utilize and build a global consolidated and trustworthy sharing economy ecosystem. Our development team has completed the core engine development of “Sharing Blocks” and now undergoing system tests to ensure system performance, data integrity and accuracy, and security are all performing as expected.
 
In August 2017, we signed an agreement with ECoin Global Limited (“ECoin”) for the future purchase of ECoin redemption codes with an aggregate value of $50 million for total consideration of $20 million. We plan to resell the redemption codes in the form of ECrent gift cards at global locales through reseller channels, such as convenience stores. We are working with InComm, a global pre-payment network and solution provider, to sell the redemption codes with face values of HK$100, HK$300 and HK$500 at major convenience store networks in Hong Kong and Macau with other international locations to follow. On December 20, 2018, the agreement was terminated without recourse to the company. No sales were made under the agreement.

Sharing Communities
 
Because the sharing economy is predicated on the trust of all participants, we believe the best way to establish sharing behaviors is within communities. We are currently working with ECrent Capital Holdings Limited (“ECrent”), a private company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands focused on developing and operating a global rental platform to promote sharing economy across 30 countries and regions.
Asia Region:
 
In 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a license agreement with ECRENT, regarding the grant of an exclusive and sub-licensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in Taiwan, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Korea. According to the latest amendment, ECRENT will guarantee that the operation of its related websites, mobile applications and business services will contribute revenue of US$13,000,000 (increased from US$10,000,000 according to the previously amended agreement) and gross profit of US$2,522,000 (up from US$1,940,000 as stated on the previously amended agreement) from the closing date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2019 (extended from June 30, 2019 per the previously amended agreement).
 
In August 2018, SEIL has entered into a License Agreement with PTI Corporation (“PTI”), that sublicenses SEIL’s exclusive license with ECRENT to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in South Korea. In return, PTI shall pay to SEIL $230,000 (“Consideration”). The License Agreement will be effective on September 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In addition, if the aggregate revenue during the period exceeds the Consideration, SEIL shall receive 30% of the difference between the aggregate revenue and the Consideration. During the third quarter of 2018, PTI commenced prelaunch activities to develop the platform.
 
On December 27, 2019, the Company acquired 100% equity interest of ECRENT, through Peak Equity International Limited in the consideration 7,200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, at the price of $0.25, equal to $1,800,000,000.
 
After acquisition, the Company anticipated the re-organization of resources and its expansion plan across the Asian region.
 
Europe Region:
 
In August 2018, our subsidiary SEIL entered into a License Agreement with ECRENT regarding the grant of an exclusive and sub-licensable license from ECRENT to SEII to utilize certain software and trademarks in order to develop, launch, operate, commercialize, and maintain an online website platform in United Kingdom, Germany, France, Poland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. In return, SEII shall issue to ECRENT 360,000 shares of restricted common stock. Closing of this transaction was conditioned on various conditions, including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. On October 9, 2018, the agreement was terminated by the parties, who have agreed to forego their respective rights under the agreement.

Marketing and Distribution
 
Our sharing economy businesses are still in a very early stage of development. We intend to market and sell our services for these businesses primarily through online media advertising. Online marketing consists of search engine marketing, display advertisements, referral programs and affiliate marketing. We have established a business unit, EC Advertising Limited, to support these endeavors. EC Advertising will provide resources to support the marketing needs of the sharing economy businesses via partnerships and acquisitions of advertising companies.
Growth Strategies
 
In 2017, we began studying and acquiring sharing economy platforms in different market disciplines. Following these efforts, we are now grouping our sharing economy markets in verticals such as coworking and co-living communities, on-demand peer-to-peer services, and other sharing communities.
 
We believe further mergers and acquisitions have the potential to grow the Company rapidly and aggressively in new market opportunities, technology, products and platforms. We will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.


Competition
 
The global sharing economy continues to evolve, and we face competition from technology companies, both large and small, throughout the world. The Company aims to become a pioneer in the development of sharing economy solutions. The group is developing different sharing economy applications with a common user and transaction processing engine, which will become a sharing economy ecosystem for the convenience of users as well as allowing the group to effectively share technologies and business data. Our different sharing economy solutions will have the ability to collaborate with each other, allowing us to provide one-stop combined solutions to the market. We believe the ability to leverage and collaborate between our different sharing businesses will increase our market competitiveness.
Source of Supply
 
In our sharing economy business, IT development resources are crucial for the near-term development of our sharing platforms. We are in the process of signing fixed man-day service contracts with our external development consultants to ensure the availability of IT development resources under a fixed pricing scheme for the near future. We will continue to expand our IT development support resources cross regionally to avoid the dependency on a single or small number of sources.

Research and Development
 
In our sharing economy business, we have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. Given the early stage of the sharing economy business, we did not incur any R&D expenses in 2020 and 2019. We expect this to increase in 2021 as we work on building this business and the associated IT and transaction platforms.
Government Regulations
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Environmental commitments from the global communities will continue to help the development of sharing economy businesses in the coming years.
 
Business Licenses
 
We believe our sharing economy businesses are properly licensed with the appropriate government entities. However, because BuddiGo’s business model provides inner-city peer-to-peer delivery services, we could be identified as a member of the logistics industry by the governments of some countries where we conduct business. This could trigger additional licensing requirements.


Intellectual Property Rights
 
We intend to apply for more patents to protect our core technologies. We also have confidentiality and non-competition policies in place as part of our company employment guideline which is given to each employee, and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.
Employees
 
Sharing Economy Business
 
As of July 14, 2020, we had ten employees and several consultants who are engaged with us either individually or as a business entity.
