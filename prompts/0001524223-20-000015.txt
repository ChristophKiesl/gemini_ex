Item 1. Business.
Overview
Manning & Napier, Inc. is an independent registered investment advisor that provides clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies, including wealth management services. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations. 
Our objective is to create and develop financial solutions to help our clients meet their needs. We believe our differentiation is based on delivering comprehensive solutions, high-touch service, and attractive investment strategies in a custom-tailored, highly integrated manner. 
We have built a diverse client base of high-net-worth individuals, small business owners, middle market institutions, larger institutions, defined contribution plans, and unions, as well as clients via investment consultants or other intermediaries. Although our client base is national, we are primarily focused in certain targeted geographic regions. Clients access our solutions and strategies via separately managed accounts, mutual funds, and collective investment trusts.
Our investment strategies are powered by multiple research engines, employing traditional and quantitative approaches, and are offered as both single- and multi-asset class portfolios. While the mechanics of these processes may differ depending on the strategy, all of our strategies work from the underlying belief that active management is the best investment approach for meeting long-term client objectives. All of our strategies fully incorporate active asset allocation processes, and most strategies deliver active security selection as well.
We believe personalized financial advice is necessary to retain existing relationships and attract new clients. Our service teams include internal subject matter experts specific to areas beyond investments, including financial planning, endowment and foundation consulting, qualified plan and pension plan services, and custody and trust advice and administration. We believe these consultative services, combined with competitive long-term investment performance, have allowed us to achieve a high average annual separate account retention rate.
Over the course of our 50-year history, we view our team-based, client-centric approach as imperative to success and distinct within the industry. As of December 31, 2019, we have 32 publicly-available mutual fund share classes rated with four or five stars by Morningstar, and a number of our investment strategies have built value-added track records over multiple decades. 
Performance challenges from 2014-2016, along with the trend toward passive investing, especially among institutional investors, have resulted in declines in assets under management ("AUM") in recent years. Our active approach can cause us to be out of favor relative to benchmarks and/or peers over shorter time periods, and these short-term deviations can lead to changes in AUM trends over time. The following chart reflects our AUM as of December 31 for each of the last 10 years:

1

As of December 31, 2019, our investment management offerings include 47 distinct separate account composites and 44 mutual funds and collective investment trusts. We believe we have cultivated a robust menu of actively managed strategies that allow us to address client needs.
Our AUM as of December 31, 2019 by investment vehicle and portfolio were as follows:

The following table summarizes the annualized returns for several of our key investment strategies and relevant benchmarks. Since inception and over long-term periods, we believe our strategies have generated attractive returns on both an absolute and relative basis. We recognize, however, that some key strategies have mixed track records over the past decade. These key strategies are used across separate account, mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles, and represent approximately 74% of our AUM as of December 31, 2019. This table is provided for illustrative purposes only. The performance reflected in the table below is not necessarily indicative of the future results of our investment strategies.

Our Strategy
Our mission is to provide financial solutions that enable clients to achieve their long-term goals and objectives. Our success will be measured by the success of our clients. We must effectively execute in delivering investment results, financial advice, and a superior client experience in order to retain business and attract new business. 
Our strategy is focused on continuous refinement and improvement in two key areas: investment excellence and a superior client experience. This includes the performance of our investment strategies, the comprehensiveness of our financial advice, and the quality of our client service. These key areas form the foundation of our business and require constant evolution. 
 In early 2019 upon the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer, Marc Mayer, we commenced a comprehensive strategic review of our business, which focused on the evolution of our distribution strategy, our suite of investment offerings, and our technology initiatives. During the year we made important changes to our leadership team, implemented key governance and operating committees, revamped our distribution strategies, put in place definitive plans to overhaul and modernize our information technology systems and associated business processes, consolidated numerous offerings and solutions, eliminated sub-scale offerings, and reduced ongoing costs. Also see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis" in this Form 10-K for discussion on our strategic review.
Investments 
We believe that active management, in all of its many forms, is the most appropriate and relevant investment approach to achieving client goals across changing market environments. Whether investing in a country, industry, or individual company, we hold a strong belief that price matters across all of our strategies. We are focused on helping our clients avoid permanent loss of capital over long time horizons, which is different than managing day-to-day volatility.
All of our research engines deploy investment processes that are team-based in nature. By focusing on research teams instead of individuals, we are better able to emphasize repeatable processes instead of star personalities, while helping protect clients from staff turnover. Additionally, our investment processes are designed to allow teams to collaborate and combine top-down, bottom-up, and quantitative research. 
We believe our research department of over 50 primarily home-grown investment professionals enhance the consistency of our investment processes. As warranted, we may add to or supplement our research teams with additional investment professionals through corporate development activities. The most recent example of this is the Rainier International Small Cap Team that was added as part of our acquisition of Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier") in 2016. 
Dynamic financial markets and an onerous regulatory environment results in a fast changing industry. We recognize the need for our investment strategies to continuously evolve. We regularly review seeded portfolios to ensure that we are supporting competitive strategies that resonate with clients, while simultaneously closing portfolios that are no longer viable. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $9.4 million invested in seed capital with our research teams in new strategy concepts and expect to continue to deploy capital to support innovation in the future.
Client Experience
Our business is based on confidence and trust. We believe we must deliver a client experience that communicates clearly, is collaborative, and is accountable to clients. We view our clients as our partners, and we recognize that successful client-partners lead to a natural expansion of our business.
As of December 31, 2019, we have over 30 client-facing professionals, who are responsible for maintaining existing relationships and cultivating new business. Referrals are also an important source of new business, further highlighting the importance of our comprehensive client service and solutions.
Our client-facing professionals have a deep multi-channel structure, enabling greater focus and expertise on certain types of client relationships. Our Wealth Management group specializes in individuals and middle market relationships using a team-approach organized by region. Our Intermediary and Institutional team covers wider territories and concentrates on distribution to larger institutions and Taft-Hartley relationships, as well as through third party intermediaries. Our Portfolio Strategies Group specializes in consultant relations, as well as providing support for all of our client-facing professionals.
Alongside these professionals, we incorporate consultative services from internal subject-matter experts designed to create holistic solutions specific to individual client needs. Our experts have capabilities ranging from estate, tax and trust review for families, asset/liability modeling for defined benefit pension plans, retirement and health plan design analysis for employers, and donor relations and planned giving services for endowments and foundations. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on finding new ways to connect and engage with clients and prospects via targeted content on products, services, and topics that are most relevant to our various audiences. We have dedicated resources creating engaging and relevant content that positions Manning & Napier as a thought leader and a trusted resource. This content strategy focuses on educating investors, and it mirrors the consultative nature of our firm. We disseminate content in various ways, including through print publications, email, webinars, live events, our website, and social media.

In order for our investment teams and client-centric personnel to be most effective, we must also have excellence in middle- and back-office functions. These include our technology, operations, facilities, human resources, and compliance functions, each of which play a critical role in forming the foundation of business success.
In particular, our technological strategy is focused on using "software as a service" solutions while retaining in-house capabilities as needed. We believe that by leveraging the robust expertise of external providers, we can improve the nimbleness and efficiency of our organization. This approach provides the most update-to-date technology enabling a superior client experience, improving the employee experience, and streamlining operational processes.
Competition
Historically, we have competed to attract business on the basis of:

• | the breadth of financial solutions we offer clients in an integrated manner;


• | the investment excellence and long-term track records of our strategies;


• | the consultative advice we provide addressing clients’ unique challenges and needs;


• | the quality of the client experience and the duration of our relationships with them; and


• | the pricing of our solutions compared to competitors.

Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to retain our current investment and client-facing professionals and employees, as well as to attract highly qualified new professionals and employees. We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Structure
 The Company was incorporated in 2011 as a Delaware corporation, and is the sole managing member of Manning & Napier Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Manning & Napier Group”), a holding company for the investment management businesses conducted by its operating subsidiaries. The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2019. 
______________________

(1) | The consolidated operating subsidiaries of Manning & Napier Group include Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC ("MNA"), Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc., Exeter Trust Company and Rainier

As of December 31, 2019, we had 307 employees, most of whom are based in Fairport, New York. Collectively, William Manning, our co-founder and Chairman of the Board, current employee-owners and former employee owners own approximately 80.8% of Manning & Napier Group and our operating subsidiaries. We believe that our culture of employee ownership aligns our interests with those of our clients and stockholders by delivering strong long-term investment performance and solutions.

Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level and by self-regulatory organizations. We are also subject to regulations outside of the United States. Under certain of these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines.
SEC Regulation
MNA and Rainier are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (the "SEC"), as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, (the "Advisers Act"). Additionally, the Manning & Napier Fund, Inc., (the "Fund"), which is managed by MNA except for the Rainier International Discovery Series, for which Rainier serves as the sub-advisor, is registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, (the "1940 Act"). The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and mutual funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration.
As an investment adviser, we have fiduciary duties to our clients that are broad and apply to our entire relationship with our clients. These duties require us to serve the best interest of our clients and not subordinate the client's interest to our own. The SEC has interpreted these duties to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things:

• | trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts;


• | allocations of investment opportunities among clients;


• | use of soft dollars;


• | execution of transactions; and


• | recommendations to clients.

We manage accounts for a majority of our clients on a discretionary basis, which typically affords us the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with designated trade executions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers, which effectively reduces certain of our expenses. We believe all of our soft dollar arrangements comply with the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Constraints on our ability to use soft dollars as a result of statutory amendments or new regulations would increase our operating expenses and potentially hamper our investment process by limiting or eliminating access to vital research.
As a registered adviser, we are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things:

• | disclosure of information about our business to clients;


• | maintenance of formal policies and procedures;


• | maintenance of extensive books and records;


• | restrictions on the types of fees we may charge;


• | custody of client assets;


• | client privacy;


• | advertising; and


• | solicitation of clients.

The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate policies, procedures and systems to ensure compliance.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, 20% of our revenues were derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, including 18% derived from our advisory services to the Fund. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs and investment 
6

portfolios of the Fund and the investment portfolios of the funds we sub-advise, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors must not be “interested persons” with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement). The responsibilities of the board include, among other things, approving our investment management agreement with the Fund; approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. Our investment management agreements with the Fund may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days’ notice, and are subject to annual renewal by the Fund board after their initial term.
The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser’s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC through administrative action or litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action.
Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment management agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. 
Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc. ("MNBD"), our SEC-registered broker-dealer subsidiary is the distributor for the Fund and is subject to SEC rules and regulations, including the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires MNBD to maintain a certain level of liquid assets. MNBD complied with its net capital requirements during the year ended December 31, 2019. MNBD will be subject to the full scope of Regulation Best Interest, which will require its associated persons to adhere to a higher standard of care and ensure that security, strategy or account type recommendations are in the customer's best interest at the time of the recommendation.
FINRA Regulation
MNBD is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and as such is subject to the various industry and professional regulations, standards, and reporting requirements established by FINRA.
ERISA-Related Regulation
We are a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions.
The fiduciary duties under ERISA may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor by administrative action or litigation and by our benefit plan clients pursuant to a private right of action. The IRS may also assess excise taxes against us if we engage in prohibited transactions on behalf of or with our benefit plan clients.
New Hampshire Banking Regulation
Exeter Trust Company is a state-chartered non-depository trust company subject to the laws of the State of New Hampshire and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the New Hampshire Bank Commissioner.
Non-U.S. Regulation
Our sales and trading practices also subject us to certain foreign regulations. We have claimed an exemption from registration in Canada but are subject to those provincial regulations that apply to our limited operations in select Canadian provinces. Additionally, we invest globally and must adhere to country specific equity ownership reporting requirements in those foreign jurisdictions in which we invest. Our relationship with foreign domiciled clients or our sales and marketing efforts also could subject us to certain foreign regulations. We expect this trend to persist as such regulations increasingly have transnational application.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 307 employees, 297 of which are full-time, and most of whom are based in Fairport, New York.
