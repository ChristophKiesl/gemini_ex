 Overview
 Digimarc Corporation, an Oregon corporation founded in 2008, enables governments and enterprises around the world to give digital identities to media and objects that computers can sense and recognize, and to which they can react. We have developed the Digimarc Discover®, Digimarc Barcode and Intuitive Computing Platform that are designed to optimize the identification of all consumer brand impressions, wherever and whenever they may appear, facilitating modern mobile-centric shopping. The platform includes means to embed “Digimarc Barcodes,” invisible and inaudible barcode-like information that is recognizable by smartphones, tablets, industrial scanners, and other computer interfaces into virtually all forms of media content, including consumer product packaging. Digimarc Barcodes have many applications, including facilitating remarkably faster scanning of products at retail checkout as well as improved engagement with smartphone-equipped consumers. The Digimarc Barcode is robust yet imperceptible by people in ordinary use, allowing for reliable, efficient, economical, globally scalable, automatic identification of media without visible computer codes like traditional barcodes.
 Our media identification and discovery innovations enable our business partners to create numerous applications across a wide range of media content, including solutions that:
  
• | Improve the speed of retail checkout;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Provide simple and intuitive mobile customer engagement experiences in stores;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quickly and reliably identify and effectively manage music, movies, television programming, digital images, e-publications, documents and other printed materials, especially in light of non-linear distribution over the Internet;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deter counterfeiting of money, media and goods, and piracy of e-publications, movies and music;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support new digital media distribution models and methods to monetize media content;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the power of ubiquitous computing to instantly link consumers to a wealth of information and/or interactive experiences related to the media and objects they encounter each day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide consumers with more choice and access to media content when, where and how they want it;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Better secure identity documents to enhance national security and combat identity theft and fraud.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Intuitive Computing Platform has a proprietary foundation in signal processing innovation known as “digital watermarking,” which allows imperceptible digital information to be embedded in all forms of digitally designed, produced or distributed media content and many physical objects, including photographs, movies, music, television, personal identification documents, financial instruments, industrial parts and product packages. We refer to the embedded information as the Digimarc Barcode. This digital information can be detected and read by a wide range of computers, smartphones, tablets and other digital devices.
 Our inventions allow our business partners and customers to provide persistent digital identities for virtually any media content that is digitally processed at some point during its lifecycle. Our technology can be applied to printed materials, video, audio, and images to supply a wide range of consumer engagement, media management and security solutions across multiple consumer and government industry sectors. Over the years our enabling software and business processes, and associated intellectual property portfolio have grown to encompass many related technologies.
 We provide our solutions directly and through our business partners. Our inventions provide a powerful element of document security, giving rise to a long-term relationship with a consortium of central banks (the “Central Banks”), and many leading companies in the information technology industry. We and our business partners have successfully propagated the use of our technology in music, movies, television broadcasts, digital images, e-publications and printed materials. Digimarc Barcodes have been used in these applications to improve media rights and asset management, reduce piracy and counterfeiting losses, improve marketing programs, permit more efficient and effective distribution of valuable media content and enhance consumer entertainment and commercial experiences.
 Digimarc Barcodes can be used to enhance all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses, but quickly detected by computers, networks or other digital devices like smartphones and tablets. Unlike traditional barcodes and tags, our solution does not require publishers to give up valuable visual space in magazines and newspapers; nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the publication for readers. Digimarc Barcodes are imperceptible in normal use and do all that visible barcodes do, but perform better. Our Digimarc Discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to its readers on their smartphones or tablets across multiple media formats, including print, audio, video and packaging. Unique to the Digimarc Discover platform is its seamless multi-modal use of various content identification technologies as needed, including Digimarc Barcode when present.
 Banknote counterfeit deterrence was the first commercially successful large scale use of our technologies. Innovations based on our existing digital watermarking technology and experience have been leveraged to create new products to deter counterfeiting and tampering of driver licenses and other government-issued secure credentials. In parallel, our business partners, under patent or technology licenses from us, are delivering digital watermarking solutions to track and monitor the distribution of music, images, television and movies to consumers. 
 In November of 2007, we announced a relationship with The Nielsen Company (US) LLC (“Nielsen”) to license our patents in support of Nielsen’s industry leading television audience measurement solutions. 
 In October 2010, we entered into a patent licensing arrangement with IV Digital Multimedia Inventions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company affiliated with Intellectual Ventures (“IV”), pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to sublicense, subject to pre-existing encumbrances and a grant-back license, an aggregate of approximately 900 of the 1,200 patents and applications held by us at the time the agreement was entered into, as noted below in the section titled “Technology and Intellectual Property.” The number of patents licensed to IV is now approximately 550. Through ongoing development, our portfolio not licensed to IV has grown to over 550 patents and applications.
 In December 2012, we entered into a renewal and extension through 2024 of the Counterfeit Deterrence System Development and License Agreement with the Central Banks, with a 5-year extension option.

In January 2014, we introduced Digimarc Barcodes for use in consumer product packaging. These Digimarc Barcodes can contain the same information found in traditional universal product codes (“UPC”). The UPC information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface. We partnered with Datalogic, a global leader in automatic data capture and industrial automation markets and producer of barcode readers, in introducing the Digimarc Barcode to the consumer product packaging market. The first retail scanner enabled was Datalogic’s MagellanTM 9800i multi-plane imaging scanner. Since then, additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the Digimarc Barcode platform. Digimarc Barcodes can also connect mobile-enabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information, special offers, recommendations, reviews, social networks and more.
 Financial Information About Geographic Areas

 Customers and Business Partners
 Our revenue is generated through commercial and government applications of our technology. We derive our revenue primarily from development services, subscriptions for products and services, and licensing of our technology and patents. During 2016, we generated the majority of our revenue from development services under a long-term contract with the Central Banks, subscriptions to our anti-piracy and copyright protection services, and royalties from licensees.
 In 2016, revenue from government contracts accounted for 63% of our total revenue. Central Banks accounted for substantially all revenue generated under our government contracts. Our government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option periods. Government customers generally have the right to not exercise option periods. As part of our work with government customers, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business.
 Information about customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenue in the last three years is included in Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Products and Services
 We provide media identification and management solutions to commercial entities and government customers and license our technology and patented inventions to other solution providers. Our largest government customer is the Central Banks, with whom we have been developing, deploying, supporting and enhancing a system to deter digital counterfeiting of currency using personal computers and digital reprographics for the last 18 years. We license primarily to commercial entities who use our technology and patented inventions in the media and entertainment industry. Commercial customers use a range of solutions from our business partners and us to identify, track, manage and protect content as it is distributed and consumed—either digitally or physically—and to enable new consumer applications to access networks and information from personal computers and mobile devices. Many movie studios, record labels, broadcasters, creative professionals and other customers rely on our technology as a cost-effective means to:

• | deter piracy and illegal use of movies, music, e-publications and images;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protect entertainment content from copyright infringement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | track and monitor entertainment content for rights usage and licensing compliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digimarc Barcodes are easily embedded into all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses, but quickly detected by computers, networks or other digital devices like smartphones. Unlike traditional barcodes and tags, our solution does not require content owners to give up valuable space on their media content; nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of their media content. Our Digimarc Discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to smartphones across multiple media including print, audio, video and packaging. Unique to the Digimarc Discover platform is its ability to use various content identification technologies as needed, including our patented technology.
 Digimarc Barcodes contain the same information found in traditional UPC codes used on consumer goods packing. The UPC information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface. We partnered with Datalogic, a global leader in automatic data capture and industrial automation markets and producer of barcode readers, in bringing the Digimarc Barcode to the market. The first retail scanner enabled was Datalogic’s MagellanTM 9800i multi-plane imaging scanner. Since then additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the Digimarc Barcode platform. Digimarc Barcodes can also connect mobile-enabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information, special offers, recommendations, reviews, social networks and more.

 Technology and Intellectual Property
 We seek patent protection for our inventions to differentiate our products and technologies, mitigate infringement risks, and develop opportunities for licensing. Our broad patent portfolio covers a wide range of methods, applications, system architectures and processes.
 Many of our patents relate to various methods for embedding and decoding digital information in video, audio and images, whether the content is rendered in analog or digital formats. The digital information is generally embedded by making subtle modifications to the fundamental elements of the content itself, generally at a signal processing level. The changes necessary to embed this information are so subtle that they are generally not noticeable by people during normal use. Because the message is carried by the content itself, it is file-format independent. The embedded digital information generally survives most normal content transformations, including compression, edits, rotation, scaling, re-sampling, file-format transformations, copying, scanning and printing.
 Our intellectual property contains many innovations in digital watermarking, content recognition (sometimes referred to as “fingerprinting”), digital rights management and related fields. To protect our inventions, we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and nondisclosure agreements and other contracts. As a result, we believe we have one of the world’s most extensive patent portfolios in digital watermarking and related fields, with approximately 1,100 U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications as of December 31, 2016. We continue to develop and broaden our portfolio in the fields of media identification and management technology and related applications and systems. We devote significant resources to developing and protecting our inventions and continuously seek to 
 4


identify and evaluate potential licensees for our patents. The patents in our portfolio have a life of approximately 20 years from the effective filing date, and up to 17 years after the patent has been granted.
 For a discussion of activities and costs related to our research and development in the last three years, please read “Research, development and engineering” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Markets
 Our patented inventions are used in various media identification and management products and solutions supporting a variety of media objects, from movies and music to banknotes, secure credentials and consumer packaged goods. Each media object enabled by our inventions creates the potential for several applications, such as:

• | counterfeiting and piracy deterrence;
--+--------------------------------------


• | online e-publication piracy protection;
--+----------------------------------------


• | content identification and media management;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | authentication and monitoring;
--+-------------------------------


• | retail point of sale transaction processing;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | linking to networks and providing access to information; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced services in support of mobile commerce.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 We believe the market for most of these applications is in the early stages of development and that existing solutions represent only a small portion of the potential market for our products, services and technology.
 Competition
 No single competitor or small number of competitors dominate our market. Our competitors vary depending on the application of our products and services. We generally compete with non-digital watermarking technologies for the security or marketing budgets of the producers and distributors of media objects, documents, products and advertising. These alternatives include, among other things, encryption-based security systems and technologies and solutions based on fingerprinting, pattern recognition, and traditional barcodes. Our competitive position in digital watermarking applications is strong because of our large, high-quality, sophisticated patent portfolio and our substantial and growing amount of intellectual property in related media security and management innovations that span basic technologies, applications, system designs and business processes. Our intellectual property portfolio allows us to use proprietary technologies that are well-regarded by our customers and partners, and not available to our competitors without a license. We compete based on the variety of features we offer and a traditional cost/benefit analysis against alternative technologies and solutions. We anticipate that our competitive position within some markets may be affected by factors such as reluctance to adopt new technologies and by changes in government regulations.
Backlog
 Based on projected commitments we have for the periods under contract with our respective customers, we anticipate our current contracts as of December 31, 2016 will generate a minimum of $31 million in revenue. We expect approximately $17 million of this amount to be recognized as revenue during 2017.
 Some factors that lead to increased backlog include:
  
• | contracts with new customers;
--+------------------------------


• | renewals with current customers;
--+---------------------------------


• | add-on orders with customers; and
--+----------------------------------


• | contracts with longer contractual periods replacing contracts with shorter contractual periods.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some factors that lead to decreased backlog include:
  
• | recognition of revenue associated with backlog currently in place;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | contracts with shorter contractual periods replacing contracts with longer contractual periods;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | modifications to existing contracts;
--+-------------------------------------


• | contract minimum payments ending; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | expiration of contracts with existing customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 The mix of these factors, among others, dictates whether our backlog increases or decreases for any given period. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, because the orders, awards and contracts included in our backlog may be subject to modification, cancellation or suspension. We may not realize revenue on certain contracts, orders or awards included in our backlog or the timing of any realization may change.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2016, we had 180 full-time employees, including 58 in sales, marketing, technical support and customer support; 88 in research, development and engineering, including intellectual property; and 34 in finance, administration, information technology and legal.
 Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
