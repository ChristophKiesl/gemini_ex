Item 1. Business
 
This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
 
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
 
Our financial statements are stated in United States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
 
In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
 
As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean The Healing Company Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada.
 
Historical Overview
 
Lake Forest Minerals was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008.
 
We are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history.
 
Effective January 31, 2021, Astutia Venture Capital AG acquired 8,000,000 of the issued and outstanding common shares of Lake Forest Minerals Inc. (“we’, “us”, “our”, the “Company”).  As a result of the transaction, Astutia Venture Capital AG holds 72.7% of our outstanding voting securities.  The shares were acquired in a private transaction from Mr. Jeffrey Taylor using the purchaser’s funds.  Mr. Taylor no longer holds any equity interest in our Company.
 
Our board of directors and major shareholder approved a name change of our company from Lake Forest Minerals Inc. to The Healing Company Inc. Also, our company’s board of directors approved a resolution to effect a forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a four (4) new shares for one (1) share held. Upon effectiveness of the forward split, our authorized capital was 300,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 11,000,000 to 44,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001. Certificate of Amendment to effect the forward split and the change of name was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 29, 2021. The name change and forward stock split were subsequently reviewed and approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) with an effective date of June 2, 2021.
 
Our Current Business
 
Our plan is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction (i.e., a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other operating business entity (a “Merger Target”) desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation. We have no operating business, and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements.
 
Our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources. We are currently considered a “shell” company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet--to--be identified operating company or business. We have no employees and no material assets.

We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities.
 
We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to affect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.
 
A common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.
 
The prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we will consider several factors, including the following: - experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business; - costs associated with effecting the business combination; - equity interest retained by our stockholders in the merged entity; - growth potential of the target business; capital requirements of the target business; - capital available to the target business; - stage of development of the target business; - proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business; - the financial statements of the target business; and - the regulatory environment in which the target business operates.
 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as well as other considerations we deem relevant.
 
In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial, legal and other information. The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time.
 
Our president intends to devote only a very small portion of his time to our affairs, and, accordingly, the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However, he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination.
 
We anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources, including securities broker -dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, including, possibly, the executive officers and our affiliates. Various impediments to a business combination may arise, such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.
 
In cooperation with our major shareholder, the company will seek to redefine and more narrowly tailor its corporate objectives to establish a platform of companies that source, harvest and utilize the most natural compounds for holistic nutrition from around the world. In doing so, the Company intends to offer the best natural remedies to connect humans with nature, and prevent and heal lifestyle diseases on a broad scale.
 
Other than as set out in this annual report, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.
