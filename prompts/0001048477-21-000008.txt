Recent Developments
Regulatory Review of Vosoritide for the Treatment of Achondroplasia
On February 25, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted priority review designation for our New Drug Application (NDA) for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. On November 2, 2020, we announced that the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted our vosoritide NDA and the FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is August 20, 2021. See “Major Product Candidates in Development — Vosoritide” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding vosoritide.
Product Candidate BMN 307 for the Treatment of PKU
On February 25, 2021, we announced that we plan to dose escalate in the PHEarless Phase 1/2 study of BMN 307, a gene therapy for the treatment of PKU, based on encouraging Phe lowering and safety signals observed in study participants who were treated with the lowest dose. 
Product Candidate BMN 255 for the Treatment of a Subset of Chronic Renal Disease 
On January 11, 2021, we announced that we filed an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for BMN 255, a small molecule for the treatment of a subset of chronic renal disease. 
Updated Phase 3 Data for Product Candidate Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec for the Treatment of Severe Hemophilia A 
On January 10, 2021, we announced topline results from our ongoing global Phase 3 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. All 134 study participants received a single dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and completed a year or more of follow-up. Data from the study in the pre-specified primary analysis for Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) showed that a single dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec significantly reduced ABR by 84% compared with prior treatment with prophylactic Factor VIII infusions from 4.8 (median 2.8) bleeding episodes per year at baseline to 0.8 (median 0.0). These results were from a pre-specified group of 112 participants in a non-interventional prospective baseline observational study with a median follow-up of 60.1 weeks after dosing with valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Of the 112 rollover study participants, 80% were bleed-free starting at week five after treatment. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec also significantly reduced the mean annualized Factor VIII usage in the rollover population by 99%, from 135.9 (median 128.6) to 2.0 (median 0.0) infusions per year. At the end of the first year post-infusion with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, 132 participants in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population had a mean endogenous Factor VIII expression level of 42.9 (SD 45.5, median 23.9) IU/dL, as measured by the chromogenic substrate assay, supporting the clinical benefits observed with significant reduction of bleeding episodes and Factor VIII infusion rate. Factor VIII expression declined at a slower rate compared to the Phase 1/2 study, and remained in a range to provide hemostatic efficacy. In the 17 participants who comprise a subset of the mITT population and had been dosed at least two years prior to the data cut date, Factor VIII expression declined from a mean of 42.2 (SD 50.9, median 23.9) IU/dL at the end of year one to a mean of 24.4 (SD 29.2, median 14.7) IU/dL at the end of year two with continued hemostatic efficacy demonstrated by a mean ABR of 0.9 (median 0.0) bleeding episodes per year. See “Major Product Candidates in Development — Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding valoctocogene roxaparvovec.
Two-Year Phase 3 Data for Product Candidate Vosoritide for the Treatment of Achondroplasia 
On December 21, 2020, we announced results from our pivotal global Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 121 children with achondroplasia ages 5-14 for two years. The data demonstrated that children in the open-label long-term extension of the Phase 3 study maintained an increase in Annual Growth Velocity (AGV) through the second year of continuous treatment. An analysis comparing 52 children who were randomized and treated with vosoritide for two years to 38 children from the run-in study who were randomized to receive placebo with an untreated observation period of two years showed improvement in one-year height change in the treated group relative to the untreated group. The one-year height change improvement in the second year of treatment, 1.79 cm, was similar to the one-year height change improvement in the first year of treatment, 1.73 cm. The cumulative height gain over the two-year period for treated children was 3.52 cm more than untreated children. See “Major Product Candidates in Development — Vosoritide” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding vosoritide.

Vimizim
Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IVA, a lysosomal storage disorder. MPS IVA is a disease characterized by deficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected. We have identified over 2,000 patients worldwide suffering from MPS IVA and estimate that the total number of patients suffering from MPS IV A worldwide could be as many as 3,000.
Vimizim is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets.
Kuvan
Kuvan is a proprietary synthetic oral form of 6R-BH4, a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), indicated for patients with PKU. Kuvan is the first drug for the treatment of PKU, which is an inherited metabolic disease that affects at least 50,000 diagnosed patients under the age of 40 in the developed world. We believe that approximately 30% to 50% of those with PKU could benefit from treatment with Kuvan. PKU is caused by a deficiency of activity of an enzyme, PAH, which is required for the metabolism of Phe. Phe is an essential amino acid found in all protein-containing foods. Without sufficient quantity or activity of PAH, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood, resulting in a variety of serious neurological complications, including severe mental retardation and brain damage, mental illness, seizures and other cognitive problems. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all PKU patients under the age of 40 in developed countries have been diagnosed at birth. Currently, PKU can be managed by a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by nutritional replacement products, like formulas and specially manufactured foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels.
Kuvan tablets were granted marketing approval for the treatment of PKU in the U.S. in December 2007 and in the EU in December 2008. In December 2013, the FDA approved the use of Kuvan powder for oral solution that is provided in a dose sachet packet allowing faster dissolution of powder in solution compared to the current tablet form. We commenced the commercial launch of this new form of Kuvan in February 2014. We market Kuvan in the U.S., the EU and other international markets (excluding Japan). In certain international markets, Kuvan is also approved for, or is only approved for, the treatment of primary BH4 deficiency, a different disorder than PKU.
Two companies previously filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder and we subsequently entered into settlement agreements regarding Kuvan with both companies. Generic versions of Kuvan first became available in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2020. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the settlement agreements and for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of Kuvan. Please see “Government Regulation – The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding ANDAs.
Naglazyme
Naglazyme is a recombinant form of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) indicated for patients with MPS VI. MPS VI is a debilitating life-threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Patients with MPS VI typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, spinal cord compression, enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, skeletal deformities, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
Naglazyme is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets.
Palynziq
Palynziq is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, which is delivered through subcutaneous injection to reduce blood Phe concentrations. On May 24, 2018, the FDA approved the use of Palynziq in adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L (10mg/dL) on existing management. In October 2020, we announced that the FDA approved our supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) to increase the maximum allowable dose of Palynziq Injection for treatment of adults with PKU to 60 mg daily. Previously, the maximum dose was 40 mg daily. Palynziq is our second approved treatment for PKU. Palynziq is only available in the U.S. through the Palynziq Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the product. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:
•prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;
•prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with Palynziq;
•pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense Palynziq only to patients who are authorized to receive it;
•patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks and benefits of treatment with Palynziq; and
•patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking Palynziq.
Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by the REMS program.
On May 6, 2019, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Palynziq in the EU, at doses of up to 60 mg once daily, to reduce Phe concentrations in patients with PKU aged 16 and older who have inadequate blood Phe control (blood Phe levels greater than 600 micromol/L) despite prior management with available treatment options.
Aldurazyme
Aldurazyme is a highly purified protein that is designed to be identical to a naturally occurring form of the human enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Aldurazyme is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets for patients with MPS I. MPS I is a progressive and debilitating life-threatening genetic disease, for which no other drug treatment currently exists, that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Patients with MPS I typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in all tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, delayed and regressed mental development (in the severe form of the disease), enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
We developed Aldurazyme through collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme (Genzyme), now a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Under our collaboration agreement with Genzyme, we are responsible for manufacturing Aldurazyme and supplying it to Genzyme. We receive payments ranging from 39.5% to 50% on worldwide net Aldurazyme sales by Genzyme depending on sales volume. Genzyme and we are members of BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, a 50/50 limited liability company (the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC) that: (1) holds the intellectual property relating to Aldurazyme and other collaboration products and licenses all such intellectual property on a royalty-free basis to us and Genzyme to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the agreements related to the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and (2) engages in research and development activities that are mutually selected and funded by Genzyme and us.
Brineura
Brineura is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) and is approved for the treatment of patients with CLN2, a form of Batten disease, in the U.S., the EU and other international markets. CLN2 is an incurable, rapidly progressive disease that typically ends in patient death by 10-12 years of age. Patients are initially healthy but begin to decline at approximately the age of three. We estimate that up to 1,200 to 1,600 cases exist worldwide. On April 27, 2017, Brineura was approved in the U.S. to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in symptomatic pediatric patients three years of age and older with CLN2. Brineura is the first treatment approved to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in children with CLN2 disease.
On June 1, 2017, we announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for Brineura in the EU to treat children with CLN2. Brineura is the first treatment approved in the EU for the treatment of CLN2. On April 21, 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion for our Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Brineura following an accelerated review procedure, reserved for medicinal products expected to be a major public health interest. Brineura was one of the first therapies to go through this process.
Brineura is administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and intended to be used in combination with a delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Please see “Government Regulation – Combination Products” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on combination products.
Major Product Candidates in Development
Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is an adeno associated virus (AAV5) vector drug development candidate designed to restore factor VIII plasma concentrations in patients with severe hemophilia A. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia rankings of severity of hemophilia A, the normal range of factor VIII activity levels is between 50% and 150%, expressed as a percentage of normal factor activity in blood, the mild hemophilia A range of factor VIII activity levels is between 5% and 40%, the moderate hemophilia A range of factor VIII activity levels is between 1% and 5%, and the severe hemophilia range of factor VIII activity levels is less than 1%. People living with hemophilia A are not able to form blood clots efficiently and are at risk for excessive bleeding from modest injuries, potentially endangering their lives. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints. 
On May 21, 2020, we announced an update to our previously reported results of an open-label Phase 1/2 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. The four-year update for the 6e13 vg/kg and three-year update for the 4e13 vg/kg cohorts demonstrated that all subjects in both cohorts had remained off prophylactic Factor VIII treatment since receiving their single dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. In addition, cumulative mean annualized bleed rates (ABR) remain less than one in both cohorts and below pre-treatment baseline levels.
On January 10, 2021, we announced topline results from our ongoing global Phase 3 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. All 134 study participants received a single dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and completed a year or more of follow-up. Data from the study in the pre-specified primary analysis for ABR showed that a single dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec significantly reduced ABR by 84% compared with prior treatment with prophylactic Factor VIII infusions from 4.8 (median 2.8) bleeding episodes per year at baseline to 0.8 (median 0.0). These results were from a pre-specified group of 112 participants in a non-interventional prospective baseline observational study with a median follow-up of 60.1 weeks after dosing with valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Of the 112 rollover study participants, 80% were bleed-free starting at week five after treatment. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec also significantly reduced the mean annualized Factor VIII usage in the rollover population by 99%, from 135.9 (median 128.6) to 2.0 (median 0.0) infusions per year. At the end of the first year post-infusion with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, 132 participants in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population had a mean endogenous Factor VIII expression level of 42.9 (SD 45.5, median 23.9) IU/dL, as measured by the chromogenic substrate assay, supporting the clinical benefits observed with significant reduction of bleeding episodes and Factor VIII infusion rate. Factor VIII expression declined at a slower rate compared to the Phase 1/2 study, and remained in a range to provide hemostatic efficacy. In the 17 participants who comprise a subset of the mITT population and had been dosed at least two years prior to the data cut date, Factor VIII expression declined from a mean of 42.2 (SD 50.9, median 23.9) IU/dL at the end of year one to a mean of 24.4 (SD 29.2, median 14.7) IU/dL at the end of year two with continued hemostatic efficacy demonstrated by a mean ABR of 0.9 (median 0.0) bleeding episodes per year. 
In addition to the ongoing Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies of valoctocogene roxaparvovec described above, we have multiple other clinical studies of valoctocogene roxaparvovec underway. We recently began enrolling participants in a Phase 3b, single arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec at a dose of 6e13 vg/kg with prophylactic corticosteroids in people with severe hemophilia A. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 study with the 6e13kg/vg dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in approximately 10 participants with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies, as well as another Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in people with severe hemophilia A with active or prior FVIII inhibitors.
Overall, valoctocogene roxaparvovec continues to have a favorable safety profile and has been generally well tolerated by participants across all doses in the Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies. None of the study participants developed inhibitors to Factor VIII or thromboembolic events. One participant in the Phase 3 study was lost to follow-up. The most common adverse events associated with valoctocogene roxaparvovec across studies occurred early and included transient infusion-associated reactions and transient, asymptomatic, and mild to moderate rises in the levels of certain proteins and enzymes measured in liver function tests. Common, steroid-related side effects can occur with temporary use of corticosteroid (or alternative immunosuppressants) to manage elevated levels of certain proteins and enzymes in the liver. These side effects have generally been mild to moderate, manageable and reversible.
On February 20, 2020, we announced that the FDA accepted for priority review our BLA for valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. On August 18, 2020, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to our BLA for valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. In the CRL, the FDA introduced a new request for two-year follow-up safety and efficacy data on all study participants from our ongoing Phase 3 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The Phase 3 study was fully enrolled in November 2019, and the last patient in the study will complete two years of follow-up in November 2021. We plan to meet with the FDA to review the two-year follow-up data request and share the one-year top-line Phase 3 data described above.
On December 23, 2019, we announced that the EMA validated our MAA for valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A, which had been in review under accelerated assessment since January 2020. The EMA recently requested the 52-week results from the full Phase 3 study cohort of 134 subjects to inform their benefit-risk assessment. To facilitate this submission within the EMA regulatory framework, we recently withdrew our MAA and we are targeting resubmission of the MAA with these data in the second quarter of 2021 pending confirmation in presubmission meetings. 
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec has also been accepted for Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme from the EMA. Additionally, the FDA has granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy designation.
Vosoritide
Vosoritide is an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. Vosoritide has been and is being tested only in children in the age range when their growth plates are still open, which is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. In June 2019, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from our Phase 2 open-label, dose-finding and extension study for vosoritide in children aged 5 to 14 years with achondroplasia receiving a continuous dose of 15 µg/kg/day. AGV increased from baseline in all cohorts during each 12-month interval by 1.10 to 2.34 cm/year through 42 months. In cohort 3, which received 15 μg/kg continuous dosing from baseline, the mean AGV derived between 30 and 42 months was 5.51 cm/year, representing a 1.46 cm/year change from baseline. On November 14, 2019, we announced that children in cohort 3 over 54 months achieved a statistically significant cumulative additional mean height gain of 9.0 cm compared to children, matched for age and gender, in a natural history achondroplasia dataset. In the global Phase 2 study of children with achondroplasia ages 0-5, enrollment of the first cohort (24-60 months) and the second cohort (6-24 months) is complete. Cohort 3 (0-6 months) is actively enrolling and close to completely enrolled. 
On December 21, 2020, we announced results from our pivotal global Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 121 children with achondroplasia ages 5-14 for two years. The data demonstrated that children in the open-label long-term extension of the Phase 3 study maintained an increase in AGV through the second year of continuous treatment. An analysis comparing 52 children who were randomized and treated with vosoritide for two years to 38 children from the run-in study who were randomized to receive placebo with an untreated observation period of two years showed improvement in one-year height change in the treated group relative to the untreated group. The one-year height change improvement in the second year of treatment, 1.79 cm, was similar to the one-year height change improvement in the first year of treatment, 1.73 cm. The cumulative height gain over the 2-year period for treated children was 3.52 cm more than untreated children.
On November 9, 2020, we announced an expansion of our clinical program for vosoritide with two new Phase 2 studies. The first study is sponsored by BioMarin to investigate the safety of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia at risk of life-threatening foramen magnum compression. The second study, an investigator-initiated study sponsored by Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., will investigate vosoritide in children with selected genetic forms of short stature. Together, these two studies represent addressable patient populations of approximately 275,000.
Overall, vosoritide continues to have a favorable safety profile and has been generally well tolerated by participants across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with no clinically significant blood pressure changes and a mild side effect profile.
On February 25, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted priority review designation for our NDA for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. On November 2, 2020, we announced that the FDA accepted our NDA for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia and the FDA PDUFA target action date is August 20, 2021. When the FDA accepted 
our NDA for vosoritide, the agency reiterated its position raised during the vosoritide Pediatric Advisory Committee and Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee held in May 2018, recommending two, two-year placebo-controlled trials in different age groups. Although our vosoritide clinical program does not meet every element of the FDA’s recommendation, we designed our studies of vosoritide in a manner that we believe can demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate for the target patient population. However, the FDA may ultimately disagree with our position that our vosoritide trials support regulatory approval.
On August 13, 2020, we announced that the EMA validated our MAA for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. We anticipate an opinion from the CHMP on our MAA for vosoritide in June 2021.
Vosoritide has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA.
BMN 307 
BMN 307 is an AAV5 mediated gene therapy that is designed to normalize blood Phe concentration levels in patients with PKU. We tested a broad range of vector constructs and combinations to optimize the vector and increase potency, resulting in a 10-fold increase in potency for the selected vector. Treatment of mice in a validated PKU mouse model with BMN 307 showed a lifetime normalization of Phe and normalized neurotransmitter levels. BMN 307 will be evaluated to determine safety and whether a single dose of treatment can restore natural Phe metabolism, normalize plasma Phe levels, and enable a normal diet in patients with PKU. On January 13, 2020, we announced that both the FDA and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom (U.K.) granted IND status and approved our Clinical Trial Application (CTA), respectively, for BMN 307 for the treatment of PKU. On September 24, 2020, we announced that we had dosed the first participant in the global PHEarless Phase 1/2 study of BMN 307. On February 25, 2021, we announced that we plan to dose escalate in the PHEarless Phase 1/2 study of BMN 307 based on encouraging Phe lowering and safety signals observed in study participants who were treated with the lowest dose.
BMN 307 has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA and Fast Track designation from the FDA.
Manufacturing
We manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, Palynziq, Vimizim and vosoritide in our production facilities located in Novato, California. We currently also manufacture the API for Brineura and Vimizim in our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland. These facilities have demonstrated compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EC and health agencies in other countries for the commercial production of Naglazyme, Palynziq, and Vimizim. We believe that with our Novato, California facility and our Shanbally facility, we have ample manufacturing capacity to support anticipated commercial demand for Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim for at least the next five years.
We contract with third parties to manufacture Kuvan API and drug substance. All our drug product manufacturing (which includes vials, syringes, tablets, and powder) and most packaging operations are performed by contract manufacturers. We expect to continue to contract with outside service providers for certain manufacturing services, including drug substance, drug product, and packaging operations for our products. All of our facilities and those of any third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic inspections confirming compliance with applicable law and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales. Third-party manufacturers’ facilities are subject to periodic inspections to confirm compliance with applicable law and must be cGMP certified. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers provide for ample operating capacity to support the anticipated clinical and commercial demand for these products. In certain instances, there is only one approved contract manufacturer for certain aspects of the manufacturing process. In such cases, we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, maintaining safety stock and other appropriate strategies.
In July 2017, we commissioned our commercial-scale gene therapy manufacturing facility, located in Novato, California, where we conduct cGMP production of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and BMN 307 to support clinical development activities and anticipated commercial demand. This facility has the potential to support the commercial production of multiple gene therapy products to meet global commercial demand, depending on dose and production mix. The facility’s production processes have been developed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use facilitating worldwide registration with health authorities.
Raw Materials
Raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are available in some instances from one supplier and in other instances from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We have adopted policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from our suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.
Sales and Marketing
We have established a commercial organization, including a sales force, to support our product lines directly in the U.S., Europe, South America and certain other significant markets. For other selected markets, we have signed agreements with other companies to act as distributors of Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim. Most of these agreements generally grant the distributor the right to market the product in the territory and the obligation to secure all necessary regulatory approvals for commercial or named patient sales. Additional markets are being assessed at this time and additional agreements may be signed in the future.
Genzyme has the exclusive right to distribute, market and sell Aldurazyme globally and is required to purchase its requirements exclusively from us.
In the U.S., our products (other than Aldurazyme) are marketed through our commercial teams, including sales representatives and supporting staff members, who promote our products, directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. Outside of the U.S., our sales representatives and supporting staff members market our products (other than Aldurazyme). We believe that with moderate changes in 2021, the size of our sales force will be appropriate to effectively reach our target customers in markets where our products are directly marketed. The launch of any future products, if approved, will likely require expansion of our commercial organization, including our sales force, in the U.S. and international markets.
We utilize third-party logistics companies to store and distribute our products. Moreover, we use third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. 
Customers
Our Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim customers include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and non-U.S. government agencies. We also sell Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, such as those in Latin America, governments place large periodic orders for Naglazyme and Vimizim. The timing of these orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenue. Palynziq is currently distributed in the U.S. pursuant to the REMS program through a limited number of certified specialty pharmacies. During 2020, 45% of our net product revenues, excluding Aldurazyme, was generated by three customers. Genzyme is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third parties.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Within the industry, there are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have or may soon initiate programs for the same indications that our products and product candidates are intended to treat. Furthermore, universities and non-profit research organizations may have research programs, both early-stage and clinical, in the same disease areas. Our competitors may have advantages over us due to greater financial or scientific resources, lower labor and other costs, or due to higher headcount and more robust organizational structures. Our competitors have considerable experience in drug manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research and development, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales, and distribution. They pursue broad patent portfolios and other intellectual property to protect the products they are developing. Their products may outcompete ours due to one or more factors, including faster progress through preclinical and clinical development, lower manufacturing costs, superior safety and efficacy, lower pricing, stronger patent protection, and better marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. In this event, our products and product candidates, if approved, could fail to gain significant market share, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Other than Kuvan (which faces generic competition, as described below), our products have no direct approved competition currently on the market in the U.S. or the EU; however, other companies are in the development phase with new and 
generic products. Our products and product candidates have potential competition from products under development either using similar technology to our programs or different treatment strategies. The following is a summary of some of the primary possible future competitors for our products and product candidates, but the information below may not include all potential competition. 
Commercial Products
Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, and Vimizim
In the mucopolysaccharidosis field, several companies are researching treatments using small molecules, gene therapy, and other novel technologies. Aldurazyme, for the treatment of MPS I, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from ArmaGen, Inc., JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Orchard Therapeutics Plc, RegenxBio Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including a product candidate from Immusoft Corporation. Naglazyme, for the treatment of MPS VI, has potential competition from a clinical stage product candidate from Inventiva S.A. and other potential candidates in earlier stages. Vimizim, for the treatment of MPS IVA, has potential competition from a preclinical product candidate from Esteve Pharmaceuticals, S.A. and other potential candidates in earlier stages.
Brineura
Brineura, for the treatment of CLN2, has potential competition from preclinical product candidates from RegenxBio Inc. and the Roche Group.
Kuvan and Palynziq
There are currently no other approved, non-generic drugs on the market in the U.S. or the EU for the treatment of PKU. However, two companies previously filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted ANDAs to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder. We entered into settlement agreements regarding Kuvan with both companies, which allowed these companies to market generic versions of sapropterin dihydrochloride. Generic versions of Kuvan first became available in the U.S. in October 2020. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the settlement agreements and for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of Kuvan in the U.S. and international markets. Please see “Government Regulation – The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding ANDAs. Kuvan and Palynziq also have potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Homology Medicines, Inc., Nestle Health Science, S.A., PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including product candidates from Generation Bio Co., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. and SOM Innovation Biotech, S.A. BMN 307 is our clinical gene therapy program for PKU, and other companies are also developing gene therapy product candidates for PKU, as described in “Competition—Product Candidates—BMN 307” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Major Product Candidates in Development
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, a gene therapy product candidate for severe hemophilia A, could have competition from marketed recombinant factor VIII replacement therapies, a novel bispecific antibody marketed by the Roche Group, and clinical stage programs, including gene therapy product candidates under development by Bayer AG, Pfizer, Inc., the Roche Group, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. and preclinical product candidates from other companies, including Freeline Therapeutics Ltd. and Uniqure N.V. In addition, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are developing novel non-factor replacement product candidates in the clinic for the treatment of hemophilia A.
Vosoritide
Vosoritide, for the treatment of achondroplasia, could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S and Pfizer, Inc., and preclinical product candidates from other companies, including QED Therapeutics, Inc.
BMN 307
BMN 307, a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of PKU, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Homology Medicines, Inc., Nestle Health Science, S.A., Synlogic, Inc. and earlier 
stage product candidates, including product candidates from Generation Bio Co., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. and SOM Innovation Biotech, S.A.
BMN 331
BMN 331, a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, has potential competition from marketed therapies by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CSL Limited and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., clinical stage product candidates from CSL Limited, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Kalvista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pharvaris GmbH and earlier stage product candidates from Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Regenxbio Inc. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and also erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. Furthermore we seek to protect our ownership of know-how, trade secrets and trademarks through an active program of legal mechanisms including registrations, assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations and licenses.
The table below lists our outstanding patents and patent applications of primary importance for our products other than Aldurazyme by territory, general subject matter (including composition, methods of treatment and approved use, methods of production and purification, pharmaceutical compositions and clinical formulations) and latest expiry date. With respect to Aldurazyme, the last of our patents expired in November 2020. One or more patents with the same or earlier expiry dates may fall under the same general subject matter and are not listed separately in the table below. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend patent exclusivity beyond the expiration dates listed in the table below. In addition to patent protection, certain of our products are entitled to regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and the EU. For more information regarding regulatory exclusivity for our products, see the summary of our commercial products under “Overview” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

With respect to our clinical product candidates, we believe we have the necessary intellectual property rights to allowing us to undertake the development of these candidates. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate and whether we and our outside counsel believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
Government Regulation
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, commercialization, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Our industry is subject to significant federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In the U.S., failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Our products require approval from the FDA, the EMA and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed.
Approval Process in the U.S. and EU
Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. and the EU typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the applicable regulatory agency of an application (e.g., an IND or a CTA), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which marketing approval is sought. Currently, European clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new European Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is expected to take effect in 2021, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Satisfaction of FDA and European pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA and/or EMA regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol are submitted to the applicable regulatory agency as part of an IND or CTA. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND or CTA is submitted. Until the CTA or IND is approved, or becomes effective following a waiting period, we may not start the clinical trial in the relevant jurisdiction.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations, good clinical practices (GCP), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the relevant regulatory agency in the EU as part of a new CTA.
The regulatory agencies may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents 
an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee, for approval. An IRB/ethics committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/ethics committee’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs, BLAs or MAAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. After completion of the required clinical testing, an application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency. Approval of the application by the applicable regulatory agency is required before marketing of the product may begin. In the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (the EEA), an MAA is prepared and, for all orphan designated products, is submitted to the EMA under the centralized application procedure. EC approval of the MAA under the centralized application procedure results in a single marketing authorization that is valid across the EEA. The NDA, BLA or MAA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In the U.S., each NDA or BLA is subject to a significant user fee at the time of submission, unless a waiver is granted by the FDA.
The FDA and the EMA initially review the applications for a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, typically within 30-60 days. The regulatory agency may request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing or validation. Once the submission is accepted, the applicable agency begins an in-depth review. For the FDA, the review period for standard review applications is typically an additional ten months and, for priority review of drugs, that is, drugs that the FDA determines address a significant unmet need and represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, the review period is typically an additional six months in duration. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA/BLA, it issues an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed and the NDA/BLA has been resubmitted, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the EC. If the opinion is favorable, the EC may then adopt a decision to grant marketing authorization. In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application within 15 days of receipt of the negative opinion. The company then has 60 days to provide the CHMP with detailed grounds for requesting the re-examination. Within 60 days of providing this information, the CHMP shall re-examine its opinion. The EC follows the recommendation of the CHMP in almost all cases. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.
During the review period, the FDA and/or the EMA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP regulations and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMPs regulations. Neither the FDA nor the EMA will approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
A marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Combination Products
A combination product is a product comprising (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprising drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product becomes the lead evaluator. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple applications is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. In certain circumstances, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Moreover, there is an increasing trend in the EU requiring public disclosure of development data, in particular clinical trial data. These data were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information; however, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical study data submitted to the EMA in MAAs, including preclinical data, and patient level data, may be subject to public disclosure.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Upon approval of a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA each patent that covers the applicant’s product or FDA approved method of using this product. Those patents are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength(s), route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Alternatively, for a patent covering an approved method of use, an ANDA applicant may submit a statement to the FDA that the company is not seeking approval for the covered use.
If the ANDA applicant has submitted a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new condition of use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug. Both of the five-year and three-year exclusivity periods, as well as any unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book for the listed drug, can be extended by six months if the FDA grants the NDA sponsor a period of pediatric exclusivity based on studies submitted by the sponsor in response to a written request.
Exclusivity for Biologics
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the PPACA), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-licensed product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, though no interchangeable products have been approved to date. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA and EMA to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which in the U.S. is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. In the EU, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or fewer, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these criteria, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application.
Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process are available in the EU, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. Among the benefits of orphan drug designation in the U.S. are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. In the EU, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to 
the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
PRIME Designation
The EMA launched its PRIME regulatory initiative to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by statute or regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The BPCIA provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met.
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the FDA’s fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Under the fast track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate 
endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of a Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trial to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct a required post-approval study or confirm a clinical benefit through a post-marketing study will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements
Following approval, the FDA and the EMA will impose certain post-approval requirements related to a product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of approved products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Moreover, if a company obtains original FDA approval for a product via the accelerated approval pathway, the company will be required to conduct a post-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of the FDA’s marketing approval for a product.
Approved products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA or the EMA, as applicable, before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA or MAA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA/ BLA or MAA supplements as in reviewing NDAs/BLAs and MAAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. Either the FDA or EMA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as the manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biological product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA or the EMA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in the U.S., the PPACA is a sweeping measure intended to improve quality of care, constrain healthcare spending, and expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program.
The PPACA also imposed a fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs under certain conditions). The annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to, or use by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding year. Other provisions of the law have also affected us and have increased certain of our costs. For example, the Medicaid rebate rate was increased and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. Among other things, the PPACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance, and now includes a 70% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or “donut hole.” The law also revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes. In addition, drug manufacturers are required to collect and report annually information on payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Effective January 1, 2022, covered manufacturers will also be required to report on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. The 
reported data are posted in searchable form on a public web site. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. It is still unclear the full impact that the PPACA will have on our business.
There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, former U.S. President Trump signed several Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed legislation repealing the PPACA in its entirety, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the PPACA such as removing penalties for not complying with the PPACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. Additionally, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This case was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and on November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this case. It is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the PPACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the suspension of the 2% Medicare sequester through March 31, 2021. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, at the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. However, it is expected that the Biden administration will also focus on controlling drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Moreover, former U.S. President Trump and President Biden both issued Executive Orders intended to favor government procurement from domestic manufacturers. Former President Trump issued an Executive Order specifically aimed at the procurement of pharmaceutical products, which instructed the federal government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy those and other medical supplies that are manufactured, including the manufacture of the API, in the U.S. It is unclear whether this Executive Order or something similar will be implemented by the Biden Administration.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the U.K.
Following the result of a referendum in 2016, the U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, the U.K. was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement which outlines the future trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU was agreed to in December 2020. While the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the U.K. and the EU there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the U.K. diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. 
Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and will continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates in the U.K. or the EU. Great Britain is no longer covered by the EU’s procedures for obtaining the grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures. A separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs in Great 
Britain. However, for two years from January 1, 2021, the U.K.’s regulator, the MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the EC on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the U.K., Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). The data exclusivity periods in the U.K. are currently in line with those in the EU, but the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future. It is currently unclear whether the MHRA in the U.K. is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the U.K. or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability.
Orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is essentially identical to the position in the EU, but is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain. It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. The PPACA amended the statute so that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, covered manufacturers will also be required to report on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives during the previous year.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states while other states prohibit various 
other marketing-related activities. Other states require submission or disclosure of certain pricing information. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, states including California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include significant penalties, including administrative and criminal sanctions, civil monetary penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion of a company from federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, criminal fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of operations and imprisonment.
Approval Outside of the U.S./EU
For marketing outside the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to non-U.S. regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, can differ from those in the U.S. and the EU and may require us to perform additional preclinical or clinical testing. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. In many countries outside of the U.S., approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any non-U.S. government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the U.K., that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption investigations and penalties.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Because the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans. Governments may regulate access to, prices of or reimbursement levels for our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies.
Third-party payers carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs, examine their medical necessity, and review their cost effectiveness. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain high enough price levels to realize sufficient revenues from our investment in product development. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside of the U.S. our products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Reimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In many countries the government closely regulates drug pricing and reimbursement and often has a significant discretion in determining whether a product will be reimbursed at all and, if it is, how much will be paid. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay patient access to and commercialization of our products. Payers in many countries use a variety of cost-containment measures that can include referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set their own price, mandatory price cuts and rebates. This international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices across countries and some cross-border trade in our products from markets with lower prices. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time.
Government Programs for Marketed Drugs in the U.S.
Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for the quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. For innovator products (i.e., drugs that are marketed under NDAs or BLAs), the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products may also be subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s AMP for a given quarter exceeds the inflation-adjusted baseline AMP, which for most drugs is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch. Since 2017, non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate.
The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS), recently published an interim final rule that establishes a Most Favored Nation(MFN), Model for Medicare Part B drug payment. This regulation would substantially change the drug reimbursement landscape as it bases Medicare Part B payment for 50 selected drugs on prices in non-U.S. countries instead of average sales price (ASP), and establishes a fixed add-on payment in place of the current 6 percent (4.3 percent after sequestration) of ASP. The MFN drug payment amount is expected to be lower than the current ASP-based payment limit because U.S. drug prices are generally the highest in the world. Although the MFN Model interim final rule with comment period was effective as of November 27, 2020, and the model payment methodology was scheduled to begin on January 1, 2021, it faces uncertain prospects for implementation. To date, three federal courts have granted orders preventing implementation of the rule. In addition to these lawsuits, the Biden administration, which has implemented a regulatory freeze, or additional litigation challenging the regulation could delay or halt the implementation of the rule.
Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, starting in 2020, Medicare Part D beneficiaries pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D.
Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS 
pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for significant civil monetary penalties per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,059 full-time employees worldwide, 1,343 of whom were in operations, 664 of whom were in research and development, 550 of whom were in sales and marketing and 502 of whom were in administration. Of the 3,059 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020, 2,162 employees were in the U.S. and Canada, and 897 employees were in other non-U.S. countries, including 718 in Europe and the Middle East, 117 in Latin America and 62 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to fill short-term positions for our business and manufacturing needs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our global workforce is currently working remotely. However, a portion of our employee base in the U.S. and Ireland continues to work onsite supporting manufacturing and laboratory operations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
At BioMarin, prejudice, racism and intolerance are unacceptable. We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across all aspects of our organization, including hiring, promotion and development practices. As of December 31, 2020, racial and ethnic minorities represented 46% of our employees in the U.S. Globally, 50% of our workforce were women and 46% of our positions at director-level and above were held by women. We are committed to continuing our ongoing efforts to ensure diversity in all positions, including leadership.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a community that reflects equality and inclusiveness and working towards making BioMarin a place where every employee feels heard, respected and valued. This commitment is a cultural value, and we believe incorporating and encouraging different perspectives from employees of varied backgrounds and experiences helps us better achieve our business goals and objectives. In 2020, we formed a DEI Employee Advisory Committee to help us define our DEI roadmap and ensure that perspectives from employees of different age, tenure, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, level and location are considered in how we build the most inclusive environment. We also continue to support and increase the number of our employee resource groups that build community for employees from underrepresented groups. 
We are honored to be recognized as a company of choice. In January 2021, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Equality by the Human Rights Campaign, scoring 100% on their Corporate Equality Index, one of the foremost benchmarking surveys and reports in the U.S. measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality. 
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We offer competitive compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain excellent people and support our employees’ overall well-being. Our total rewards compensation package includes market-competitive salary, the potential to earn bonuses or sales commissions, equity, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, fitness and wellness programs, free flu vaccinations and an Employee Assistance Program and other mental health services.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a comprehensive global plan that established clear and standardized COVID-19 policies, safety protocols and updates to all employees. We implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These include having the majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical onsite work. We also instituted a policy prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees. As part of our response to the changes implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established additional employee support programs to support the transition to remote working and to provide financial support and time-off for working parents. In addition, policies and programs were established to help support our onsite manufacturing and laboratory staff, including safety screening, onsite COVID-19 testing and financial support for employees who incurred additional expenses related to higher commuting costs, fitness facility closures, personal purchase of supplies and equipment, and increased childcare demands.
We believe people should be paid for the value of their work, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or other protected characteristics. To this end, we benchmark and tie compensation to market data as well as to an employee’s experience, function, and performance. We regularly review our workforce compensation practices and strive for equity. Specifically, we partner with independent, third-party experts to conduct a regular and detailed pay equity assessment to determine whether gender and race/ethnicity have a significant impact on pay levels across the organization. This pay equity analysis is conducted on an employee’s total compensation, including base pay, bonus, and equity. If we identify any pay gap across the organization, we typically make adjustments to mitigate such gaps. Our managers also receive training in how to recognize and prevent discrimination in hiring, performance management and compensation decisions.
Professional Growth and Development
We help our employees develop the skills and capabilities to support BioMarin’s growth and innovation. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide them with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual and self-directed learning, mentoring, mobile coaching and external development. We offer our employees career-specific training and resources and support development opportunities through company sponsored programs in addition to our tuition reimbursement program. We also provide our high-potential employees with a variety of leadership coaching and management programs.
Patient and Community Connections
We are striving to support our local communities around the world by developing programs that inspire and enrich both our patient populations and the areas where we live and work. We actively engage with underrepresented populations through a variety of outreach and programs. We have collaborated with Biotech Partners, a non-profit organization in the San Francisco Bay Area focused on helping students underrepresented in the biotechnology field to gain experience through classroom instruction and paid internships. In addition, we have a partnership with Health Career Connection, a national non-profit that prepares the next generation of diverse, transformational health, equity, and racial justice leaders, by providing promising undergraduate college students from underrepresented backgrounds and under resourced communities with paid internship programs, health equity scholars programs and alumni professional development initiatives. Through our Rare Scholars program, we award annual scholarships to students living with rare disease.
