Item 1. Business. 
 We are a commercial-stage, fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of people affected by rare diseases through ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, gene therapies. Our gene therapy approach seeks to transform a patient’s own, or autologous, HSCs into a gene-modified cellular drug product to treat the patient’s disease through a single administration. We achieve this outcome by utilizing a lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of a missing or faulty gene into the patient’s autologous HSCs through an ex vivo process, resulting in a drug product that can then be administered to the patient at the bedside. 
 To date, over 170 patients have been treated with our commercial product and clinical-stage product candidates across seven different diseases, with follow-up periods of more than 18 years following a single administration. We believe the data observed across these programs, in combination with our deep expertise in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of gene and cell therapies, position us to provide potentially transformative therapies to people suffering from a broad range of diseases. 
 We are currently focusing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach on three therapeutic rare disease franchise areas: primary immune deficiencies, neurometabolic disorders and blood disorders. Our portfolio includes Strimvelis, our commercial-stage gammaretroviral-based product approved in Europe for the treatment of adenosine deaminase-severe combined immunodeficiency, or ADA-SCID, seven lentiviral-based product candidates in clinical-stage development and several other product candidates in preclinical development. Our three lead clinical programs, OTL-200 for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, OTL-101 for the treatment of ADA-SCID, and OTL-103 for the treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or WAS, have a combined annual incidence rate of between 700 and 1,300 patients in markets around the world where treatments for rare diseases are often reimbursed. We believe the total market opportunity in the disease areas underlying these three programs could be greater than $1.5 billion annually based on incidence alone.  If we take into account prevalent populations of people living with these diseases who could be eligible for our treatments upon receiving marketing approval, our market opportunity could be increased.  
 For each of our lead product candidates, we are in ongoing discussions with the applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the clinical and other data required for regulatory submissions.  We filed a marketing authorization application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for OTL-200 for the treatment of MLD in 2019, and we anticipate filing a biologics license application, or BLA, with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, for OTL-200 for the same indication by 2021.  We plan to make additional regulatory submissions over the next two years with the FDA for OTL-101 for the treatment of ADA-SCID and with the FDA and EMA for OTL-103 for the treatment of WAS. 
 We believe our approach of using lentiviral vectors to genetically modify HSCs has wide-ranging applicability to a large number of indications. The ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple cell types allows us to deliver gene-modified cells to multiple physiological systems, including the central nervous system, immune system and red blood cell and platelet lineage, thereby potentially enabling the correction of a wide range of diseases. By leveraging the innate self-renewing capability of HSCs that are engrafted in the bone marrow as well as the ability of lentiviral vectors to achieve stable integration of a modified gene into the chromosomes of HSCs, our gene therapies have the potential to provide a durable effect following a single administration.

We have a broad and advanced portfolio of commercial- and development-stage products and product candidates. Our neurometabolic disorders franchise consists of one advanced registrational clinical program, OTL-200 for MLD, two clinical proof of concept-stage programs, OTL-203 for mucopolysaccharidosis type I, or MPS-I, and OTL-201 for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, or MPS-IIIA, and a preclinical program, OTL-202 for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, or MPS-IIIB. Our primary immune deficiencies franchise consists of our commercial program approved in Europe, Strimvelis for ADA-SCID, two advanced registrational clinical programs, OTL-101 for ADA-SCID and OTL-103 for WAS, and one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-102 for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, or X-CGD. Our blood disorders franchise consists of one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-300 for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, or TDT. See “—Our pipeline.”
 Due to the nature of our gene therapy product candidates and the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare or ultra-rare indications, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration without having to conduct one or more Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers or Phase 3 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials. For purposes of this Annual Report, we refer to an exploratory study, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as a proof of concept trial, and a confirmatory efficacy and safety study to support submission of a potential marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial, as a registrational trial. See “—Our regulatory strategy.”
 The diseases we are targeting affect patients around the world, requiring an infrastructure to deliver gene therapies globally. We are therefore building a commercial-scale manufacturing infrastructure and leveraging technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally in a fully-integrated manner. In order to meet anticipated demand for our growing pipeline of product candidates and planned product offerings, we are initially utilizing our existing network of contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture lentiviral vectors and drug product. In addition, we have established process development capabilities in Menlo Park, California and in London, UK, and plan to build an integrated facility in Fremont, California to accommodate our expanding process development and create in-house drug product and vector manufacturing capabilities. 
 Cryopreservation of our gene-modified HSCs is a key component of our strategy to deliver potentially transformative gene therapies to patients worldwide, facilitating both local treatment and local product reimbursement. In anticipation of commercialization, we have developed cryopreserved formulations of our three most advanced product candidates and are collecting supportive clinical data from patients treated with cryopreserved formulations to support the analytical comparability analysis to the fresh cell formulations used in our registrational trials. The registrational trials for all our earlier stage product candidates will be conducted using one of our cryopreserved formulations.
 We have global commercial rights to all our clinical product candidates and plan to commercialize our gene therapies in key markets worldwide, including the United States and Europe initially, subject to obtaining the necessary marketing approvals for these jurisdictions. We plan to deploy a focused commercial infrastructure to deliver our product candidates to patients and are focused on working closely with all relevant stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, specialist physicians and payors, to ensure the widest possible post-approval access for our product candidates.

As we continue to develop and expand our portfolio, we believe that the deep experience of our management team and our extensive academic relationships are key strategic strengths. Our management team has extensive experience in rare diseases and in the manufacturing, preclinical and clinical development and commercialization of gene and cell therapies. In addition, we partner with leading academic institutions, which are pioneers in ex vivo autologous HSC-based gene therapy. We plan to leverage our internal expertise combined with our relationships with leading academic institutions to transition our lead clinical-stage product candidates to commercialization and continue to expand our portfolio of ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy products for rare diseases. 
 Our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach 
 Our ex vivo HSC gene therapy approach seeks to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs into a gene-modified cellular drug product to treat the patient’s disease. HSCs are self-renewing cells that are capable of differentiating into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets and tissue resident macrophages, which include the microglia of the central nervous system. HSCs can be obtained directly from the bone marrow, which requires administration of a general anesthetic, or from the patient’s peripheral blood with the use of mobilizing agents, which are agents that can move HSCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. By delivering gene-modified HSCs back to patients, we seek to take advantage of the self-renewing capability of HSCs to enable a durable effect following a single administration, as has been seen in our commercial and development programs. In addition, the ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple different cell types has the potential to enable the delivery of gene-modified cells to different physiological systems and allow the correction of a broad range of different diseases. 
 Clinical validation already exists for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, an approach of treating a patient with a genetic disease with HSCs contributed by a healthy donor individual, thereby using HSCs that contain a functioning copy of the gene of interest. However, this approach has significant limitations, including difficulties in finding appropriate genetically matched donors and the risk of graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related rejection and mortality from these and other complications, and is therefore typically only offered on a limited basis. Furthermore, genetically modified cells can be used to express enzyme activity at supra-physiological levels, which we believe has the potential to overcome the limitations of HSCT (where enzyme expression is necessarily at normal levels) to treat some neurometabolic disorders and improve the metabolic correction in neuronal cells before irreversible degeneration occurs. Our approach is intended to address these significant limitations of HSCT. 
 The following discussion is an example of the potential of our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach to deliver genes to different physiological systems. In a preclinical study conducted by one of our scientific advisors and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, or PNAS, a subpopulation of gene-modified HSCs has evidenced the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain as microglia and express genes and proteins within the central nervous system. As published in PNAS, the image below shows a cross-section of the brain of a mouse that was infused intravenously with HSCs, which had been genetically modified using a lentiviral vector carrying green fluorescent protein, or GFP. The GFP expression observed throughout the brain illustrates the potential of gene-modified HSCs to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain and express the functional protein throughout the brain, thereby potentially addressing a range of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Our OTL-200 program for MLD leverages this same mechanism of action to deliver gene-modified HSCs that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver a therapeutic gene that can prevent neuronal degeneration. The figure below shows widespread distribution and expression of GFP in the brain of a mouse model following intravenous administration of HSCs transduced with GFP encoding vector.

With respect to each of our product candidates, our ex vivo gene therapy approach utilizes a non-replicating lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of the missing or faulty gene into the patient’s autologous HSCs through an ex vivo process called transduction, resulting in a cellular drug product that can then be re-introduced into the patient. Unlike some other viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viral, or AAV, vectors, lentiviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of patients’ HSCs. We believe this allows us to achieve stable integration of the functional gene into the HSCs and can lead to durable expression of the target protein by the gene-modified HSCs and their progeny after a single administration of gene therapy. Strimvelis, our commercial-stage product, utilizes a non-replicating gammaretroviral vector. 
 The image below illustrates the steps in our approach to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs ex vivo into therapeutic product. 

Initial clinical trials conducted using our product candidates utilized a fresh product formulation, resulting in a limited drug product shelf life. We plan to market our current and future product candidates, if approved, in a cryopreserved product formulation, which is designed to extend the drug product shelf life and enable the shipment of the drug product to specialized treatment centers throughout the world, allowing patients to receive treatment closer to their home. Cryopreservation also allows us to conduct a number of quality control tests on the genetically modified HSCs prior to introducing them into the patient. 
 7


In addition, certain of our clinical-stage product candidates have been evaluated in registrational trials using drug product derived from HSCs extracted from the patients’ bone marrow. To optimize our potential product label and the number of patients that we may be able to treat, as part of any BLA or MAA submission for such product candidates, we plan to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ bone marrow. In cases where clinical trials were conducted using vector and/or drug product manufactured at academic centers, we plan to demonstrate comparability between vector and/or drug product manufactured by our selected third party commercial CDMOs with vector and drug product manufactured at such academic centers. 
 Initially, we are employing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach in three franchise areas: primary immune deficiencies, neurometabolic disorders and blood disorders. Data from clinical trials suggest that ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy has the potential to provide well-tolerated, sustainable and improved outcomes over existing standards of care for diseases in these franchise areas. We believe that we can apply our approach beyond our initial target indications to treat an even broader range of diseases. 
 Our strategy 
 Our mission is to transform the lives of patients with rare genetic diseases using our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach. We are building a leading, global, fully-integrated gene therapy company focused on serious and life-threatening diseases. To achieve this, we are pursuing the following strategies:

 Our pipeline 
 Our advanced portfolio of ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapies targets serious and life-threatening rare diseases, currently focusing on primary immune deficiencies, neurometabolic disorders and blood disorders. Our primary immune deficiencies franchise consists of our commercial program approved in Europe, Strimvelis for ADA-SCID, two advanced registrational clinical programs, OTL-101 for ADA-SCID and OTL-103 for WAS, and one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-102 for X-CGD. Our neurometabolic disorders franchise consists of one advanced registrational clinical program, OTL-200 for MLD, two clinical proof of concept-stage programs, OTL-203 for MPS-I and OTL-201 for MPS-IIIA, and a preclinical program, OTL-202 for MPS-IIIB. Our blood disorders franchise consists of one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-300 for TDT.

The status of these programs is outlined below:

Gene therapy for treatment of ADA-SCID 
 Disease overview 
 Severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease of the immune system. ADA-SCID is a specific form of SCID, commonly known as “bubble-baby disease,” caused by mutations in the ADA gene, resulting in a lack of, or minimal, immune system development, which leaves the patient vulnerable to severe and recurrent bacterial, viral and fungal infections. The first symptoms of ADA-SCID typically manifest during infancy with recurrent severe bacterial, viral and fungal infections and overall failure to thrive, and without treatment the condition can be fatal within the first two years of life. The lack of a functional ADA gene in ADA-SCID patients can also lead to neurological deficits involving motor function, deafness, liver dysfunction and eventual failure, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. 
 The incidence of ADA-SCID in the United States is currently estimated to be between one in 200,000 and one in 1 million live births. Higher incidence rates are reported in geographies of higher consanguinity, such as Turkey and the Middle East. 
 Patients with ADA-SCID are most commonly diagnosed during the first six months of life based on recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, persistent lymphopenia, and ADA activity below 1%. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiencies, including ADA-SCID, has now been adopted in all 50 states in the United States, as well as in other jurisdictions, including several Canadian provinces, Israel, Taiwan, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 The primary treatment options for ADA-SCID are HSCT and enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT. Although HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for ADA-SCID patients, this procedure is associated with a high risk of complications and mortality, with one-year survival rates of 43%, 67% and 86% for transplants from haploidentical donors, human leukocyte antigen, or HLA,-matched unrelated donors and HLA-matched sibling donors, respectively. 
 Chronic ERT is a palliative treatment for ADA-SCID patients and involves weekly or bi-weekly intra-muscular infusions. ERT with pegylated adenosine deaminase has been approved by the FDA and is commercialized in the United States. It is only available on a named patient use basis in Europe. Although ERT can temporarily restore immune function by maintaining high ADA levels in the plasma, many patients receiving chronic ERT therapy continue to have abnormally low levels of lymphocytes in the blood after the first year of treatment, and 50% of patients therefore require supplementary immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Chronic ERT has been associated with a 78% survival rate at 20 years; however, significant morbidity or mortality may occur as early as one to three years after the first treatment. Patients on ERT may experience refractory hemolytic anemia, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Our solutions, OTL-101 and Strimvelis for treatment of ADA-SCID
 We are developing OTL-101 as an ex vivo autologous lentiviral gene therapy to treat patients with ADA-SCID through a single administration. OTL-101 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood that is genetically modified to introduce a functional copy of the ADA gene using a lentiviral vector. The gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a mild conditioning regimen. 
 OTL-101 has been investigated in multiple clinical trials in the United States and Europe. As of January 2020, 66 patients have been treated with a drug product manufactured with the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector, with a maximum follow-up of approximately 8 years post treatment. Based on our ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect our BLA submission will include data from our the registrational trial being conducted by University of California Los Angeles, or UCLA, of 20 patients treated with a fresh product formulation of OTL-101, supportive data derived from a clinical trial of 10 patients treated with a cryopreserved formulation at UCLA and additional data derived from a clinical trial of 10 patients treated with a fresh product formulation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, or GOSH, as well as any other patients with adequate follow-up at the time of submission. See “—Regulatory Pathway for OTL-101.” The remaining 26 patients treated as of January 2020 represent compassionate use patients or patients for whom we do not have adequate follow-up as of the date of this Annual Report but for which safety data is presented in the summary below. Among the 66 patients treated, four patients, including those treated under compassionate use and additional supportive studies, did not engraft or had to resume ERT and/or receive rescue bone marrow transplant.
 In the European Union, our commercial program Strimvelis is available as the only approved gene therapy option for patients with ADA-SCID. The EMA approved Strimvelis in May 2016 for treatment of children with ADA-SCID with no suitable HLA-matched stem cell donor. Strimvelis consists of HSCs transduced with a gammaretroviral vector encoding the human adenosine deaminase cDNA sequence. Strimvelis is available in fresh product formulation at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, and has a shelf-life of up to six hours. We plan to continue to make Strimvelis available to eligible patients as we advance OTL-101 as an ex vivo autologous lentiviral gene therapy for ADA-SCID. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to the OTL-101 program through our UCLB/UCLA license agreement and we obtained worldwide rights to the Strimvelis program through our asset purchase and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development LTD, or, together, GSK. 
 OTL-101 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of ADA-SCID and Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. OTL-101 has also received a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. We expect to initiate a rolling BLA for OTL-101 with the FDA in the first half of 2020 with anticipated completion of the filing within 12 months of initiation. 
 Registrational, supportive and ongoing additional clinical trials 
 OTL-101 has been evaluated in a registrational trial conducted by UCLA in the United States using a fresh product formulation and has also been evaluated in a supportive clinical trial at UCLA using a cryopreserved formulation. These trials were initially conducted under an investigator-sponsored investigational new drug application, or IND, to which we hold the license. A fresh product formulation was evaluated in a concurrent additional investigator-sponsored clinical trial conducted by GOSH in Europe. These clinical trials enrolled ADA-SCID patients between one month and 18 years of age who were ineligible for HSCT due to the absence of an HLA-matched sibling or family member to serve as an allogenic bone marrow donor. 
 Registrational trial conducted by UCLA (“UCLA Fresh study”)
 Our anticipated rolling BLA submission for OTL-101 will include data from 20 enrolled and treated patients in a registrational trial conducted by UCLA for which follow-up completed in August 2018. Production of the fresh OTL-101 drug product formulation (with bone marrow as the cellular source) used in this clinical trial was performed onsite at UCLA and at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for one patient. In this clinical trial, all patients were treated with ERT prior to enrollment and continued ERT until 30 days following their treatment with OTL-101.
The primary goals of this clinical trial were to assess the safety and efficacy of OTL-101 in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial included immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. 
 10


Overall survival and event-free survival of 100% was observed at 12 months post-treatment, the primary endpoint of the trial. None of the enrolled patients required rescue medication, HSCT, or resumption of ERT. As summarized in the charts below, these patients’ data were compared with a historical cohort of ADA-SCID, for which patients 0 to 18 years of age were eligible, who received treatment with allogeneic bone marrow transplant between 2000 and 2016 (n=26). These data were gathered retrospectively from Great Ormond Street Hospital and Duke University Hospital. Comparator populations from this group were ADA-SCID patients without an eligible HLA-matched related donor, patients with an HLA-matched related donor, or MRD, and the complete group. 
 When comparing the overall survival for the OTL-101 treated patients with the historical control group, OTL-101 treated patients achieved a higher overall survival rate at 24 months (100%) versus the combined group that received allogeneic bone marrow transplant (88%) (95% CI: 69-97%). A confidence interval, or CI, is a range of values in which, statistically, there is a specified level of confidence that the true rate falls within this range. Small sample sizes will yield wider confidence intervals. In this trial, the results indicate that there is a 95% level of confidence that the overall survival rate for OTL-101 at the 24-month timepoint was between 83% and 100%, which we represent as (95% CI: 83%-100%). 
 OTL-101 (ADA-SCID): Summary of Overall Survival (n=20) at 24 months

As summarized in the chart below, event-free survival is defined as survival without resumption of PEG-ADA ERT or need for rescue allogeneic HSCT. Event-free survival in the OTL-101 treatment group was 100% at 24 months. In comparison, event-free survival in the combined allogeneic HSCT group was 56% (95% CI: 34.9-75.6%) at 24 months. For the primary comparator group, who received allogeneic HSCT without a matched related donor, event-free survival rates had differences of 50% (95% CI: 22.71-76.96%) compared to the OTL-101 treated group at 24 months. Because the 95% confidence intervals for the estimates of the difference from the OTL-101 treated group do not include zero, these are statistically meaningful differences between the OTL-101 treated group and the HSCT without a matched related donor comparator group. Similarly, event-free survival rates in the comparator HSCT group that received a matched related donor (the current standard of care) had differences of 36.36% (95% CI: 9.80-69.21%) compared to the OTL-101 treated group at 24 months. Because the 95% confidence intervals for this estimate does not include zero, this also represents a statistically meaningful difference between the OTL-101 treated group and the comparator HSCT with a matched related donor. 
 OTL-101 (ADA-SCID): Summary of Event-Free Survival (n=20) at 24 months

Importantly, patients in this trial showed immune cell reconstitution following treatment with OTL-101, which can lead to restoration of both cellular and humoral immune responses. As of the final study report, the severe infection rates across the full post treatment period were lower in the OTL-101 treatment group compared with the HSCT controls combined. Additionally, by Month 24, a considerably higher proportion of subjects in the OTL-101 treatment group (90%) had stopped immunoglobulin replacement therapy compared with HSCT controls combined (55%).

Supportive clinical trial with UCLA (with cryopreserved formulation) (“UCLA Cryo study”)
 A cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101 (with bone marrow as cellular source) is currently being evaluated in a supportive clinical trial at UCLA. Enrollment for this trial is complete and of 10 patients treated, 9 have completed their final 24-month study visit as of September 2019 and these data are currently being evaluated. One patient treated in this trial, who did not engraft, restarted ERT, was withdrawn from the trial, and later received a rescue hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The aim of this clinical trial was to provide clinical data supportive of the analytical chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, comparison of the fresh and cryopreserved drug product formulations. As of an earlier data-cut off in February 2019, when 7 patients had reached 18 months of follow-up, key biological parameters of engraftment and efficacy (including medians of VCN in granulocytes and CD3+ T lymphocyte counts and ADA enzyme activity) were consistent when compared across the UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies and remained consistent throughout follow-up, as presented below.
Median ADA Activity (Interquartile Range)

We believe this consistency between the UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies is supportive of ongoing analytical comparability data between the fresh and cryopreserved formulations of OTL-101. We are continuing to evaluate the data from this ongoing trial and will include the data available at the time of submission to support our BLA and MAA submissions.

Additional clinical data from GOSH 
 In a parallel investigator-sponsored trial being conducted by GOSH, 10 enrolled patients have been treated with fresh product formulation (with bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source). The drug product used in this clinical trial is produced using the same vector as at UCLA, but with a manufacturing process with minor differences to that for OTL-101. Production of the fresh formulation of the drug product used in this clinical trial was performed onsite at GOSH. In this clinical trial, all patients were being treated with ERT prior to enrollment and all but one patient continued ERT until 30 days following initial treatment with ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy.
The primary goals of this clinical trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial include immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. 
 As of September 2017, overall survival of 100% has been observed at 12 months post treatment in the 10 patients enrolled, and nine patients have achieved event-free survival, with only one patient resuming ERT after 12.2 months due to a failure to engraft. We believe this failure to engraft may in part be attributable to the patient’s early discontinuation of ERT prior to treatment in contravention of the trial protocol, but may also relate to other clinical factors. The last study patient has completed their 36-month follow-up but the final study data are not available as of the date of this Annual Report.
 There is a second investigator-sponsored trial being conducted by GOSH, aiming to enroll 10 patients treated with cryopreserved product formulation with mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source. The drug product used in this clinical trial is produced using the same vector and same manufacturing process as the drug product being evaluated at UCLA. Production of the cryopreserved formulation of the drug product used in this clinical trial is performed onsite at GOSH. In this clinical trial, all patients are being treated with ERT prior to enrollment and continue ERT until 30 days following initial treatment with ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy. 
 The primary goals of this clinical trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial include immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. As of January 2020, nine patients are alive and no longer being treated with ERT. 
 OTL-101 program safety 
 As of August 2019, the data cut-off for the last safety update report, safety data from the 30 patients treated in the registrational and supportive trials (UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo, respectively) in the United States indicate that OTL-101 was generally well-tolerated, with no instances of insertional mutagenesis in follow-ups ranging from 17.9 months to 26 months in those who had successful engraftment. A total of 35 serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported from both the UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies, of which 1 was assessed by the investigator as being possibly related to treatment due to contamination of OTL-101 protocol treatment or procedures.  This SAE was a staphylococcal infection from the patient’s transduced bone marrow cells in the UCLA Fresh study. The patient was treated with antibiotics and recovered. The most common SAEs were infections and gastrointestinal disorders. All SAEs resolved with standard treatments, including two cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, also assessed as unrelated to OTL-101 by the investigators, and which resolved with corticosteroids. Because follow-up is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change until closure of both studies. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigators of any serious, unexpected and related event, or SUSAR, in either clinical trial. 
 As of August 2019, the data cut-off for the last safety update report, out of the 3 compassionate use patients treated at UCLA, one with fresh drug product and two with cryopreserved drug product, 5 SAEs were reported and were not deemed to be related to OTL-101. All SAEs resolved with standard of care treatment. Because follow-up is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. 
 In Europe, as of August 2019, the data cut-off for the last safety update report, safety data from the 10 patients treated in the additional clinical trial with GOSH and from the 10 compassionate use patients, indicate that the investigational drug product was generally well-tolerated, with no instances of insertional mutagenesis up to six years post treatment. There were 21 SAEs reported in eight subjects in this additional clinical trial with GOSH, none of which were assessed by the investigator as being possibly related to the protocol treatment, and seven SAEs reported in four patients in the compassionate use program, one of which, a product contamination, was deemed by the investigator as being possibly related to protocol treatment. This SAE was a staphylococcal infection, possibly resulting from a bacterial growth noted in samples of the fresh drug product taken during the transduction procedure at this academic facility. The most common SAEs across this additional clinical trial and compassionate use program were pyrexia, infections and immune system disorders. There were no adverse events, or AEs, or SAEs leading to the withdrawal of patients from the additional clinical trial and compassionate use program. All SAEs resolved with standard of care treatment. Because follow-up is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigator of any SUSAR. 
 13


In an ongoing cryopreserved study in the United Kingdom, where eight of ten patients had been treated by the August 2019 data cut-off for the last safety update report, there were eight SAEs reported, none of which were deemed to be related to the drug product. At the same data cut off, in three patients treated under compassionate use with cryopreserved formulation, eleven SAEs have been reported, none of which were deemed to be related to the product. Because follow-up is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigator of any SUSAR. 
 Regulatory pathway for OTL-101 
 We are currently planning to initiate the BLA rolling submission for OTL-101 in 2020. We expect that our BLA submission will include clinical data from the registrational trial of 20 patients treated with a fresh product formulation in the UCLA Fresh study, data from the supportive  trial of ten patients treated with a cryopreserved formulation in the UCLA Cryo study, additional data from the clinical trial of 10 patients treated with a fresh product formulation at GOSH, and any other patients with adequate follow-up at the time of submission. A global observational long-term follow-up study is now open. Per regulatory requirements, this study is designed to collect safety and efficacy data from ADA-SCID patients previously treated with autologous ex vivo gene therapy products based on the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector up to 15 years post gene therapy. 
 We have completed a final clinical study report for our registrational trial, and we are currently preparing the final clinical report for our supportive clinical trial to support the analytical comparability data between fresh and cryopreserved drug product formulations. 
 Discussions with FDA on the CMC data package for the BLA have been completed. This data includes analytical comparability between academic and commercial manufacturing processes, vector and drug product process characterization as well as vector and drug product manufacturing state of control and/or process validation. We will initially seek approval of OTL-101 using patient bone marrow as cellular source material and subsequently seek approval for the use of mobilized peripheral blood, as an alternative cellular source material. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—“The results from our clinical trials for OTL-101 for ADA-SCID, OTL-200 for MLD, OTL-103 for WAS and for any of our other product candidates may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission or granting of marketing approval for our product candidates,” “We may be unable to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability between drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product” and “To date, most of the clinical trials for our product candidates were conducted as investigator sponsored clinical trials using drug product manufactured at the academic sites.”  
 Gene therapy for treatment of MLD 
 Disease overview 
 MLD is a rare and rapidly progressive neurometabolic disorder. MLD is caused by a mutation in the ARSA gene, leading to a deficiency in the enzyme arylsulfatase A, or ARSA, and the accumulation of sulfatides, resulting in the progressive destruction of myelin in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Prognosis is severe, with continuous neurodegeneration and rapid deterioration of motor functions and cognitive impairment. In late-infantile MLD, the most common and severe form of the disease representing approximately 40-60% of all MLD patients, symptoms are generally first observed before three years of age, and the rate of mortality by five years of age is estimated at 50%. In juvenile MLD, representing approximately 20-35% of all MLD patients, symptoms are generally first observed between three and 16 years of age, and the five-year and ten-year survival rates are 70% and 44%, respectively. In adult MLD, representing approximately 10-25% of all MLD patients, the onset of symptoms generally occurs after 16 years of age. Symptoms often manifest in late-infantile and early-juvenile MLD patients as gait abnormalities and/or missed development milestones. Educational and behavioral symptoms may also accompany gait and motor decline for early-juvenile patients. Adult-onset MLD is often diagnosed through cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric pathologies, such as alcohol or drug use, or difficulty managing emotions resulting in psychiatric evaluation. Adult-onset MLD patients may also demonstrate bewilderment, inappropriate response to their surroundings, paranoia, dementia or auditory hallucinations. 
 The incidence of MLD is currently estimated at between 1.4 in 100,000 and 1.8 in 100,000 live births per year.

Limitations of current therapies 
 Currently, there are no effective treatments or approved therapies for MLD. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MLD but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. HSCT has limited and variable efficacy in arresting disease progression and, as a result, HSCT is not considered to be a standard of care for this disease. Given the severity of the disease and the lack of effective treatments, significant burden remains for MLD patients, their caregivers and families, and the healthcare system. 
 Our solution, OTL-200 for treatment of MLD 
 We are developing OTL-200 as an ex vivo autologous HSC-based gene therapy to treat patients with MLD through a single administration. OTL-200 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow, modified to add a functional ARSA gene using a lentiviral vector. The gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The gene-modified HSCs have the capacity to migrate to the brain, differentiate into microglia in the brain tissue and secrete ARSA to treat the disease within the central nervous system. 
 To date, we have treated only late infantile, or LI, and early juvenile, or EJ, patients in our clinical trials of OTL-200. As of January 2020, a total of 36 patients have been treated with OTL-200 drug product, with a maximum follow-up of approximately eight years post treatment, comprised of 20 patients in our registrational trial with a fresh product formulation, seven patients in our supportive study with a cryopreserved formulation and nine patients treated under a compassionate use program with a fresh product formulation. Based on our clinical data to date, we believe OTL-200 has shown the potential to preserve motor function and cognitive development in MLD patients. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to this program through our asset purchase and license agreement with GSK, or the GSK Agreement. The clinical trials for this program have been conducted under a GSK-sponsored clinical trial authorization, or CTA, which was transferred to us during the third quarter of 2018. 
 OTL-200 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of MLD. OTL-200 has also received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. We submitted an MAA for OTL-200 with the EMA in November 2019, which was validated in December 2019. Accelerated assessment was granted by EMA for the MAA. We plan to submit a BLA with the FDA in late 2020 or early 2021. 
 Registrational trial 
 Our MAA submission and anticipated BLA submission for OTL-200 will be supported by data from 29 patients with pre-symptomatic LI MLD, or pre- to early-symptomatic EJ MLD.  Twenty of these patients were treated in a registrational trial and nine of the patients were treated under compassionate use programs following the same protocol as the registrational trial at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, for which follow-up is ongoing. In this registrational trial, both the late-infantile and early-juvenile patient groups have achieved the co-primary endpoints at 24 months follow-up. Manufacture of the fresh OTL-200 drug product formulation (with bone marrow and/or mobilized peripheral blood as cellular source) was performed by a third-party commercial CDMO. 
 The primary goals of this clinical trial were to assess the efficacy of OTL-200, as measured by gross motor function and ARSA activity levels in the patients’ blood cells 24 months post-treatment, and safety and tolerability of OTL-200 in MLD patients. Secondary goals for this clinical trial included assessment of cognitive function through neuropsychological assessments and instrumental markers of efficacy, such as brain MRI and nerve conduction velocity. The trial also provides for a follow-up period through 8 years’ post-treatment. 
 Presented below are efficacy data from an integrated analysis of all 29 patients treated in this clinical trial and compassionate use programs as of November 2019, the date of the most recent integrated efficacy data report available to us. Motor function was measured in this trial with a GMFM score, which measures a child’s ability to perform standard motor tasks including lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling, standing, and walking, and running and jumping. Healthy children with normal motor development typically reach approximately 100% GMFM score by 3-4 years of age and maintain this score. Following treatment with OTL-200, patients achieved a statistically significant difference on the co-primary endpoint of improvement of >10% of the total GMFM score in treated subjects when compared to the natural history (untreated) cohort at Year 2, and these were maintained through Year 3. At 36 months post-treatment, an average GMFM score of 74.3% was observed in late-infantile patients (n=10) treated in this clinical trial compared to 2.8% in the untreated natural history population. For EJ MLD patients treated in this clinical trial (n=10), an average GMFM score of 72.9% was observed at 36 months post-treatment, compared to 16.3% in the natural history population.

In addition, reconstitution of ARSA activity in the hematopoietic system was observed in OTL-200 treated patients, stabilizing at normal to supra-physiological levels within 3 to 6 months post-treatment. At year 2 post-gene therapy, statistically significant increases in ARSA activity from baseline in total peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) was observed for both the LI (18.7-fold increase; 95% CI: 8.3, 42.2; p<0.001) and EJ (5.7-fold increase; 95% CI: 2.6, 12.4; p<0.001) subgroups, exceeding the pre-specified co-primary endpoint of a significant increase of ≥2 standard deviation in ARSA activity in PBMCs at year 2 compared to baseline values.   At Year 3 post-gene therapy, the increase in ARSA activity in total PBMCs remained stable for both the LI (37.5-fold increase; 95% CI: 17.7, 79.6; p<0.001) and EJ subgroups (11.2-fold increase; 95% CI: 5.7, 21.9; p<0.001).
 Most treated subjects displayed normal acquisition of cognitive developmental skills throughout follow-up.  The cognitive age equivalent score is not a single assessment, but a score derived from a number of neuropsychological tests administered according to the chronological age of the patient. Each neuropsychological instrument includes multiple core tests and supplemental subtests that comprise composite scores in specified cognitive areas. 
 Safety data presented as part of the MAA application showed that of 29 subjects treated as part of a registrational trial or under compassionate use programs, 20 experienced at least one SAE and three subjects died. All three SAEs with a fatal outcome were deemed unrelated to treatment with OTL-200. Two deaths in patients treated after disease onset were attributed to rapid MLD disease progression, and one death in a patient treated before onset of symptoms was attributed to a left hemisphere cerebral ischemic stroke.  SAEs that were most frequently reported were gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations and nervous system disorders. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to OTL-200 but mainly related to myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and to the underlying disease. Overall, the safety findings following treatment with OTL-200 are in line with what would be expected in patients with MLD who have undergone busulfan conditioning and subsequent hematological reconstitution.    
 Ongoing cryopreservation supportive clinical trial 
 A cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 (with bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood as cellular source) is currently being evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial of pediatric patients with pre-symptomatic LI MLD, or pre- to early-symptomatic EJ MLD in Milan, Italy. Enrollment for this trial is ongoing, with seven patients treated as of January 2020 and up to 10 patients expected to be enrolled. 
 The primary goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 in MLD patients, as measured by improvement in gross motor function and ARSA activity levels in the patients’ blood cells as well as overall survival. Secondary goals for this clinical trial include assessment of cognitive function through IQ. 
 Seven patients have been treated in this trial as of January 2020. All patients tolerated the administration well and for those with enough follow-up post-treatment, preliminary evidence of engraftment and restoration of ARSA activity in peripheral blood to supraphysiological levels and in CSF to normal levels has been shown. To date, four SAEs have been reported in this study, none of which were considered related to the gene therapy.
 These clinical data have been used to support the analytical comparability analyses between fresh and cryopreserved formulations that we submitted to EMA as part of our MAA submission.

Regulatory pathway for OTL-200 
 An MAA was submitted for OTL-200 in November 2019 following preliminary meetings with the EMA and the designated rapporteur and co-rapporteur. The EMA confirmed the validation of the application in December 2019. Of note, EMA has granted accelerated assessment for the review of OTL-200’s MAA, potentially reducing the review timeline from 210 to 150 days, assuming no major objections are raised during the MAA assessment or the good clinical practice, or GCP, and current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, inspections which will be conducted as part of the procedure and not counting clock stops for responses to questions. At this stage we envisage that the MAA for OTL-200 could be granted by the European Commission by the end of 2020, although no assurance can be given that the MAA will be granted by this time, or at all.
 In parallel to the European Union registration, we are preparing the BLA for OTL-200. A pre-BLA application has been filed in order to present and discuss the overall clinical development plan as well as key elements of the pharmaceutical package during a meeting to be held at the FDA in the first half of 2020. Depending on the outcome of this meeting, we currently expect to file the BLA by the end of 2020 or early 2021, although no assurance can be given that we will file the BLA by these dates. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors—“The results from our clinical trials for OTL-101 for ADA-SCID, OTL-200 for MLD, OTL-103 for WAS and for any of our other product candidates may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission or granting of marketing approval for our product candidates,” and “We may be unable to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability between drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product.” 
 Gene therapy for treatment of WAS 
 Disease overview 
 WAS is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease affecting the patient’s immune system and platelets leading to recurrent, severe infections and uncontrollable bleeds, which are the leading causes of death in the disease. WAS is referred to as an “X-linked-recessive” disease as it is associated with a genetic defect on the X chromosome. Because it is an X-linked disease, it affects mainly males. Patients with WAS are born with a defect in the gene that produces the WAS protein, or WASP. As a result, they suffer from life-threatening thrombocytopenia and are at risk of severe bleeds, infections, autoimmunity, malignancies and severe eczema. These symptoms require increasingly frequent hospitalizations. The median survival for a patient with WAS is approximately 15 years with patients with early onset WAS generally having a shorter life expectancy. 
 The incidence of WAS is currently estimated at approximately four in 1 million live male births. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Treatment options for WAS include conservative care with prophylactic anti-infective medicines, which are not always effective in preventing severe infections requiring antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and intravenous immunoglobulin, as well as chronic platelet transfusions to prevent severe bleeding. WAS patients often are prescribed chronic oral medications or topical steroids and may require admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotic treatment. HSCT is an alternative treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with WAS, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when perfectly-matched cell donors are not available. Approximately 75% of WAS patients treated with HSCT experience serious complications, such as severe infections requiring hospitalization, autoimmune manifestations, and graft versus host disease within the first year of receiving the treatment. The risk of HSCT-related complications is greater in certain patients, including those that have had a previous splenectomy or are over five years old.
 Our solution, OTL-103 for treatment of WAS 
 We are developing OTL-103 as an ex vivo autologous lentiviral vector-mediated HSC gene therapy to treat patients with WAS through a single administration. OTL-103 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s peripheral blood or bone marrow that are modified to add a functional WASP gene using a lentiviral vector. The autologous gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a conditioning regimen that is similar to that used in an allogeneic HSCT. 
 17


We obtained worldwide rights to this program through the GSK Agreement. The CTA was transferred to us in August 2018. 
 As of January 2020, eight patients have been treated with OTL-103 in an ongoing registrational trial and nine patients in an expanded access program, with a maximum follow-up of up to approximately 9 years post-treatment.  In addition, a clinical trial using the proposed commercial cryopreserved formulation of OTL-103 was initiated in 2019 and has recruited six subjects five of whom have been treated with a maximum follow up of approximately 8 months.
 OTL-103 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of WAS. OTL-103 has also received a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. An IND for OTL-103 was opened in 2019 and regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation was granted. We plan to submit an MAA with the EMA and a BLA with the FDA for OTL-103 for the treatment of WAS in 2021. 
 Registrational trial 
 Our anticipated MAA and BLA submissions for OTL-103 will include data from eight currently enrolled patients treated with a fresh product formulation in a registrational trial at San Raffaele Hospital for which follow-up is ongoing. The primary analysis for this registrational trial is prospectively defined to be when all patients have completed three years’ follow-up. The eighth and final patient in this trial reached three years’ follow-up in late September 2018. Manufacture of the fresh OTL-103 drug product formulation (with bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source) was performed by a third-party commercial CDMO. Data from the registrational trial will be supported by nine patients dosed in an expanded access program. Based on discussions with the FDA and EMA, we intend to submit data for additional patients treated with the commercial cryopreserved formulation. 
 Patients treated in the registrational trial and compassionate use program had a diagnosis of WAS and were ineligible for HSCT treatment due to the absence of an HLA-matched sibling or family member to serve as an allogenic bone marrow donor. Patients in the study using the cryopreserved formulation also had a diagnosis of WAS and were eligible if no HLA-matched related donor was available.
 The primary goals of the registrational clinical trial are to assess the efficacy and safety of OTL-103 in WAS patients, as measured by, for example, improved T-cell function, improved platelet count and overall survival at 36 months. Secondary goals of this clinical trial include reduced bleeding episodes and reduced frequency of severe infections. 
 The results of an interim analysis of this clinical trial were published in 2019 in Lancet Haematology and showed that WASP expression in lymphocytes and platelets was substantially improved compared to baseline by six months and remain constant thereafter. At one-year post-treatment with OTL-103, T-cell counts increased in all seven evaluable patients, as compared to counts prior to treatment, reaching normal values. Because of the increase in T-cells, a reduction in infections was observed in patients post-treatment compared to one year prior to treatment with OTL-103. 
 Mean platelet counts before treatment were low, with a range of 6–25 x 109 per liter observed in all eight patients. Platelet counts progressively improved in all patients. One-year post-treatment platelet counts increased in all patients to a range of 21–74 x 109 per liter, and further increases in platelet count were observed in six patients to a range of 27–169 x 109 per liter at three years post-treatment. In addition to the increase in platelet count, increased and sustained platelet volume in seven patients was also observed at three years post-treatment. These increases in platelet count and volume resulted in reduced frequency and severity of bleeding events as compared to those experienced by these patients prior to treatment with OTL-103.
 In patients with at least one year of follow-up (n=14), the absence of severe bleeding events and independence from platelet transfusions were observed in all subjects by 9 months of follow-up. Additionally, a reduction in severe infection rate was observed post-treatment.
 18


As of January 2020, the date of the most recent safety report available to us, 100% overall survival has been observed in the eight patients treated in the registrational clinical trial, with a maximum follow-up of up to 9.6 years and a median follow-up of 7.5 years. Safety data from the eight patients treated in the registrational clinical trial indicate OTL-103 was well-tolerated, with no instances of insertional mutagenesis. There were 29 treatment emergent SAEs reported within the trial, none of which were assessed by the investigator as being related to OTL-103. Eight treatment emergent SAEs were reported in six patients in the expanded access program none of which were assessed by the investigator as being related to OTL-103. One patient in the expanded access program died as a consequence of a deterioration in a pre-existing neurological condition. That event was deemed to be unrelated to the product by the investigator. Four treatment emergent SAEs were reported in three patients treated in the Cryo clinical trial using the proposed commercial cryopreserved formulation of OTL-103, and none were assessed by the investigator as being related to OTL-103. Across the program, the most common SAEs were pyrexia and infections. There were no OTL-103 related SAEs leading to the withdrawal of patients from the trial. Because follow-up is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigator of any SUSAR. 
 Regulatory pathway for OTL-103 
 In July 2019 the FDA granted RMAT designation for the development of OTL-103. An initial comprehensive multidisciplinary type B meeting with the FDA is expected for early 2020. RMAT designation includes all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with FDA. RMAT programs are intended to facilitate development and review of regenerative medicine therapies that address an unmet medical need in patients with serious conditions. However, RMAT designation is not the same as an approval and does not change the statutory standards for marketing approval. If the FDA determines that later in development of OTL-103 the product no longer meets the qualifying criteria, then the FDA may rescind the RMAT designation.
 We are currently in discussions with EMA and FDA to finalize the requirements for our planned MAA and BLA submissions, respectively, for OTL-103 in 2021. We currently expect that our MAA and BLA submissions will include clinical data from a registrational trial of 8 patients treated with a fresh product formulation at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, as well as 9 additional patients treated with a fresh product formulation under an expanded access program, and supportive data derived from patients treated at the same clinical site with a cryopreserved formulation. Prior to our BLA and MAA submissions for OTL-103, we will be required to complete a clinical trial report for our registrational trial (with all patients with at least three years follow-up), as well as for our supportive clinical trial with cryopreserved formulation to support analytical comparability between fresh and cryopreserved drug product formulations. 
 We intend to seek approval of OTL-103 using mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source. The registration trial included five patients treated with bone marrow as cellular source, two patients with mobilized peripheral blood, and one patient with both. Since then, all patients were treated with mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—“We may be unable to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability between drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product.”
 19


We expect to have additional meetings with EMA and FDA, including a pre-MAA and a pre-BLA meeting, to obtain their concurrence on the appropriate data to support our marketing authorization application. Although we currently expect to complete our MAA and BLA submissions by 2021, our discussions with EMA and FDA are ongoing, and we do not yet have definitive feedback from the EMA and FDA on the scope or adequacy of the requisite data necessary to justify an approval.
 Gene therapy for treatment of X-CGD 
 Disease overview 
 X-CGD is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease of the immune system. X-CGD is an X-linked-recessive disease and therefore affects males. Because of the underlying genetic defect in the cytochrome B-245 beta chain, or CYBB, gene in patients with X-CGD, the patient’s white blood cells, specifically neutrophils/granulocytes, are unable to kill bacteria and fungi, leading to repeated chronic infections. The main clinical manifestations of X-CGD are pyoderma; pneumonia; colitis; lymphadenitis; brain, lung and liver abscesses; and osteomyelitis. Granuloma formation can also occur as a result of persistent inflammatory response to the pathogens and can result in recurrent obstructions of the gastro-intestinal and urinary tract. Patients with X-CGD typically start to develop infections in the first decade of life. Mortality in X-CGD has been estimated at approximately 40% by the age of 35 years. 
 The incidence of X-CGD is currently estimated to be between 2.6 and 10 in 1 million male live births. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Current treatment options for X-CGD include prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal medications and interferon-gamma, which are not always effective in preventing severe infections. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with X-CGD, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when well-matched cell donors are not available. 
 Our solution, OTL-102 for treatment of X-CGD 
 We are developing OTL-102 as an ex vivo lentiviral vector-mediated autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with X-CGD through a single administration. OTL-102 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow, then modified to add a functional CYBB gene using a lentiviral vector. The gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. 
 OTL-102 is currently being investigated in ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials in the United States and in Europe and has evidenced sustained CYBB expression for over two years in six patients to date, with a follow-up of up to three years post-treatment in three patients. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to the OTL-102 program through an option and license agreement with Généthon, pursuant to which we have exercised an option to certain intellectual property and clinical data associated with clinical trials at sites in the United States and the United Kingdom.
 OTL-102 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA and FDA for the treatment of X-CGD. 
 Ongoing clinical trials
 OTL-102 is currently being investigated in two ongoing investigator-sponsored proof of concept clinical trials in the United States and in Europe, with target enrollment of 10 patients in a clinical trial sponsored by UCLA in the United States and target enrollment of five patients in a clinical trial conducted by GOSH in Europe. The clinical trial sites include Boston Children’s Hospital, the NIH, and UCLA in the United States, and GOSH and The Royal Free Hospital in London. Manufacture of the drug product occurred at each of these sites using the same vector. As of July 2019, nine patients have been treated in the clinical trial in the United States, five of which were treated with a fresh product formulation and four of which were treated with a cryopreserved formulation. Further, three patients have been treated in the clinical trial in Europe, one of which was treated with a fresh product formulation and two of which were treated with a cryopreserved product formulation. One patient has been treated in a compassionate use program in Europe with a cryopreserved product formulation. In the future, we expect to treat additional patients in this trial with a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-102. Patients enrolled in these trials have advanced and severe stages of X-CGD. 
 20


The primary goals of these clinical trials are to assess safety and efficacy, as measured by biochemical and functional reconstitution through increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase, or NADPH oxidase, activity in progeny of engrafted cells and stability at 12 months post-treatment. 
 In these clinical trials, the production of NADPH-oxidase activity in neutrophils, a biomarker that demonstrates restored granulocyte function, has been measured in patients for up to 24 months post-treatment. In a recent publication in Nature Medicine, combined data from nine patients, including initial enrollees in both clinical trials and a compassionate use patient, showed NADPH-oxidase activity, as measured by dihydrorhodamine, or DHR, assay, above 10% in six patients with at least 24 months follow-up. Based on the investigator’s review of the scientific literature, they determined that 10% was a clinically meaningful percentage for fighting infections successfully. One pediatric patient showed initial engraftment of DHR+ cells followed by a decrease to levels of 1% or less. The graphic below illustrates sustained NADPH-oxidase levels, as measured for up to 24 months post-treatment. Since September 2018, four additional patients have been treated as part of the clinical trials, with one adult patient having sustained DHR+ neutrophils of 77.2% at 6 months and three pediatric patients displaying a similar response to the pediatric patient that did not respond to therapy. These observations specific to the pediatric patients are under investigation, and investigators are planning to enroll additional pediatric patients in 2020 to assess outcomes in this patient population.
 OTL-102 (X-CGD): oxidase activity(1)

(1) Excludes data from one patient treated with drug product deemed by the investigator to be a different form of OTL-102 drug product.
 As of December 2019, the date of the most recent safety data available to us, safety data from the U.S. patients treated in this clinical trial indicate OTL-102 was generally well-tolerated, with no instances of insertional mutagenesis up to forty-eight months post-treatment. There were eighteen SAEs reported, none of which were assessed by the investigator as being possibly related to drug product. There were no AEs or SAEs leading to the withdrawal of patients from the trial. All AEs and SAEs resolved with standard of care treatment. 
 Because follow-up in this clinical trial is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigator in this clinical trial of any SUSAR. In the U.K. study, eight SAEs were reported, one of which was deemed as possibly related to the product. The patient that suffered from this SAE experienced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome at initial engraftment of functional neutrophils, manifesting as pericardial effusion and abdominal pain, which resolved with steroid cover. This event is still under investigation by the data safety monitoring board. 
 21


Two patients treated with OTL-102 as part of the clinical trials died during the three months period following treatment as a result of pre-existing disease-related complications present at the time of treatment with OTL-102. One of these patients (from the U.K. trial) died of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This subject had a pre-existing lung condition. The other patient (from the U.S. trial) developed platelet antibodies due to sensitization after several granulocytes infusions the patient received prior to gene therapy. As a result, following gene therapy he was unable to respond to platelet transfusion and died from hemorrhage. Following this event, in September 2017, the investigators put this trial on hold, and after discussions with the FDA and the data safety monitoring board, the trial was re-initiated in February 2018. The learnings from this patient resulted in a protocol amendment to prevent patients with existing platelet antibodies from enrolling in the trial. Neither of these two fatalities was deemed by the investigator to be related to the therapy. A third fatality was reported involving a patient treated under the compassionate use program at GOSH. Because of this patient’s advanced disease stage at the time of enrollment, the patient required a surgical procedure following treatment and died as a result of complications from this procedure. This fatality was deemed by the investigator not to be related to the product. It should be noted that this patient’s data have been excluded from the data set in the clinical trials because the patient was treated with drug product manufactured under a different manufacturing process than that used for OTL-102, which was deemed by the investigator to be a different drug product than OTL-102. 
 Gene therapy for treatment of TDT 
 Disease overview 
 Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by one of over 200 mutations in the hemoglobin beta, or HBB, gene. Patients with beta-thalassemia have low levels of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. TDT is the most severe form of beta-thalassemia and requires patients to receive eight or more blood transfusions per year, with the number of transfusions dependent upon the severity of the patient’s disease. Symptoms in TDT patients appear within the first two years of life and include failure to thrive, persistent infections and life-threatening anemia. Patients with TDT also suffer from other symptoms such as liver and spleen enlargement, bone deformities and osteopenia, and hypermetabolic state, resulting in chronic malnourishment. Patients often need a multidisciplinary team of cardiologist, hepatologist, endocrinologist, orthopedic, and psychologist support. In the absence of regular blood transfusions, TDT is usually fatal in infancy. 
 TDT is one of the most common genetic diseases, with a global incidence estimated at approximately 25,000 symptomatic individuals born each year. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 The symptoms experienced by most patients with TDT are severe and often require frequent, life-long blood transfusions to replenish the patient’s hemoglobin level. Because iron cannot be excreted by the body, these frequent blood transfusions can cause iron to accumulate in various organs, leading to risk of heart or liver failure. Therefore, patients who receive ongoing blood transfusions must also receive iron chelation therapy to remove the excess iron. These medicines also have side effects and can negatively impact a patient’s quality of life. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with TDT, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when perfectly matched cell donors are not available. 
 Our solution, OTL-300 for treatment of TDT 
 We are developing OTL-300 as an ex vivo lentiviral vector-mediated autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with TDT through a single administration. OTL-300 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own mobilized peripheral blood, then modified to add a functional HBB gene using a lentiviral vector. The gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intra-osseous administration following treatment with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. We plan to investigate treatment through an intravenous administration of OTL-300 as part of the clinical development of this product candidate. OTL-300 is designed to significantly reduce or eliminate the need for blood transfusions in patients with TDT. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to this program through the GSK Agreement. OTL-300 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of beta-thalassemia major and intermedia. In addition, OTL-300 has received Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the EMA.
 Proof of concept trial (cryopreserved formulation) 
 OTL-300 has been investigated in an academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to establish proof of concept. The study and clinical follow-up completed in November 2019, and reporting is underway.  Nine patients with severe TDT received a single intra-osseous infusion of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-300 and were followed up for 2 years. The patients evaluated in this trial included six pediatric patients aged three to 17 years, and three 
 22


adult patients aged 18 years and over. On completion of the study, all patients enrolled in an Orchard-sponsored long-term follow-up clinical trial, which will continue assessment for an additional six-year period. 
 The primary goals of the clinical trials were to assess the safety and efficacy of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-300 in TDT patients, as measured by, for example, reduction in required blood transfusions to manage the patients’ TDT and overall survival at 24 months post-treatment. 
 As of November 2019, all patients had completed at least 21 months of post-treatment follow-up. Transfusion independence or significant reductions in transfusion frequency and volume requirements were observed in six patients, with four of the six pediatric patients being transfusion-free since approximately one-month post-treatment (follow-up ranging from 21-39 months). Following treatment, substantial reductions (in excess of 50%) in transfusion volume requirements were observed over a period of at least 3 years in two out of three adult patients, one of whom had a 9-month transfusion-free period during the first-year post-treatment.
 As of April 2019, the date of the most recent development safety update report, 100% overall survival has been observed, with follow-up ranging from 16 to 43 months. Safety data from the nine patients treated to date indicate that OTL-300 was generally well-tolerated, with no instances of insertional mutagenesis. There were five SAEs reported, none of which were assessed by the investigator as being related to OTL-300. The SAEs included central line and mycobacterium infection, febrile neutropenia, gastroenteritis, and obstructive pancreatitis due to gall stones. There were no AEs or SAEs leading to the withdrawal of patients from the trial. All SAEs resolved with standard of care treatment. Because follow-up in this clinical trial is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not been notified by the investigator in this clinical trial of any SUSAR. 
 Gene therapy for treatment of MPS-I 
 Disease overview 
 Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA. Inherited deficiency of IDUA is responsible for MPS-I. The disease is characterized by inappropriate storage of glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, with accompanying organ enlargement, the excretion of abnormal quantities of GAGs in urine, and disrupted GAG turnover that especially affects connective tissues and the nervous system. Without treatment, clinical manifestations of this severe disease include skeletal abnormalities with severe orthopedic manifestations, hepatosplenomegaly, neurodevelopmental decline, sight and hearing disturbances, cardiovascular and respiratory problems leading to death in early childhood. IDUA deficiency can result in a wide range of clinical severity, with 3 major recognized clinical entities: Hurler, or MPS IH, Scheie, or MPS IS, and Hurler-Scheie, or MPS IH/S, syndromes. Hurler and Scheie syndromes represent phenotypes at the severe and attenuated ends of the MPS-I clinical spectrum, respectively, and the Hurler-Scheie syndrome is intermediate in phenotypic expression.
 MPS IH is usually associated to the presence of two nonsense mutations resulting in the complete absence of residual enzyme activity. MPS IH is characterized by a chronic, progressive and disabling disease course involving multiple organs and tissues. The median age of diagnosis for MPS IH is 12 months; most affected children are diagnosed before 18 months of age. Infants affected by MPS IH usually appear normal at birth, but may develop inguinal or umbilical hernias in the first six months, and develop the characteristic somatic phenotype over the first few years of life. 
 The approximate incidence of MPS-I is of 1 in 100,000 live births.
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Because of its potential to compensate the deficiency, ERT – parenteral administration of purified recombinant pro-enzyme – has become the most promising therapeutic option for some LSDs, including for some forms of MPS-I. However, systemic administration of ERT only partially addresses the systemic manifestations of the disease, particularly orthopedic and skeletal  symptoms. In addition, the blood-brain barrier severely limits access of systemically administered therapeutic molecules to the nervous tissue, greatly reducing the therapeutic impact of this strategy. Thus, ERT is not currently recommended as a unique treatment option for MPS IH patients, except for the preparatory phases of allogeneic transplantation.
 HSCT has been provided to more than 500 MPS IH patients with the goal of providing a stable endogenous source of functional IDUA enzyme. Although HSCT has been shown to be clinically effective, increasing life expectancy and 
 23


improving various clinical outcomes, the impact of HSCT on the central nervous system, or CNS, and skeletal disease has been shown to be suboptimal, likely due to insufficient metabolic correction by the IDUA enzyme at these disease sites.
 Our solution, OTL-203 for treatment of MPS-I 
 Ex vivo lentiviral vector mediated autologous HSC gene therapy strategies aimed at correcting the genetic defect in patients’ HSCs could represent a significant improvement for the treatment of MPS IH when compared to conventional allogeneic HSCT. Autologous cells may be genetically modified to constitutively express supra-normal levels of the therapeutic enzyme and become a quantitatively more effective source of functional enzyme than wild-type cells, possibly also at the level of the nervous system and bone. The therapeutic potential of this strategy for addressing the extensive nervous system manifestations of MPS IH is based on the contribution of HSCs to the turnover of CNS-resident microglia, demonstrated both in physiological and pathological conditions. Since microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including LSDs, these cells should be considered a primary target cell type in therapeutic strategies for LSD with neurologic involvement such as MPS IH. Moreover, compared to allogeneic transplantation, the autologous procedure is associated to a significantly reduced transplant-related morbidity and mortality and avoids the risks of graft versus host disease.
 Ongoing clinical trials
 OTL-203 is currently being investigated in an ongoing, academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to establish proof of concept. The study is a prospective, monocentric, therapeutic-exploratory, single dose, proof of concept, non-randomized, open label study involving a single injection of autologous HSCs genetically modified with a lentiviral vector. The target enrollment in this trial is eight patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS IH, and all eight patients have now been enrolled and received a single dose of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-203. The patients evaluated in this trial include pediatric patients aged ≥ 28 days and ≤ 11 years old and will be followed for at least 2 years post-treatment in the context of the proof of concept study and then continue to be evaluated in a long-term follow-up study.
 The primary endpoints of the trial are safety, haematological engraftment by day 45 following treatment and preliminary efficacy as measured by IDUA enzyme activity (up to supraphysiologic levels) at one-year post-treatment. 
 Preliminary data from the proof of concept study with OTL-203 has demonstrated:
  
• | OTL-203, the mobilising protocol and the selected conditioning regime were well-tolerated
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid hematologic reconstitution, with neutrophil and platelet engraftment within three weeks following treatment
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engraftment in the bone marrow and periphery by assessment of the vector copy number
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supranormal IDUA enzyme expression in peripheral blood
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Key secondary and exploratory endpoints include normalization of urinary GAGs, growth velocity and effects on motor and cognitive function at one- and two-years post-treatment.
 For the first six treated patients, with up to 12 months of follow-up in one patient and a median follow-up of 6 months, restoration of IDUA enzyme activity in the periphery to supranormal levels and reduction of GAG levels in the urine was observed.  Furthermore, restoration of IDUA activity in cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, and reduction of GAG levels in CSF was observed in four patients, with up to 12 months of follow-up in one patient and a median follow-up of 6 months. 
 For the patient with 12 months of follow-up, preliminary clinical evaluation showed signs of resumed growth, improved motor skills and a stable cognitive score.
 We expect to release interim data for this trial in 2020, with 12-month follow-up results for the first eight patients, including the primary endpoints, anticipated in 2021. 
 OTL-203 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of MPS-I. 
 Our gene therapy programs for the treatment of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB 
 Disease overview 
 24


MPS-IIIA (also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A) and MPS-IIIB (also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B) are life-threatening metabolic diseases that cause accumulation of glycosaminoglycan in cells, tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. Within one to two years after birth, MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB patients begin to experience progressive neurodevelopmental decline, including speech delay and eventual loss of language, behavioral disturbances, and potentially severe dementia. Ultimately, most patients with MPS-IIIA progress to a vegetative state. Life expectancy for patients with MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB is between 10 to 25 years and 15 to 30 years, respectively. 
 The incidence of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB are currently estimated to be one in 100,000 and one in 200,000 live births per year, respectively. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Currently, there are no effective treatments or approved therapies for MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. Systemic ERT is not an approved treatment option and HSCT is not considered to be an effective treatment option for these diseases. The severity of symptoms and lack of an effective treatment option to manage these symptoms is a significant burden to MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB patients, their caregivers and families and healthcare systems. 
 Our solutions, OTL-201 for treatment of MPS-IIIA and OTL-202 for treatment of MPS-IIIB
We are developing OTL-201 and OTL-202 as ex vivo lentiviral vector-mediated autologous HSC gene therapies for treatment of patients with MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB, respectively. In both indications we believe preclinical studies in mice have shown that ex vivo autologous gene therapy has the potential to address the neurological manifestations of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB. We have obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to OTL-201 and OTL-202 from The University of Manchester. 
 OTL-201 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA and FDA for the treatment of MPS-IIIA and has received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA. 
 Proof of concept trial in MPS-IIIA
 We are supporting a proof of concept trial for the treatment of MPS-IIIA, which started enrollment in January 2020. The trial is expected to enroll up to five patients in 2020 and is being conducted by the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and sponsored by the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. In early 2019, a child with MPS-IIIA was treated by Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital outside of the clinical trial, though utilizing the same technology and procedures, under a “Specials” license granted by the UK government for the use of an unlicensed pharmaceutical product in situations of high unmet need when there is no other treatment option available.
 Preclinical development of MPS-IIIB 
 In a mouse model of MPS-IIIA, engraftment of donor HSCs modified with the selected vector for this program (a hCD11b-coSGSH lentiviral vector) was observed. Sustained gene expression of the gene-modified HSCs was seen over a follow-up period of approximately six months, which we believe supports the stability of the engraftment of modified cells. 
 Transplantation of gene-modified HSCs resulted in a 4.72-fold increase in enzyme activity relative to wild type enzyme levels and significantly elevated brain enzyme activity. Increased enzyme activity resulted in decreased heparan sulphate substrate accumulation in the brain and correction of behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperactivity and a reduced sense of danger, to normal levels. 
 25


The figures below illustrate the increased enzyme expression observed in the brain, the corresponding decreased substrate accumulation in the brain, and the resulting behavioral correction in a mouse model of MPS-IIIA. 

Preclinical studies in a mouse model of MPS-IIIB have demonstrated correction of neurological activity, as measured by reduction in hyperactivity. Lentivirus vector optimization for OTL-202 for treatment of MPS-IIIB is ongoing, and we plan to continue to progress preclinical development of MPS-IIIB.
 Preclinical data for our gene therapy programs 
 Each of our aforementioned lead programs has been evaluated in preclinical studies of murine models of the target indications. Preclinical development plans have been discussed with or reviewed by the FDA and EMA or European Union Member State Authorities over the course of drug development interactions or approval of clinical trials. 
 Future applications of our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach 
 We believe that our versatile ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach has the potential to deliver promising gene therapies to patients across a broad range of rare diseases. Although our initial focus is on delivering our commercial and clinical-stage gene therapies to patients suffering from ADA-SCID, MLD, WAS, X-CGD, MPS-I, MPS-IIIA, and TDT, we believe we can leverage our significant research and development experience and partnerships with academic institutions to identify other diseases in our target franchise areas, including primary immune deficiencies, neurometabolic disorders and blood disorders, where ex vivo gene therapy has a comparably high probability of success. 
 Our regulatory strategy 
 Due to the nature of our gene therapy product candidates and the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare or ultra-rare indications, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration without having to conduct one or more Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers or Phase 3 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials. Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for the treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following one or more clinical trials in a limited patient population, following review of the trial’s design, endpoints and clinical data by the applicable regulatory agencies. These determinations are based on the applicable regulatory agency’s scientific judgement and these determinations may differ in the United States and the European Union. 
 We refer to an exploratory study, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as a proof of concept trial, and a confirmatory efficacy and safety study to support submission of a potential marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial, as a registrational trial. In some cases applicable regulatory agency may require us to perform analytical studies or conduct additional clinical trials to support analytical comparability of drug product, for example by demonstrating comparability of drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability of drug product that has been cryopreserved and 
 26


fresh drug product. For purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these clinical trials as supportive clinical trials. In addition, certain of our product candidates may be evaluated in clinical trials for which clinical data is not intended to be pooled with data from our registrational trials for purposes of a regulatory submission, but will be submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies for informational purposes. For purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these trials as additional clinical trials. In addition, in some cases patients may be ineligible for participation in our clinical trials and may receive treatment under a compassionate use program or an expanded access program. We expect that the available safety and efficacy results from all these trials would be included in any regulatory submission we may submit and the applicable regulatory agency with respect to each clinical program the applicable regulatory agency will make a determination as to whether the available data is sufficient to support a regulatory submission. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—“The results from our clinical trials for OTL-101 for ADA-SCID, OTL-200 for MLD, OTL-103 for WAS and for any of our other product candidates may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission or granting of marketing approval for our product candidates,” “We may be unable to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from the patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability between drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product,” and “To date, most of the clinical trials for our product candidates were conducted as investigator sponsored clinical trials using drug product manufactured at the academic sites.” 
 Manufacturing 
 The diseases we are targeting affect patients across the world. Therefore, we are implementing our plans to build a commercial-scale manufacturing infrastructure and leverage technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally. 
 Global supply network with experienced CDMOs 
 We currently partner with a network of experienced CDMOs, including Oxford BioMedica and MolMed S.p.A., for the supply of our vectors and/or drug product. We have established relationships with commercial CDMO partners with the resources and capacity to meet our clinical and existing and expected initial commercial needs. Two of our vector CDMOs currently manufacture for approved commercial gene therapy products. Our CDMO partners also provide us with access to their state-of-the art manufacturing technologies. 
 Manufacturing efficiencies and scalability 
 We are investing in infrastructure, technologies and human capital to build manufacturing capabilities for HSC based autologous ex vivo gene therapy. We currently operate one process development laboratory facility in Menlo Park, California. We are in the process of building an integrated facility in Fremont, California designed to accommodate our needs to grow our process development capabilities and establish in-house manufacturing to ensure reliable supply of vector and drug products for clinical and commercial use. We have on-going effort to enhance our product and process understanding while actively exploring and developing innovative technologies for vector and drug product manufacturing to improve the efficiency and scalability of the processes with an ultimate goal to produce high quality products for global rare disease patients at lower cost. We continue to invest in our people to support the commercialization and lifecycle management of our pipeline products. We believe our strategy could enable the industrialization of the scientific breakthroughs in gene therapy research to bring potential cures to the rare disease patients worldwide. 
 Cryopreservation of our gene therapy programs 
 Cryopreservation of the gene-modified cells is a key component of our strategy to deliver potentially transformative gene therapies to patients worldwide. We have developed cryopreserved formulations of our OTL-101, OTL-102, OTL-103, programs and expect to demonstrate comparability of our cryopreserved formulations to earlier manufactured fresh formulations in support of future submissions for marketing approval in the United States and Europe. Our programs in OTL-102, OTL-300, OTL-203 and OTL-201 have already started or will start with cryopreserved formulations. We plan to establish cryopreserved product formulations as the standard for all of our future gene therapy candidates. 
 In the cryopreservation process, a patient’s gene-modified HSCs are frozen at extremely low temperatures and then stored to allow quality control testing and release to be performed before introducing the gene-modified cells back into the patient. Our cryopreserved formulations are expected to have shelf-lives of months to years, enabling us to potentially distribute our products and product candidates from a few centralized manufacturing facilities to geographically dispersed treatment sites. Our ability to ultimately distribute our product candidates globally will facilitate access of the therapies to patients and reduces the logistical burden on the patients and their families. 
 27


Commercial operations
 Subject to approval from the EMA of OTL-200 for the treatment of MLD, which is anticipated in the second half of 2020, we expect to launch OTL-200 in Europe. As we plan to support the potential launch of OTL-200, we have started to build commercial operations in Europe and the United States with a goal of delivering OTL-200 to patients through qualified treatment centers. We have begun a phased build of commercial capabilities by adding employees with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. We expect to continue expansion of these capabilities throughout 2020 and beyond as we continue to implement appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure in order to support our complex supply chain, qualify and train treatment centers, establish patient-focused programs, educate healthcare professionals, and secure reimbursement. The timing and conduct of these commercial activities will be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. As part of the commercialization process, we are engaged in discussions with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including public and private payors, patient advocates and organizations, and healthcare providers, to drive more timely patient identification through education, newborn screening, and diagnostic initiatives and to explore new payment models that we hope will enable broader patient access. Ultimately, we intend to utilize the commercial infrastructure that we build to support the potential for multiple product launches, if approved, sequentially across multiple geographies. For many territories and countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract field-based teams to assist in the commercialization of our products.
 Intellectual property and barriers to entry 
 Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect commercially important and proprietary aspects of our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets, and operate without infringing misappropriating and otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. In particular, we strive to protect the proprietary aspects of our business and to develop barriers to entry that we believe are important to the development and commercialization of our gene therapies. For example, where appropriate, we develop, or acquire exclusive rights to, clinical data for each of our products/product candidates, patents, know-how and trade secrets associated with each of our products/product candidates. However, we do not own any patents or patent applications that cover Strimvelis or any of our lead product candidates. We in-license from UCLB and UCLA one family of patent applications directed at OTL-101. We cannot guarantee that patents will issue from any of these patent applications or from any patent applications we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we guarantee that any patents that may issue in the future from such patent applications will be commercially useful in protecting our products/product candidates. In addition, we plan to rely on regulatory protection based on orphan drug exclusivities, data exclusivities and market exclusivities. See “—Government regulation” for additional information. 
 We currently rely primarily on know-how and trade secret protection for aspects of our proprietary technologies that we or our licensors believe are not amenable to or appropriate for patent protection, including, for example, clinical data and production information for Strimvelis and each of our product candidates. However, know-how and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar know-how, trade secrets or proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to such know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information or such know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection or that they may not be breached and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
 In addition, with regard to patent protection, the scope of coverage being sought in a patent application may be reduced significantly before a patent is issued, and even after issuance the scope of coverage may be challenged. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 With regards to our OTL-101 product candidate, we have exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable, licenses pursuant to the UCLB/UCLA Agreement to clinical data and to a patent family containing one pending U.S. patent application with composition of matter claims directed to the OTL-101 product candidate and its use in the treatment of ADA-SCID, and one pending counterpart European patent application. The U.S. patent application, if issued as a U.S. patent, would be expected to expire in 2036, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account. In addition, under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, we have non-exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable, licenses to know-how and materials relating to the OTL-101 product candidate. 
 28


With regards to Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200 and OTL-300, and as discussed in detail in “—License agreements”, we have exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable licenses pursuant to the GSK Agreement and the R&D Agreement to anonymized patient-level data arising from the clinical trials of Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200 and OTL-300 and know-how, including other clinical data and production information relating to Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200, and OTL-300. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we are seeking patent protection for our product candidates, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which provides additional term caused by administrative delays at the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened it a patent is terminally disclaimer over another patent with an earlier expiration date. 
 Furthermore, in the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if we obtain an issued U.S. patent covering one of our present or future product candidates, and if such product candidate receives FDA approval, we expect to apply for a patent term extension, if available, to extend the term of the patent covering such approved product candidate. We also expect to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such an extension should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such an extension. 
 License agreements 
 GSK asset purchase and license agreement 
 In April 2018, we entered into the GSK Agreement pursuant to which GSK transferred to us its portfolio of approved and investigational rare disease gene therapies, including Strimvelis, the first gene therapy approved by the EMA for ADA-SCID, two late-stage clinical gene therapy programs in ongoing registrational trials, OTL-200 for MLD and OTL-103 for WAS; and OTL-300, a clinical-stage gene therapy program for TDT. In addition, GSK novated to us their R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR. 
 Under the GSK Agreement, we are subject to certain obligations to develop and advance certain of the acquired product candidates. For example, we are required to first use best endeavors to file an MAA for OTL-200 for MLD in either Europe or a BLA for MLD in the United States and to subsequently use commercially reasonable efforts to file an MAA or BLA, as applicable, in the other jurisdiction and to market, sell and promote OTL-200 in such jurisdictions. We are also required to use best endeavors to file a BLA for OTL-103 for WAS in the United States and to use commercially reasonable efforts to file an MAA for OTL-103 in Europe, and to subsequently market, sell and promote OTL-103 in such jurisdictions. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and file an MAA or BLA, as applicable, for OTL-300 for TDT in either the United States or Europe. In addition, we must also use best endeavors to maintain the MAA and regulatory designations for Strimvelis in the European Union and to continue to make Strimvelis available to eligible patients until an alternative gene therapy product has received marketing approval in Europe. We must also continue to make Strimvelis available at the San Raffaele Hospital for as long as a minimum number of patients are treated and entitled to receive reimbursement for the provision of Strimvelis, over a defined period. We intend to continue to make Strimvelis available for so long as we are required to do so under the GSK Agreement. 
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a PRV from the FDA for each of Strimvelis, OTL-200, OTL-103 and OTL-300 and to transfer the first such PRV to GSK. GSK also has an option to acquire at a defined price any PRVs granted to us thereafter for Strimvelis, OTL-200, OTL-103 and OTL-300. In the event that GSK does not exercise this option with respect to any PRV, we may sell the PRV to a third party and must share any proceeds in excess of a specified sale price equally with GSK. 
 GSK received a one-time upfront fee of £10.0 million under the GSK Agreement, and we issued to GSK 12,455,252 of our Series B-2 convertible preferred shares and we recorded a payable due to GSK of £4.9 million, of which £2.5 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2019.  The Series B-2 convertible preferred shares were converted to ordinary shares as part of our initial public offering.
 29


Under the GSK Agreement we are also obligated to pay non-refundable royalties and milestone payments in relation to the gene therapy programs acquired and OTL-101. We will pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on the combined annual net sales of ADA-SCID products, which includes Strimvelis and our product candidate, OTL-101. We will also pay tiered royalty rates at percentages from the mid-teens to the low twenties for the MLD and WAS products, upon marketing approval, calculated as percentages of aggregate cumulative net sales of the MLD and WAS products, respectively. We will pay a tiered royalty at percentages from the high single-digits to the low teens for the TDT product, upon marketing approval, calculated as percentages of aggregate annual net sales of the TDT product. These royalties owed to GSK are in addition to any royalties owed to other third parties under various license agreements for the GSK programs. In aggregate, we may pay up to £90.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain sales milestones. Our royalty obligations with respect to MLD and WAS may be deferred for a certain period in the interest of prioritizing available capital to develop each product. Our royalty obligations are subject to reduction on a product-by-product basis in the event of market control by biosimilars and will expire in April 2048. 
 We may terminate our development and/or commercialization activities of any of the programs under the GSK Agreement, upon the occurrence of an SAE, or if we believe such program poses a safety risk to patients. GSK may require us to grant a third party a non-exclusive license under the intellectual property we have acquired from GSK under the GSK Agreement if we materially breach of our obligations to use best endeavors and/or commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the acquired programs and fail to develop and implement a mutually agreeable plan to cure such material breach within a specified time period. The foregoing license only continues until such time as we cure our material breach and we must pay GSK all amounts we receive from the third party in connection with such license. 
 Telethon-OSR research and development collaboration and license agreement 
 In April 2018, in connection with our entering into the GSK Agreement, we entered into a deed of novation with GSK, Telethon Foundation and San Raffaele Hospital, together referred to as Telethon-OSR, pursuant to which we acquired and assumed all of GSK’s rights and obligations under the R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR for the research, development and commercialization of ex vivo HSC gene therapies for ADA-SCID, WAS, MLD, TDT, and options on three additional earlier-stage development programs.
 Pursuant to the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR had granted to GSK an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID. In addition, Telethon-OSR had granted to GSK an exclusive option for an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize certain vectors and gene therapy products from disease-specific development programs for the treatment of WAS, MLD, TDT, as well as three additional earlier-stage development programs. Our options under the R&D Agreement with respect to the three earlier-stage programs have lapsed. At the time we entered into the deed of novation agreement, GSK had completed development, launched and commercialized Strimvelis for ADA-SCID in the European Union, and had exercised its exclusive option to obtain exclusive licenses from Telethon-OSR to the WAS, MLD and TDT programs. We acquired Strimvelis and GSK’s exclusive licenses relating to the ADA-SCID, WAS, MLD and TDT collaboration programs pursuant to the GSK Agreement and to the deed of novation. 
 Under the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct each of the collaboration programs in accordance with development plans approved by a joint steering committee. With respect to those programs in relation to which our option has been exercised, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval, launch and promote in both the European Union and the United States all licensed products and to commercialize and manufacture such products at levels sufficient to meet commercial demands. We are required to use best efforts to renew the European Union marketing authorization for Strimvelis to enable patients to be treated at the San Raffaele hospital from all referring centers globally, as permitted by applicable law. With certain exceptions, Telethon-OSR is responsible for all costs and activities associated with the collaboration programs prior to our exercise of the option for any such program. We are responsible for the costs and activities associated with the continued development of Strimvelis and each program for which an option under the R&D Agreement is exercised. 
 As consideration for the licenses and options granted under the R&D Agreement, we are required to make payments to Telethon-OSR upon achievement of certain product development milestones. We are also required to pay Telethon-OSR a fee in connection with the exercise of our option for each collaboration program. We are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of €31.0 million in connection with product development milestones with respect to those programs for which we have exercised an option under this agreement (that is, our WAS, MLD and TDT programs). Additionally, we are required to pay to Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on net annual sales of licensed products on a country-by-country basis, as well as a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income received from any certain third party sublicensees of the collaboration programs. Our royalty obligation expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patent rights in such country, the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, and the expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity in such country, provided that our royalty obligation will terminate immediately in the event significant generic or biosimilar competition to a licensed product achieves a certain threshold percentage of the market share. 
 30


Unless terminated earlier, the R&D Agreement will expire (i) on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to such product in such country, (ii) in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to the last product in all countries in the world and (iii), on a program-by-program basis when no vector or gene therapy product is being researched, developed or commercialized. Either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time. Additionally, either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate involvement in a collaboration program for compelling safety reasons, and either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement if the other party becomes insolvent. We may also terminate the R&D Agreement either in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis for any reason upon notice to Telethon-OSR. 
 UCLB/UCLA license agreement 
 In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, with UCLB and UCLA, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license to certain technology, clinical data, manufacturing know-how, and intellectual property rights related to the production of virally transduced HSCs for treatment of patients with ADA-SCID, in addition to certain other rare disease indications. We must use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize a gene therapy product in each of the foregoing indications in the United States, United Kingdom and at least one of France, Germany, Italy and Spain as soon as reasonably possible. 
 UCLB received an aggregate upfront fee of £1.4 million and a patent reimbursement fee of £12,524 under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, and we issued to UCLB 1,224,094, and 3,441,290 of our ordinary shares in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are also required to make certain annual administration payments to UCLB upon our receipt of VAT invoices. 
 Under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, we are also obligated to pay UCL royalties ranging from low to mid-single-digit percentages on net sales of each of the product candidates subject to the UCLB/UCLA Agreement that receive marketing approval. Our royalty obligations under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement terminate in February 2041. In addition, we are required to pay to UCLB milestone payments up to an aggregate of £28.9 million ($37.9 million as of December 31, 2019) upon achievement of our first, second and third marketing approvals of product candidates under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the UCLB/UCLA Agreement will expire in February 2041. We may terminate the UCLB/UCLA Agreement in its entirety or with respect to either UCLB or UCLA for any reason upon prior written notice. Additionally, either we or UCLB may terminate the UCLB/UCLA Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time, or if the other party becomes insolvent. 
 Oxford BioMedica license and development agreement 
 In November 2016, we entered into a license and development agreement, or the Oxford Development Agreement, with Oxford BioMedica (UK) Limited, or Oxford BioMedica, for the development of gene therapies for ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and certain other diseases that we may request be included under the Oxford Development Agreement, such other diseases referred to as Subsequent Indications. The Oxford Development Agreement was amended in June 2017, May 2018, July 2018 and September 2018. 
 Pursuant to the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development and commercialization of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications, except that such license is non-exclusive to the extent the treatment of a Subsequent Indication is the subject of a certain previous license granted by Oxford BioMedica. Oxford BioMedica also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development, commercialization and manufacture of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of certain diseases other than ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications. Under the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities set forth in a collaboration plan approved by a joint steering committee, and we are responsible for certain costs of the activities set forth in such collaboration plan. 
 As consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 588,220 of our ordinary shares to Oxford BioMedica. We are also obligated to issue additional equity upon the achievement of certain milestones, pursuant to which we issued 150,826 ordinary shares upon the achievement of the first milestone in November 2017 and 150,826 ordinary shares were issued upon the achievement of further milestones in August 2018. Additionally, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products until January 31, 2039. The foregoing royalties are reduced by a mid-double digit percentage in the case of compassionate use of a licensed product in a country until the first commercial sale following marketing authorization in such country. We are also required to pay a set monthly fee to Oxford BioMedica in the event we use a certain Oxford BioMedica system for generating stable cell lines. 
 31


Unless terminated earlier, the Oxford Development Agreement will expire when no further payments are due to Oxford BioMedica. We may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan upon notice to Oxford BioMedica, and either party may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan or the Oxford Development Agreement if the other party commits a material breach that is not cured within a certain period of time. Either party may also terminate the Oxford Development Agreement in the event the other party becomes insolvent. 
 Telethon-OSR license agreement
 In May 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Telethon-OSR under which Telethon-OSR granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of ex vivo autologous HSC lentiviral based gene therapy products for the treatment of MPS-I, including MPS IH. Under the terms of the agreement, Telethon-OSR is entitled to receive an upfront payment, and we may be required to make milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Additionally, we will be required to pay Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on annual net sales of licensed products.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our portfolio of product candidates and scientific expertise in gene therapy provides us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. 
 We face competition not only from gene therapy companies, but also from companies that are developing novel, non-gene therapy approaches or improving existing treatment approaches. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved. 
 We are currently aware of the following competitive approaches: 
  
• | ADA-SCID: The current standards of care for the treatment of ADA-SCID are HSCT and chronic ERT. In October 2018, the FDA approved elapegademase-lvlr (tradename Revcovi), a PEGylated recombinant ADA ERT marketed by Leadiant Biosciences to treat ADA-SCID.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MLD: To our knowledge, there is currently no effective treatment option for patients with MLD. HSCT has demonstrated limited efficacy in arresting disease progression and is therefore not considered a standard of care for this disease. A number of alternative approaches to HSCT are under investigation. We are aware that the Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale and Bicêtre hospital in Paris are investigating intracerebral gene therapy for MLD. We are also aware that Takeda is investigating ERT for MLD with a biweekly intrathecal infusion. We are also aware that Shenzhen University is evaluating a lentiviral ex vivo gene therapy for MLD.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WAS: The current standard of care for WAS is HSCT. Patients who are unable to match with a blood donor or who are otherwise ineligible for HSCT may pursue palliative care options, including intravenous immunoglobulin and antimicrobials to prevent and treat infections, topical corticosteroids to manage outbreaks of eczema, platelet transfusions to treat severe bleeds, and immunosuppressive drugs, such as rituximab (tradename Rituxan), to counter autoimmune manifestations. Splenectomy may also be used to treat thrombocytopenia. These palliative approaches do not slow disease progression or address the underlying cause of WAS. We are also aware that Généthon and Boston Children’s Hospital are sponsoring clinical trials with ex vivo autologous lentiviral gene therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | X-CGD: Management options for patients with X-CGD include prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal medications and interferon-gamma therapy. HSCT is also a treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. We are aware that Généthon is sponsoring a clinical trial in France for X-CGD with an ex vivo autologous lentiviral gene therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MPS-I: The current standard of care for the treatment of MPS-1 involves regular intravenous injections of laronidase (tradename Aldurazyme), an ERT commercialized by BioMarin and Sanofi Genzyme. A formulation of laronidase for intrathecal administration is currently under evaluation. HSCT is also a treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. We are aware that RegenX Bio is developing RGX-111, an AAV-based gene therapy, and that ArmaGen is developing AGT-181, an ERT. Additionally, Sangamo Therapeutics has a program using zinc-finger nucleases to insert a functional copy the IDUA gene into liver cells, and Magenta Therapeutics is conducting clinical trials to evaluate MGTA-456, an agent to expand cord-blood for use in HSCT to treat MPS-I.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32


 
• | MPS-IIIA: There are currently no effective disease modifying treatment options for patients with MPS-IIIA. We are aware of three gene therapy candidates in clinical development. Lysogene is developing SAF-302 in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics, an AAV10 gene therapy product administered through intracerebral injections, Abeona Therapeutics is developing ABO-120, an AAV9 gene therapy product administered intravenously, and Esteve is developing EGT-101, an AAV9 gene therapy administered through intracerebroventricular injection. Currently no companies are developing ERTs for MPS-IIIA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TDT: The current standard of care for the treatment of TDT involves chronic blood transfusions to address anemia combined with iron chelation therapy to manage the iron overload often associated with such chronic blood transfusions. HSCT is also a treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. TDT is a highly competitive research area with one approved treatment option and several novel approaches under investigation. In June 2019 the EMA approved LentiGlobin (under the trade name Zynteglo) an ex vivo autologous gene therapy marketed by bluebird bio for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and over with less severe (non-β0/β0 genotype) TDT and without an HLA-matched donor. bluebird bio has publicly announced its intention to file a BLA in the United States for LentiGlobin in 2020, as well as label expansions in other TDT genotypes. In addition, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex are conducting a study of gene editing cell therapy in patients with TDT, and Sangamo is also conducting a study with a gene editing approach to treat TDT. Luspatercept-aamt (tradename Reblozyl), which is being jointly developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Acceleron Pharma, was approved in the United States in November 2019 for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. Several other non-gene therapy approaches are under investigation to improve treatment outcomes in beta-thalassemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors. 
 Government regulation 
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product must be reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state legislatures, agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard, could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 33


U.S. biological products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, unless justified, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or CGTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 34


Following commencement of a clinical trial, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval or licensing. In particular, such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The FDA must be able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary by the FDA. 
 An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. 
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the NIH, Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closed October 16, 2018, the NIH announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. In April 2019, NIH announced the updated guidelines, which reflect these proposed changes, and clarified that these trials will remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Further, NIH renamed the RAC the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee, or NExTRAC, and revised its role to provide recommendations to the NIH Director and a public forum for the discussion of the scientific, safety, and ethical issues associated with emerging biotechnologies. 
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 35


 
• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors of human gene therapy products integrating vectors such as gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors and transposon elements observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 
 Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following a single clinical trial in a limited patient population, sometimes referred to as a Phase 1/2 trial, but which may be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial following review of the trial’s design and primary endpoints by the applicable regulatory agencies. Determination of the requirements to be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial is subject to the applicable regulatory authority’s scientific judgement and these requirements may differ in the U.S. and the European Union. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 36


Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a ‘‘filing’’ decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the continued safety, purity and potency of such product. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the CGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the CGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through appropriate screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, CGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 37


If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product for the same use or indication, and we are unable to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior to the previously approved drug for the same use or indication. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 
 Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. 
 38


Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 RMAT designation 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of RMAT, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. RMAT do not include those HCT/Ps regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 39


Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biological product is granted four- and 12-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.

Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 
 Government regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Regulation in the European Union 
 In the European Union, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products, which are cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation and that are administered to human beings in order to regenerate, repair or replace a human tissue. We anticipate that our gene therapy development products would be regulated as ATMPs in the European Union. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application during the eight year period. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may therefore not qualify for data exclusivity. Products with an orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time “no similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union where an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 41


The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made; or (2) ) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union  and that without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
  
• | The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Pediatric development 
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 
 Post-approval controls 
 The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 42


All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which European Union pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the United Kingdom. This transition period is due to end on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable:
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;

• | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;

 Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 We may also be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states. 
 Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. In addition, our gene therapy program, Strimvelis, was approved by the EMA in 2016, and the approval and commercialization of Strimvelis subjects us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. The approval and commercialization of any of our other gene therapies outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. 
 The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain a robust system to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial cost. 
 Healthcare reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual, nondeductible fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the PHS Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program, also known as the 340B Drug Pricing Program; created new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; created a new requirement to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors of record provide to physicians; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.

Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. The loss of the cost share reduction payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. This was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments on December 10, 2019.
 Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA -mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to legislation amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 and 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019.  While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any gene therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any gene therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payors. Payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers generally rely on these third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a payor not to cover our gene therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.

Additionally, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive clinical trials in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
