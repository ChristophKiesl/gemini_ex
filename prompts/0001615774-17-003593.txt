Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Ipsidy Inc. (formerly known as ID Global Solutions Corporation) together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we” or “our”), is a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity management and electronic transaction processing services. In a world that is increasingly digital and mobile, our vision is to enable solutions that provide pre-transaction verification of identity as well as embed identity verification within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform, or other electronic systems.
 
We are building upon our existing capabilities in biometric identification and multi-factor identity management solutions to develop an identity transaction platform for our business customers. The platform is being designed to enable the end users of our business customers to more easily authenticate their identity to a mobile phone or portable device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware). The existing system enables participants to complete transactions with a digitally signed authentication response, including the underlying transaction data and embedded attributes of the participant’s identity. 
 
We believe that it is essential that businesses and consumers know who is on the other side of an electronic transaction and have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the other party was duly verified. We are therefore developing solutions intended to provide our customers with the next level of transaction security, control and certainty. Our platform is being developed to use biometric and multi-factor identity management solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions. We define “electronic transactions” in the broadest sense to include not only financial transactions (i.e. exchanges of value in all of their forms), and legal transactions (e.g. approving the release of personal or other confidential data or the execution of documents), but also access control to physical environments (for example border crossings and secure areas at offices, data centres and other sensitive locations) and digital environments (e.g. accessing account information, voting systems, email systems and controlling data network log-ins).

In addition, we believe that with the massive increase in transactions originated by devices as a result of the growth of the Internet of Things (IOT) that businesses and consumers alike will ultimately need more control over these device-originated electronic transactions, which we intend to support with our platform.
 
The Company’s products currently focus on the broad requirement for identity, access and transaction verification and associated identity management needs and the requirement for cost-effective and secure mobile electronic payment solutions for institutions and their customers. We aim to offer our customers solutions that can be integrated into each customer’s business operations in order to facilitate their use and enhance the end user customer experience. 
 
Our digital mobile wallet application, or electronic account holder is currently in development. This electronic account holder will be used to contain different services and accounts that can be easily added and enable users to conveniently and securely effect a variety of electronic transactions, using their identity. One example is our closed-loop payment account, digital issuance platform, currently in user acceptance testing, that is intended to offer secure and cost-effective methods of conversion of cash and paper to electronic payments. Once it is implemented, consumers accessing this system, using their mobile phones, electronic devices, or smart card payment tokens will be able to participate in the digital economy thereby facilitating financial inclusion for the un-banked and under banked population around the globe. Another example is for consumers and employees to use their mobile application to verify identity, in order to access secure digital, or physical environments. 
 
Management believes that some of the advantages of the Company’s platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets including the identity management and transaction processing sectors and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products requiring low cost, secure, and configurable mobile solutions. These vertical markets include but are not limited to border security, public safety, public transportation, enterprise security, payment transactions and banking. The Company’s recent launch of unattended kiosks supporting the loading of value for electronic ticketing for public transportation in Colombia, is a further example of the innovative solutions that the Company can offer. The Company believes that the various technologies that the Company is developing and has acquired can be combined into a unified offering. At its core, this offering is intended to facilitate the processing of diverse electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or physical or digital access, all of which can include identity management, verification and identity transaction recording.
 
The Company’s solutions for fingerprint based identity management and electronic payment transaction processing are in the market today. However, we are still in the process of integrating the technologies, which we have developed internally with those we have acquired and thereby creating combined solutions intended to better service our target markets. The Company continues to invest in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to complete the platform, which is intended to allow us to achieve our goals. In order to achieve this integration and development, the Company will need to raise additional capital. 
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 21, 2011 and changed its name to Ipsidy Inc. on February 1, 2017, and our common stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol “IDGS”. Our corporate headquarters is located at 780 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach, NY 11561 and our main phone number is (407) 951-8640. We maintain a website at www.ipsidy.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
Global Market Opportunity
 
We believe that there are several market trends that drive growth in the identity management and electronic transaction processing marketplace, including growing concerns over identity theft and fraud and the increase in electronic payments, in particular solutions provided by non-bank entities. Moreover the individual’s increasing reliance on devices of their choosing most often a mobile phone, or portable computing device poses challenges for both software and hardware providers to incorporate these technologies into their offerings.
 
While an increasingly digital world drives convenience, it also drives an increasing risk of compromised passwords, security breaches and stolen identities.  With every online purchase, e-bill payment and download of new travel, dining and gaming ‘apps’ to a mobile smartphone, consumers’ digital identity expands.  In 2014, the US e-commerce marketplace suffered over $4 billion in fraud affecting card-not-present payment transactions and this figure is projected to more than double by 2020. (Source: The Nilson Report).  To combat fraud and to better confirm customers’ identities, we see an increasing deployment of biometric solutions in the marketplace. In their 2015 report, Goode Intelligence forecast that by 2020 over 1.1 billion financial services customers will be using mobile biometrics to access and secure their accounts, and more than 16 billion mobile biometric payment transactions will be made.

IHS Markit, forecasts in their report on Internet of Things, or IOT that the number of devices connected to the IOT, will increase from an installed base of 15.4 billion devices in 2015 to 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and 70.4 billion devices in 2025 (Source IHS Markit “IoT Platforms: Enabling the Internet of Things” March 2016). According to the report, one of the major challenges facing the growth of IOT is data security and privacy and IOT platform solutions will need to have authentication identity management and other security, as a key component of the platform.
 
The Company intends to develop products which will provide identification verification in the processing of automated electronic transactions from Internet connected devices, in order to ensure that the owner of the device has certainty as to the recipient of the data and the transaction. In addition, the owner will be able to control the transaction and approve, or decline the completion of the requested event.
 
Despite heightened awareness of digital security resulting from the recent FBI and Apple iPhone legal battle, access to digital services and thus our identities is still secured in the majority of cases only through a simple username and password, although more services are introducing two factor authentication.  In the United States, the most common and powerful “password” to confirm identity is still the social security number, which recent hacks of Government databases have shown is very vulnerable to being stolen.  Governments, institutions and enterprises have therefore become concerned to find more secure ways to verify identity and manage the identities of the persons with whom they need to interact, be they employees, customers, authorized users or citizens.
 
Businesses spend significant capital on acquiring and deploying dedicated equipment to fulfill a variety of their business requirements. The ubiquitous availability and use of mobile devices, which consumers have become accustomed to using for a wide variety of functions, creates the opportunity to dispense with dedicated equipment in favor of an easily downloadable “app” for a mobile device. We intend to develop solutions for our business customers in order to take advantage of this global trend. For example, the replacement of traditional point of sale payment card terminals with payment by means of the customer’s mobile device. Another example would be access to a locked door by identification to the user’s phone, or access to e-mail multi-factor authentication to the user’s phone instead of a hardware token. 
 
Electronic payments of all forms have continued to grow at a healthy rate. According to the World Payments Report 2016, published by Capgemini and BNP Paribas, global non-cash transaction volumes increased by 7.8% in 2013, while in Latin America the increase was 8.7% and in Central Europe, Middle East and Africa the rate was 10.6%. More significantly, the report highlighted the importance of what it describes as the “hidden payments” market, namely payments undertaken by means of closed loop cards and mobile apps, digital wallets offered by non-banks, mobile money offered by non-banks and virtual currencies. The authors estimate that these payment methods represented anywhere up to 10.5% of the electronic payments market in 2013 and they expect this sector to grow.
 
The key drivers for these alternative payment methods are consumer demands for convenient and faster payment transactions. The gaps in the existing value propositions offered by the banks mainly because of legacy systems and regulatory constraints, which can stifle innovation and the inability of many consumers to access the banks’ traditional payment services.  In a growing electronic payments market, these alternative payment methods are therefore perceived by the industry as an important route for both innovation and financial inclusion.

Growth Strategy 
 
With the acquisitions of MultiPay (2015) and FIN (2016), the Company has acquired not only innovative technology, but existing products, revenues and a customer base upon which the Company can build. We seek to extend our position and execute our business plan by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative security and payment services to our customers that help them achieve their operational or business goals. The execution of our strategy is subject to our obtaining sufficient additional working capital to finance the various initiatives discussed, whether through investment or otherwise. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.
 
Focus on existing customer base
 
To ensure its current products and solutions are properly positioned in the market, the Company has established dedicated sales and marketing teams in the United States, Colombia and South Africa. These teams are focused on supporting the already existing indirect distribution channels in their respective regions.
 
Cross sell to existing customers
 
The Company is examining opportunities to offer its new platform capabilities and solutions to existing customers. For example, we believe that the opportunity exists to offer the closed loop payment solution to passengers using our transit kiosk services, who could utilize their electronic transit cards for purchases and bill payments. Tokenization of transactions is also a secure processing methodology that has numerous applications across different customer use cases. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create a platform that combines our identity management technology with our payment processing capabilities, and thereby, have a more complete offering for customers that are ultimately using only one of those services.
 
Add new customers
 
The Company plans to grow its core business through focused sales and marketing of its current products and solutions, as well as its newly developed platforms and solutions. The sales and marketing teams referenced above are also tasked with developing additional distribution channels and seeking out new customers.

Enter new markets
 
By virtue of the recent acquisitions the Company has already entered new markets in Colombia and South Africa. The Company believes that the solutions that are currently being offered and developed in those countries will be suitable to be similarly offered in other emerging markets in the Latin American and African regions. Furthermore, the improvements to the Company’s platforms and the expansion of the sales teams are being undertaken with a view to being able to support transaction processing and customers across borders without the need to establish and build new facilities in each new country, thereby reducing the costs of entry into each new market. There are no current plans to expand into new countries at this time.
 
Innovation
 
As the electronic and cybersecurity industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We also believe it will be critical to our growth for us to continue to enhance our platform capabilities. We believe the development of new services and solutions will be an important revenue source in the future, and enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities. For example, a key offering recently launched is our unattended kiosk solution. Today we offer a low operating cost alternative for transportation providers to accept money and provide electronic ticketing for their services. The Company believes that our out-of-band authentication technology can be combined with unattended kiosks to offer similar low operating cost solutions for account enrollment in a variety of business verticals, without the need for physical presence. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that address some of today’s major global market challenges and opportunities arising in identity management and access control, coupled with the ubiquitous use of mobile devices. By combining our core technologies we aim to build an identity transaction platform using biometric and multi-factor identity management solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions.
Select Acquisitions
 
As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Strategic Partners and Suppliers
 
The Company believes that strategic partnerships will be a major component of the Company’s operating strategy and path to success. The Company intends to work with several strategic partners in important areas of its business and operations. Currently, the Company has several strategic partners (noted below) and plans to foster additional such relationships. 
 
In 2014, the Company established a business relationship with a kiosk manufacturer, Slabb Inc., for the production of a Multi-modal Biometric Enrolment and Verification Kiosks as well as for un-attended Transit Ticketing Kiosks. The Company purchased the first final production Multi-Modal Biometric Kiosk from this manufacturer in May 2014 and received delivery of the unit in June 2014. In addition, the Company has purchased un-attended Transit Ticketing kiosks from this manufacturer and 78 kiosks are now in service in Colombia. In February 2017, the Company and Slabb, Inc. entered into an agreement for the production of additional un-attended Transit Ticketing Kiosks and the related maintenance and support services required under the contract for the Bogota Transit Authority.
 
Sales and Distribution Agreements
 
The Company has established business relationships with sales agents, distribution partners and others to promote and sell the Company’s products. The Company has sales and distribution agreements with companies in Colombia, South Africa and the United States.Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has conducted limited advertising and marketing to date. The Company has, however, given substantial attention to constructing the marketing strategy and plans that it will use in order to grow its business and expand its customers. The Company anticipates that it will eventually need a significant budget for marketing activities. The primary focus of marketing campaigns will be designed to help the Company find new customers and to increase awareness of the Company’s products and platform.
 
The Company expects that its sales team will work closely with the marketing team to convert prospects into new customers. The sales team will be structured to align with target markets based on territory.

Revenue Model
 
Identity Solutions and Products
 
The biometric fingerprint solutions are priced based on an annual licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system. The Company expects to provide its new platform service for identity management transactions based on a subscription model, based on tiered fees per enrolled user, card or device. The Company’s CardPlus plastic and credentials card products will be sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product.  The biometric fingerprint solutions product has been commercialized and has generated revenue in 2016. CardPlus did not produce revenues until 2016, in conjunction with the FIN acquisition described previously.
Payment Processing Solutions and Products
 
The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction basis. The pricing for the Company’s new closed loop financial payment platform is expected to be based on a combination of transaction fee and percent of transaction value model. MultiPay currently uses this technology and has generated revenue during 2016 and 2015. The Company also earns leasing income from the rental of unattended kiosks.
Competition
 
The identification management and payment processing industries are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. The Company will need to consistently develop and improve products in order to remain competitive in the technology industry.
 
Several competitors exist for the Company’s current and planned products and platform services relating to the identity management and electronic payment transaction markets. The competitive landscape includes several companies that address one or the other area, with some addressing both areas independently.
 
To further analyze the competitive landscape, the identity management market must be segmented into out-of band authentication and biometric identification & verification solution providers. Major competitors offering solutions in both areas include, Safran Identity & Security, Gemalto, HID Global and SuperCom. Major competitors offering only out-of band authentication, include Twillio/Authy, Google, Datacard, Symantec, Duo, RSA and ID.ME. Companies offering only biometric identification & verification include NEC, Imageware, Aware, Veridium and Daon. There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems, such as SuperCom.
 
The Ipsidy identity management transaction platform is being developed based on a patent-pending methodology, which integrates digital signature authentication and vetted biometric identity verification delivered through an out-of-band transaction. The Company anticipates that when completed this could provide functionality for users to have real-time control over their electronic transactions through a mobile application, with a detailed audit trail created for each transaction, containing the digitally signed transaction details and biometric identity. This patent-pending approach of combining transaction details and identity into a single, digitally signed message could allow the Ipsidy platform to be a complimentary solution to a many of its competitors and hence differentiate itself in the market. More specifically, the platform is designed to be able to leverage third party biometric identification and verification solutions, thereby creating the opportunity to partner with companies already offering those capabilities.
 
        The Cards Plus business faces competition both locally in South Africa and internationally. China has become a source of imports of card products at highly competitive pricing and some local suppliers are reliant on Chinese card manufacturers Local competitors include Card Technology Services, Easy Card and Open Gate, Cardz Group and XH Smart Technology (Africa). That said, we believe that we are the only significant manufacturer in South Africa using digital print technology.
 
The payment processing industry has many competitors who provide gateway services, closed loop end-to-end solutions, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. As these types of services are usually supplied by regional or country specific companies, the following is a breakdown of this competitive landscape, specifically in those countries or regions the Company is actively pursuing business in today. In Colombia, major competitors include PayU, Nequi, Daviplata and QPagos.
 
 While the Company will take steps to protect and maintain its intellectual property and competitive designs, there is no guarantee that such steps can safeguard against the rapid technological changes and innovation in industries in which we operate.

In addition, it is possible that other technology companies could develop competing technology and products. Many of our competitors are much larger organizations that typically have larger sales, marketing and R&D budgets, more financial, technical customer support and other resources, greater brand recognition and the ability to hire talented personnel to more quickly develop and commercialize new products. There are no assurances the Company will ever be able to compete in its target markets.
 
Acquisitions
 
On April 6, 2015, the Company closed on a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with all of the shareholders (the “MultiPay Shareholders”) of MultiPay S.A., a Colombian corporation (“MultiPay”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MultiPay (the “MultiPay Shares”) from the MultiPay Shareholders on a fully diluted basis. In consideration for the MultiPay Shares, the Company agreed to issue and sell to the MultiPay Shareholders an aggregate of 7,600,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company issued approximately 6,100,000 shares of common stock to the MultiPay Shareholders upon closing of the transaction. Upon the MultiPay Shareholders paying certain liabilities in the approximate amount of US $370,000, the Company was required to deliver the balance of approximately 1,500,000 shares of common stock to the MultiPay Shareholders. The MultiPay Shareholders paid approximately $60,000 and the Company issued an additional approximately 260,000 shares. The remaining shares were not issued. Multipay, through the use of its own proprietary software platforms is engaged in providing an array of value added payment gateway services as well as complimentary mobile wallet applications and services to various customers in Colombia and Peru. MultiPay was established in December of 2008 and as of May 31, 2017 has 38 full time employees (including related Colombian operations) based in Bogota, Colombia.
 
On February 8, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of FIN Holdings Inc. (“FIN”), a related party via common management and partial common ownership, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, ID Solutions Inc., a Delaware Corporation specializing in field proven, cutting-edge biometric fingerprint software technology and algorithms, as well as Cards Plus Pty Ltd, a South African company which provides unique secure credential products and solutions utilized by governments in Africa. The purchase price of $9,000,000, was paid through the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the FIN shareholders. The acquisition enhances the Company’s current Transaction Security and Financial Inclusion platforms with highly accurate, fully integrated biometric fingerprint verification and backend matching capabilities. Recently tested by the U.S. Government National Institute of Standards, ID Solutions’ proprietary fingerprint technology performed in certain cases ahead of other leading fingerprint biometric companies from around the world. This biometric technology has also been successfully utilized by the U.S. government as a back office AFIS (automated fingerprint identification system) solution that is used to ensure the identity of transportation workers throughout the country, as well as in U.S. commercial markets and by other governments worldwide in order to verify identity and secure physical and digital access. With the addition of the CardsPlus portfolio of physical cards and card personalization solutions, the Company can provide government and commercial customers with a complete solution for their identity programs and financial payment systems. As of May 31, 2017, FIN and its subsidiaries had 28 full time employees based in suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.
 
 Intellectual Property
 
The Company licenses certain technology for use in its products and business. The Company has purchased a license of the new payment transaction platform, with the right to acquire the source code.
 
The Company also holds numerous patents and intellectual property as a result of an assignment of the same to the Company in November 2012 by certain shareholders of the Company.  Each of these individual assignors now beneficially own shares of common stock in the Company (as a result of the IIM Acquisition, since these individuals were formerly shareholders of Innovation in Motion). Additionally, the Company acquired intellectual property in its recent acquisitions as discussed previously and we expect the capitalized intellectual property balance to increase as we invest and develop new product offerings. The Company has $2.4 million of capitalized Intellectual Property, the breakdown of which can be seen in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
The following is a summary of the patents and patent applications as well as the trademarks that the Company has filed throughout the world:
