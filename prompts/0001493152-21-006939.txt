Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
We were formed to design, manufacture, and distribute innovative tools and accessories to the building industry. We market and distribute various home improvement and construction product lines for both Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) and professional markets under the TOUGHBUILT® brand name, within the global multibillion-dollar per year tool market. All of our products are designed by our in-house design team. Since our initial launch of product sales seven years ago, we have experienced annual sales growth from approximately $1,000,000 in 2013 to approximately $39,000,000 in 2020.
 
Since August 2013, pursuant to a Service Agreement, we have been collaborating with Belegal, a Chinese firm (“Belegal”), whose team of experts has provided ToughBuilt with additional engineering, sourcing services, and quality control support for our operations in China. Belegal assists us with supply chain management (process and operations in China) for our operations in China, among other things, facilitating the transmission of our purchase orders to our suppliers in China, conducting “in-process” quality checking and inspection, and shipping end-products manufactured in China to their final destinations. In accordance with the Services Agreement, we pay all of the monthly costs for payroll, overhead, and other operating expenses associated with the Belegal’s activities on behalf of ToughBuilt.
 
Our business is currently based on development of innovative and state-of-the-art products, primarily in tools and hardware category, with particular focus on building and construction industry with the ultimate goal of making life easier and more productive for contractors and workers alike. Our current product line includes two major categories related to this field, with several additional categories in various stages of development, consisting of soft goods and Kneepads and Sawhorses and Work Products.
 
ToughBuilt designs and manages its product life cycles through a controlled and structured process. We involve customers and industry experts from our target markets in the definition and refinement of our product development. Product development emphasis is placed on meeting and exceeding industry standards and product specifications, ease of integration, ease of use, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, quality, and reliability.
 
Our mission consists, of providing products to the building and home improvement communities that are innovative, of superior quality derived in part from enlightened creativity for our end users while enhancing performance, improving well-being, and building high brand loyalty.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 9, 2012, as Phalanx Inc. We changed our name to ToughBuilt Industries, Inc. on December 29, 2015.

Products
 
We create innovative products that help our customers build faster, build stronger, and work smarter. We accomplish this by listening to what our customers want and need and researching how professionals work, then we create tools that help them save time, save hassle and save money.
 
TOUGHBUILT® manufactures and distributes an array of high-quality and rugged tool belts, tool bags, and other personal tool organizer products. We also manufacture and distribute a complete line of knee pads for various construction applications. Our line of job site tools and material support products consists of a full line of miter saw and table saw stands and saw horses/job site tables and roller stands. All of our products are designed and engineered in the United States and manufactured in China and India under our quality control supervision. We do not need government approval for any of our products.
 
Our soft-sided tool storage line is designed for a wide range of Do-It-Yourself and professional needs. This line of pouches and tool and accessories bags is designed to organize our customers’ tools faster and easier. Interchangeable pouches clip on and off any belt, bag ladder wall, or vehicle. Our products let our customers carry what they want so they have it when they want it. ToughBuilt’s wide mouth tool carry-all bags come in sizes from 12 inches to 30 inches. They all have steel-reinforced handles and padded shoulder straps which allow for massive loads to be carried with ease. Rigid plastic hard-body lining protects everything inside. Double mesh pockets included inside provide complete visibility for stored items. They include a lockable zipper for added security and safety and secondary side handles for when it takes more than one to carry the load.
 
All of these products have innovative designs with unique features that provide extra functionality and enhanced user experience. Patented features such as our exclusive “Cliptech” mechanism incorporated in some of the products in this line are unique in these products for the industry and have distinguished the line from other similarly situated products thus we believe, increasing appeal among the other products of this category in the professional community and among the enthusiasts.
 
Soft Goods
 
The flagship of the product line is the soft goods line that consists of over 100 variations of tool pouches, tool rigs, tool belts and accessories, tools bags, totes, variety of storage solutions, and office organizers/bags for laptop/tablet/cellphones, etc. Management believes that the breadth of the line is one of the deepest in the industry and has specialized designs to suit professionals from all sectors of the industry including plumbers, electricians, framers, builders, and more.
 
We have a selection of over 10 models of kneepads, some with revolutionary and patented design features that allow the users to interchange components to suit particular conditions of use. Management believes that these kneepads are among the best performing kneepads in the industry. Our “all terrain” knee pad protection with snapshell technology is part of our interchangeable kneepad system which helps to customize the jobsite needs. They are made with superior quality using multilevel layered construction, heavy-duty webbing, and abrasion-resistant PVC rubber.

Metal Goods
 
Sawhorses and Work Products
 
The second major category consists of Sawhorses and Work Support products with unique designs and robust construction targeted for the most discerning users in the industry. The innovative designs and construction of the more than 15 products in this category have led to the sawhorses becoming among the best sellers of category everywhere they are sold. The newest additions in this category include several stands and work support products that are quickly gaining recognition in the industry and are expected to position themselves in the top tier products in a short time. Our sawhorse line, miter saw, table saw & roller stands are built to very high standards. Our sawhorse/jobsite table is fast to set up, holds 2,400 pounds, has adjustable heights, is made of all-metal construction, and has a compact design. We believe that these lines of products are slowly becoming the standard in the construction industry.
 
All of our products are designed in house to achieve features and benefits for not only the professional construction worker but also for the Do-It-Yourself person.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our product strategy is to develop product lines in a number of categories rather than focus on a single line of goods. We believe that this approach allows for rapid growth, wider brand recognition, and may ultimately result in increased sales and profits within an accelerated time period. We believe that building brand awareness of our current ToughBuilt lines of products will expand our share of the pertinent markets. Our business strategy includes the following key elements:

● | A commitment to technological innovation achieved through consumer insight, creativity, and speed to market; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A broad selection of products in both brand and private labels; 
● | Prompt response; 
● | Superior customer service; and 
● | Value pricing. 

 
We will continue to consider other market opportunities while focusing on our customers’ specific requirements to increase sales.
 
Market
 
According to “Statista & Statistic Brain” the annual revenue in the construction industry (based on firm revenue) was $1.731 trillion for 2016 in the United States. There was approximately $394.6 billion in home improvement sales in the U.S. in 20181. The heavy and civil engineering industry is over $260 billion in sales with tools and hardware alone totaling over $60 billion for that same time period. In 2016, there were approximately 729,000 construction companies in the United States employing more than 7.3 million employees. In addition to the construction market, our products are marketed to the “Do-It-Yourself” and home improvement market place. The home improvement industry has fared much better in the aftermath of the Great Recession than the housing market. The U.S. housing stock of more than 130 million homes requires regular investment merely to offset normal depreciation. And many households that might have traded up to more desirable homes during the downturn decided instead to make improvements to their current homes. Meanwhile, federal and state stimulus programs encouraged homeowners and rental property owners to invest in energy-efficient upgrades that they might otherwise have deferred. Finally, many rental property owners, responding to a surge in demand from households either facing foreclosure or nervous about buying amid the housing market uncertainty, reinvested in their units.
 
As a result, improvement and repair spending held up well compared to residential construction spending. According to “Home Improvement – Still Growing in 2019,” on www.hiri.org, “the HIRI/IHS Markit forecast expects 5.5% growth in the home improvement products market in 2019 after a strong 6.2% in 2018.”
 
Total home improvement product sales were expected to increase 5.5% in 2018 to $420 billion in total sales. The Professional Market was expected to increase 6.0% in 2019 over 2018 and the Consumer Market will see a sales increase of 5.3%.

TOUGHBUILT® products are available worldwide in many major retailers ranging from home improvement and construction products and services stores to major online outlets. Currently, we have placement in Home Depot, Menards, Toolbank (UK), Bunnings (Australia), Princess Auto (Canada), Dong Shin Tool PIA (S. Korea) as well as seeking to grow our sales in global markets such as Western and Central Europe, Eastern Europe, South America, and the Middle East.
 
Retailers by region include:
 

● | United States: Lowe’s, Home Depot, Menards, GM products, Fire Safety, Hartville Hardware, ORR, Pooley, YOW, Wesco, Buzzi, and Western Pacific Building Materials 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Canada: Princess Auto 
● | United Kingdom: Toolbank (distribution throughout the UK and online selling for Europe) 
● | Australia: Kincrome, and Bunnings 
● | New Zealand: Kincrome, and Bunnings 
● | Eastern Europe: VSEInstrumenti.ru 
● | South Korea: Dong Shin Tool PIA Co., Ltd. 

 
We are actively expanding into markets in Mexico and Latin American countries and in the Middle East and South Africa.
 
We are currently in product line reviews and discussions with Home Depot Canada, Do It Best, True Value, and other major retailers both domestically and internationally. A product line review requires the supplier to submit a comprehensive proposal which includes product offerings, prices, competitive market studies, and relevant industry trends, and other information. Management anticipates, within the near term, adding to its customer base up to three major retailers, along with several distributors and private retailers within six sectors and among 56 targeted countries.
 
Innovation and Brand Strength
 
Management believes that the robust capabilities at ToughBuilt eclipse those of many competitors as not every distributor or factory has the ability to quickly identify industry and end-user opportunities and execute quickly to deliver winning product lines consistently. Also, in our view, most distributors and factories do not have a recognizable and reputable brand or the proven ability to reach major retailers globally to position their products and brands. We believe that we are able to take a design from concept to market within a very short period of time.
Product and Services Diversification
 
TOUGHBUILT® is a singular brand with a driven team that is poised to scale into a highly recognized global entity. We aim to grow ToughBuilt with several significant subsidiaries in the next few years to become the hub/platform for professionals, DIY’s (Do-It-Yourselfers), and passionate builders everywhere. Management anticipates that future subsidiaries will focus on licensing, gear, mobile, equipment rentals, and maintenance services.

● | Clamp line 
--+-----------------------
● | Hammer line 
● | Pliers line 
● | Screwdriver line 
● | Tape measure line 
● | Utility knife line 

Mobile Device Products
 
Since 2013, we have been planning, designing, engineering, and sourcing the development of a new line of ToughBuilt mobile devices and accessories to be used in the construction industry and by building enthusiasts. We believe that increasing numbers of companies in the construction industry are requiring their employees to utilize mobile devices not just to communicate with others but to utilize the special apps that will allow the construction workers to do their job better and more efficiently. All of our mobile devices are designed and built in accordance with IP-68 and to a military standard level of durability.
 
Our ruggedized mobile line of products was created to place customized technology and wide varieties of data in the palm of the building professionals and enthusiasts such as contractors, subcontractors, foremen, general laborers, and others. We are designing the devices, accessories, and custom apps to allow the users to plan with confidence, organize faster, find labor and products faster, estimate accurately, purchase wisely, protect themselves, workers, and their business, create and track invoicing faster and easier.

Mobile Device Market
 
Based upon an annual white paper published by the Mobile and Wireless Practice of Venture Development Corporation, we believe that an increasing number of companies are requiring their employees to transact business in the field and/or other non-traditional office environments. Because of this and other factors, the construction industry is accelerating its acceptance of wireless technology. We further believe that the construction industry, like other industries, will be leveraging mobile and wireless solutions to address the need for greater collaboration among a highly mobile and distributed workforce.
 
We believe that mobility is one of the top technology trends that construction companies have been focusing on in 2020 and beyond. Mobile technology continues to have a significant impact on business, specifically with regard to business communication as this technology enhances the ability for colleagues at different locations to easily communicate, enhances customer experience through the improvement of applications and websites available to consumers to do business through their devices “at their fingertips,” and optimizes business operations as there is instant access to business functions at any time and from any location.
 
While the construction industry has widely adopted solutions such as push to talk (PTT) telephony applications, the use of mobile and wireless data applications has been limited. IT solutions in general and mobile and wireless solutions specifically have been adopted at varying degrees within organizations and to support the various phases of construction projects. Currently, the business planning, engineering, and procurement operations have more effectively deployed IT solutions while actual construction operations have fallen behind in IT infrastructure and field automation solutions. The construction and engineering workforce is inherently mobile. However, construction sites have never effectively leveraged (wireless) communications networks to connect these distributed and often remote workers and their assets. Nevertheless, construction project managers require real-time access to a variety of information, including real-time tool inventory management, raw materials deliveries, job costing, time stamping, and general project management information. The challenge, however, is the lack of network access on construction sites resulting in an information bottleneck on the job site. Buoyed by advances in wireless technologies – including coverage, performance, security, and cost of ownership – we believe this is becoming an issue of the past for construction operations.
 
Mobile Apps
 
We intend to include apps on our mobile devices and are developing, with a third-party applications developer, apps which will include, among other things, building codes, permitting, estimating, and job listings. The purposes of the apps that are being developed address:

● | Reducing construction delays. Gathering real-time information at the job site about issues such as tradespeople and contractors present at the site, construction progress, or incidents, can reduce overall project delays. This critical information helps to bring issues to light that might put projects on hold, and keep construction on schedule. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improving communication with owners and project stakeholders. Completing daily reports at the job site on mobile devices and sending automated emails can tighten the communication loop with project stakeholders. When all parties involved in the project have access to the same information at the same time, errors are reduced and issues requiring attention can be addressed faster. 
● | Increasing back office efficiency. By eliminating the use of paper and spreadsheets, construction companies can save hundreds of hours spent on data entry, collating information for reporting, or looking for paperwork that has been lost or filed away. Increasing back office efficiency allows projects to be run leaner and to be completed on time and on budget. 
● | Improving accountability of field staff. Staff travel times, GPS locations and time spent on-site can all be consistently monitored with mobile apps. This improves accountability and reduces labor costs. Costs can be also reduced with mobile timesheets that record clock-in/clock-out time to the minute. 
● | Improving accuracy of project documentation. Using mobile apps to capture information at the job site improves accuracy and reduces issues that arise from illegible handwriting, inconsistent data, and information gaps. Photos, GPS, time stamps, and signatures captured on-site provide an accurate and indisputable audit trail for the project, delivering accountability to clients or evidence in legal disputes.

● | Improving equipment management. Construction companies that use a database-driven mobile solution can maximize the use of equipment through better management and tracking. Real-time information about maintenance schedules, availability, and equipment locations helps to improve inventory planning and use. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Utilizing real-time mobile access to plans and bylaws. With apps that provide two-way access to information, construction companies can file electronic versions of drawings, plans, or bylaws for quick offline access by teams in the field. This improves productivity and reduces the need for re-work. 

Sales Strategy
 
The devices, accessories, and bolt-on digital tools will be sold through relevant home improvement big box stores, direct marketing to construction companies, direct marketing of trade/wholesale outlets and to professional outlets.
Intellectual Property
 
We hold several patents and trademarks of various durations and believe that we hold, have applied for or license all of the patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We utilize trademarks (licensed and owned) on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and our Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our ToughBuilt®, Cliptech®, and Fearless® trademarks to be among our most valuable intangible assets. Trademarks registered both in and outside the U.S. are generally valid for 10 years, depending on the jurisdiction, and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on appropriate application.
 
In 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted two new design patents (U.S. D840,961 S and US D841,635 S) that cover ToughBuilt’s ruggedized mobile devices, which are valid for a period of 15 years. We also have several patents pending with the USPTO and anticipate three or four of them to be granted in the near future.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information relating to our design and processes for our products. Copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate.
 
Domain names are a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including ToughBuilt. Domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property. The recognition and value of the ToughBuilt name, trademark, and domain name are core strengths of the Company.
 
We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and proprietary rights assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors. We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality agreements with our suppliers to protect our intellectual property.
 
Competition
 
The tool equipment and accessories industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete with a significant number of other tool equipment and accessories manufacturers and suppliers to the construction, home improvement, and Do-It-Yourself industry, many of which have the following:

● | Significantly greater financial resources than we have; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | More comprehensive product lines; 
● | Longer-standing relationships with suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers; 
● | Broader distribution capabilities; 
● | Stronger brand recognition and loyalty; and 
● | The ability to invest substantially more in product advertising and sales. 


11
--


Our competitors’ greater capabilities in the above areas enable them to better differentiate their products from ours, gain stronger brand loyalty, withstand periodic downturns in the construction and home improvement equipment and product industries, compete effectively on the basis of price and production, and more quickly develop new products. These competitors include DeWalt, Caterpillar, and Samsung Active.
 
The markets for the Company’s mobile products and services are also highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and other digital electronic devices. The Company’s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software, and peripherals ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.
 
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication and media devices. These industries are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded, and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these industries to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company’s products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These industries are characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Competitors include Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm, among others.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 26, 2021, we have 52 full-time employees, including our four executive officers, and 20 independent contractors and consultants. We engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff. All of our employees, consultants, and contractors that are involved with sensitive and/or proprietary information have signed nondisclosure agreements. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee well-being, health, and safety.
