ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this Annual Report to “Aircastle,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Aircastle Limited and its subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report to “Aircastle Bermuda” refer to Aircastle Holding Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries. Throughout this Annual Report, when we refer to our aircraft, we include aircraft that we have transferred into grantor trusts or similar entities for purposes of financing such assets through securitizations and term financings. These grantor trusts or similar entities are consolidated for purposes of our financial statements. All amounts in this Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
Aircastle acquires, leases, and sells commercial jet aircraft to airlines throughout the world. As of February 28, 2021, we owned and managed on behalf of our joint venture 261 aircraft leased to 75 lessees located in 43 countries. Our aircraft are managed by an experienced team based in the United States, Ireland and Singapore. Our aircraft are subject to net leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational, maintenance and insurance costs. However, in many cases we are obligated to pay a specified portion of maintenance or modification costs. As of February 28, 2021, the net book value of our flight equipment (including flight equipment held for lease and net investment in direct financing and sales-type leases, or “net book value”) was $6.69 compared to $7.79 billion at the end of 2019. Our revenues, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA were $832.3 million, $(333.2) million, and $774.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2021, and were $917.9 million, $156.6 million and $862.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
On March 27, 2020, the Company successfully completed its merger (the “Merger”) and is now controlled by affiliates of Marubeni Corporation and Mizuho Leasing Company, Limited (“Mizuho Leasing”). The Merger has not resulted in any change of the Company’s business strategy, and we believe the Company will benefit by having stable investors with a long-term investment horizon. We also may benefit by being affiliated with Mizuho Leasing, part of the Mizuho Financial Group, one of the largest Japanese financial institutions.
As previously disclosed, on September 30, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously agreed to change the Company’s fiscal year end to the twelve-month period ended the last day in February. This change better aligns the Company’s financial reporting period with the financial reporting cycle of its shareholders, Marubeni Corporation and Mizuho Leasing.
Historically, growth in commercial air traffic has been correlated with world economic activity. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in recent years commercial air traffic growth expanded at a rate 1.3 to 2 times that of global GDP growth. The expansion of air travel has driven the growth in the world aircraft fleet; there are approximately 24,000 commercial mainline passenger and freighter aircraft in the world fleet today. Aircraft leasing companies own approximately 47% of the world’s commercial jet aircraft. Under normal circumstances, we would expect the global fleet to continue expanding at a two to four percent average annual rate.
The COVID-19 crisis has had an unprecedented negative impact on the global economy, and in particular on the aviation sector. As a result of COVID-19, there has been a dramatic slowdown in air traffic, with some markets in near complete shutdown. While there have been some limited improvements in certain markets recently, according to IATA, as of February 2021, air travel was still down to approximately 30% of normal levels and a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels is not expected for several years. IATA estimates this situation will cost the airline industry over $510 billion of lost revenue, a number which may be revised upwards. Substantially all of the world’s airlines are experiencing financial difficulties and liquidity challenges, including many of our customers. According to IATA, total net losses for the airline industry will reach $126 billion in 2020 and $48 billion in 2021. This could affect our lessees’ ability to fulfill their lease payment obligations to us. While we believe long-term demand for air travel will return to historical trends over time, the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 economic shock are material; the extent and duration of those impacts cannot currently be determined.
Airlines have been seeking to preserve liquidity by obtaining support from their respective governments, raising debt and equity, delaying or canceling new aircraft orders, furloughing employees, and requesting concessions from lessors. Some have sought judicial protection. We have agreed to defer lease payments with numerous airline customers, 
which they are obligated to repay over time. As of April 15, 2021, we have agreed to defer $108.4 million in near-term lease payments of which $87.4 million are included in Accounts receivable or Other assets as of February 28, 2021. This represents approximately 17% of Lease rental and Direct financing and sales-type lease revenues for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021. These deferrals have been agreed to with 26 airlines, representing 35% of our customers, for an average deferral of five months of lease rentals. In a number of situations, we have agreed to broader restructurings of contractual terms, for example obtaining term extensions, better security packages or other valuable considerations in exchange for short-term economic concessions.
If air traffic continues to remain depressed over an extended period and if our customers are unable to obtain sufficient funds from private, governmental or other sources, we may need to grant additional deferrals to some of our customers or extend the period of repayment for deferrals we have already made. We may ultimately not be able to collect all the amounts we have deferred.
As of April 15, 2021, seven of our customers are subject to judicial insolvency proceedings or similar protection. We lease 23 aircraft to these customers, which comprise 14% of our net book value of flight equipment (including Flight equipment held for lease and Net investment in leases, or “net book value”) and 12% of our Lease rental and direct financing and sales-type lease revenue as of and for the year ended February 28, 2021. One of these customers is LATAM, our second largest customer, which represents 8% of our net book value of flight equipment and 6% of our Lease rental revenue as of and for the year ended February 28, 2021. Based on historic experience, the judicial process can take up to twelve to eighteen months to be resolved. We are actively engaged in these judicial proceedings to protect our economic interests. However, the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and could result in these customers grounding our aircraft, negotiating reductions in aircraft lease rentals, rejecting their leases or taking other actions that could adversely impact us or the value of our aircraft. As a result of these proceedings, the recognition of lease rental revenue for certain customers may be done on a cash basis of accounting rather than the accrual method depending on the customers’ lease security arrangements.
We believe that our long-standing business strategy of maintaining conservative leverage, limiting long-term financial commitments and focusing our portfolio on more liquid narrow-body aircraft will enable us to manage through the COVID-19 crisis. Our portfolio of primarily mid-life, narrow-body aircraft should remain attractive relative to new technology aircraft due to their lower capital costs in an environment of tight airline margins and low fuel prices.
In addition, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our contractual obligations over the next twelve months and as of April 1, 2021, total liquidity of $2.32 billion includes $1.25 billion of undrawn credit facilities, $609 million of unrestricted cash, $123 million of contracted asset sales and $340 million of projected operating cash flows through April 1, 2022. As of February 28, 2021, we have commitments to acquire 25 aircraft for $825.1 million, excluding manufacturer credits, between 2021-2025.
We also believe our platform and personnel position us to effectively manage through the COVID-19 crisis and will enable us to take advantage of new investment opportunities when they arise. Our Company employs a team of experienced senior professionals with extensive industry and financial experience. Our leadership team members have an average of more than twenty years of relevant industry experience, including managing through prior downturns in the aviation industry, like the 2008 global financial crisis and the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on future growth opportunities in the global aviation industry:
•Diversified Portfolio of Modern Aircraft: We have a portfolio of modern aircraft that is diversified with respect to lessees, geographic markets, lease maturities and aircraft types. As of February 28, 2021, our owned and managed aircraft portfolio consisted of 261 aircraft, of a variety of types leased to 75 lessees located in 43 countries. Lease expirations for our owned aircraft are well dispersed, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 4.2 years. This provides us with a long-dated base of contracted revenues. We believe our focus on portfolio diversification reduces the risks associated with individual lessee defaults and adverse geopolitical or economic issues, and results in generally predictable cash flows.
•Flexible, Disciplined Acquisition Approach and Broad Investment Sourcing Network: Our investment strategy is to seek out the best risk-adjusted return opportunities across the commercial jet market, so our acquisition targets vary with market opportunities. Since our formation, we have acquired 525 aircraft for 
$16.7 billion as of February 28, 2021. We source our acquisitions through well-established relationships with airlines, other aircraft lessors, manufacturers, financial institutions and other aircraft owners. Since our formation in 2004, we built our aircraft portfolio through more than 169 transactions with 95 counterparties as of February 28, 2021.
•Significant Experience in Successfully Selling Aircraft Throughout Their Life Cycle: Our team is adept at managing and executing the sale of aircraft. Since our formation, we have sold 259 aircraft to 80 buyers for $6.1 billion as of February 28, 2021. These sales produced net gains of $417.3 million and involved a wide range of aircraft types and buyers. Of these aircraft, 171, or 66%, were over fourteen years old at the time of sale; often being sold on a part-out disposition basis, where the airframe and engines may be sold to various buyers. We believe our competence in selling older aircraft is one of the capabilities that sets us apart from many of our competitors.
•Strong Capital Raising Track Record and Access to a Wide Range of Financing Sources: Since our inception in late 2004, we raised approximately $1.7 billion in equity capital from private and public investors as of February 28, 2021. We maintain a strong, strategic relationship with Marubeni Corporation (“Marubeni”), which is one of our Controlling Shareholders (as defined below). We also obtained $18.9 billion in debt capital from a variety of sources including the unsecured bond market, commercial banks, export credit agency-backed debt, and the aircraft securitization market. The diversity and global nature of our financing sources demonstrates our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and seize new opportunities.
•Our Capital Structure Provides Investment Flexibility: We have $1.25 billion available from unsecured revolving credit facilities that expire in 2021 and 2022, thereby limiting our near-term financial markets exposure. Given our relatively limited future capital commitments, we have the resources to take advantage of future investment opportunities. Our large unencumbered asset base and our unsecured revolving lines of credit give us access to the unsecured bond market, which we expect will allow us to pursue a flexible and opportunistic investment strategy over the long-term.
•Experienced Management Team with Significant Expertise: Each member of our management team has more than twenty years of industry experience and we have expertise in the acquisition, leasing, financing, technical management, restructuring/repossession and sale of aviation assets. This experience spans several industry cycles and a wide range of business conditions and is global in nature. We believe our management team is highly qualified to manage and grow our aircraft portfolio and to address our long-term capital needs.
•Global and Scalable Business Platform: We operate through offices in the United States, Ireland and Singapore, using a modern asset management system designed specifically for aircraft operating lessors and capable of handling a significantly larger aircraft portfolio. We believe that our current facilities, systems and personnel are capable of supporting an increase in our revenue base and asset base without a proportional increase in overhead costs.
Business Strategy
Our traditional business approach is to continue to remain differentiated from those of other large leasing companies. The global disruption that occurred as a result of the COVID-19 crisis has required enhanced focus on diligent, proactive risk monitoring while continuing to pursue our core strategies. Our focus is to manage risk and secure liquidity while also planning to grow our business and profits over the long-term. By limiting long-term capital commitments and maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure as we remain in this unprecedented situation, we seek to best position ourselves for investment opportunities in future periods of recovery.
Our business strategy entails the following elements:
•Pursuing a disciplined and differentiated investment strategy. In our view, the relative values of different aircraft change over time. We evaluate investments across different aircraft models, ages, lessees and acquisition sources and re-evaluate these choices as market conditions and relative investment values change. We believe our team’s experience with a wide range of asset types and the financing flexibility offered through unsecured debt provides us with a competitive advantage. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have intentionally limited large, long-term capital commitments and are less reliant on orders for new aircraft from aircraft manufacturers as a source of new investments than many of our competitors. While our current posture is defensive given the macro situation, over the long-term we plan to grow our business and profits while maintaining a conservative, flexible capital structure. 
•Selling assets when attractive opportunities arise. We sell assets with the aim of realizing profits and reinvesting proceeds. We also use asset sales for portfolio management purposes, such as reducing lessee specific concentrations and lowering residual value exposures to certain aircraft types.
•Maintaining efficient access to capital from a wide set of sources and leveraging our recent investment grade credit rating. We believe the aircraft investment market is influenced by the business cycle. Our strategy is to increase our purchase activity when prices are low and to emphasize asset sales when prices are high. To implement this approach, we believe it is important to maintain access to a wide variety of financing sources. During 2018, we improved our corporate credit ratings to an investment grade level by maintaining strong portfolio and capital structure metrics while achieving a critical size through accretive growth. We believe our investment grade rating not only reduces our borrowing costs, but also facilitates more reliable access to both unsecured and secured debt capital throughout the business cycle. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access capital on a cost-effective basis and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•Leveraging our strategic relationships. We intend to capture the benefits provided through the extensive global contacts and relationships maintained by our shareholders, Marubeni and Mizuho Leasing, which have enabled greater access to Japanese-based financing and helped source and develop our joint venture.
•Capturing the value of our efficient operating platform and strong operating track record. We believe our team’s capabilities in the global aircraft leasing market place us in a favorable position to explore new income-generating activities as capital becomes available for such activities. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on investment opportunities in areas where we believe we have competitive advantages and on transactions that offer attractive risk/return profiles.
Acquisitions and Sales
We originate acquisitions and sales through well-established relationships with airlines, other aircraft lessors, financial institutions and brokers, as well as other sources. We believe that sourcing such transactions globally through multiple channels provides for a broad and relatively consistent set of opportunities.
Our objective is to develop and maintain a diverse operating lease portfolio. We review our operating lease portfolio to sell aircraft opportunistically, to manage our portfolio diversification and to exit from aircraft investments when we believe selling will achieve better expected risk-adjusted cash flows than reinvesting in and re-leasing the aircraft. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Acquisitions and Sales.”
We have an experienced acquisition and sales team based in Stamford, Connecticut; Dublin, Ireland; and Singapore that maintains strong relationships with a wide variety of market participants throughout the world. We believe that our seasoned personnel and extensive industry contacts facilitate our access to acquisition and sales opportunities and that our strong operating track record facilitates our access to debt and equity capital markets.
Potential investments and sales are evaluated by teams comprised of marketing, technical, risk management, finance and legal professionals. These teams consider a variety of aspects before we commit to purchase or sell an aircraft, including price, specification/configuration, age, condition and maintenance history, operating efficiency, lease terms, financial condition and liquidity of the lessee, jurisdiction, industry trends and future redeployment potential and values. We believe that utilizing a cross-functional team of experts to consider investment parameters helps us assess more completely the overall risk and return profile of potential acquisitions and helps us move forward expeditiously on letters of intent and acquisition documentation.
Finance
We believe that cash on hand, payments received from lessees and other funds generated from operations, unsecured borrowings, borrowings from our revolving credit facilities, secured borrowings for aircraft, and other borrowings and proceeds from future aircraft sales will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months. We may choose to repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long-term debt financings, additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations and asset sales. Our ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft 
or other aviation assets, depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Secured Debt Financings” and “ — Unsecured Debt Financings” under Item 7.
Segments
The Company manages, analyzes and reports on its business and results of operations on the basis of one operating segment: leasing, financing, selling and managing commercial flight equipment. Our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker.
Aircraft Leases
Our aircraft are net leases whereby we retain the benefit, and bear the risk, of re-leasing and of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease. Leasing can be an attractive alternative to ownership for an airline because leasing increases an airline’s fleet flexibility, requires lower capital commitments, and significantly reduces aircraft residual value risks for the airline. Typically, the lessee agrees to lease an aircraft for a fixed term, although certain of our leases allow the lessee the option to extend the lease for an additional term or, in rare cases, terminate the lease prior to its expiration.
The scheduled maturities of our aircraft leases by aircraft type grouping currently are as follows, taking into account sales, sale agreements, lease placements and renewal commitments as of April 15, 2021, by fiscal year:

Aircraft Type | 2021 | 2022 | | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | | 2029 | 2032 | Off-Lease(1) | | Sold or Sale Agreement | Total

______________
(1)Consisted of four A320-200 aircraft, two Airbus A321-200 aircraft, three Airbus A330-200 aircraft and two Boeing 737-800 aircraft which we are marketing for lease or sale.
Fiscal Year 2021 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements
As of April 15, 2021, we have eleven off-lease aircraft and ten aircraft with leases expiring in fiscal 2021, which combined account for 8% of our net book value at February 28, 2021, still to be placed or sold.
Fiscal Year 2022-2025 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements
Taking into account lease and sale commitments, we currently have the following number of aircraft with lease expirations scheduled in fiscal years 2022-2025, representing the percentage of our net book value at February 28, 2021, specified below:
•2022: 21 aircraft, representing 6%;
•2023: 43 aircraft, representing 13%;
•2024: 57 aircraft, representing 23%; and
•2025: 36 aircraft, representing 16%.
Lease Payments and Security. Each of our leases requires the lessee to pay periodic rentals during the lease term. As of February 28, 2021, rentals on more than 97% of our leases, as a percentage of net book value, are fixed and do not 
vary according to changes in interest rates. For the remaining leases, rentals are payable on a floating interest-rate basis. Virtually all lease rentals are payable monthly in advance, and all lease rentals are payable in U.S. dollars.
Under our leases, the lessee must pay operating expenses payable or accrued during the term of the lease, which normally include maintenance, overhaul, fuel, crew, landing, airport and navigation charges, certain taxes, licenses, consents and approvals, aircraft registration and insurance premiums. Typically, the lessee is required to make payments for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components of the aircraft. These maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time, depending upon the component, and are either made monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term. Our determination of whether to permit a lessee to make a single maintenance payment at the end of the lease term, or to require such payments to be made monthly, depends on a variety of factors, including the creditworthiness of the lessee, the amount of security deposit which may be provided by the lessee and market conditions at the time. If a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments, we would typically be obligated to use the funds paid by the lessee during the lease term to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components, usually following completion of the relevant work. If a lease requires an end of lease maintenance payment, the lessee would typically be required to pay us for its utilization of the aircraft during the lease. In some cases, however, we may owe a net payment to the lessee in the event heavy maintenance is performed and the aircraft is returned to us in better condition than at lease inception.
Many of our leases also contain provisions requiring us to pay a portion of the cost of modifications to the aircraft performed by the lessee at its expense if such modifications are mandated by recognized airworthiness authorities. Typically, these provisions would set a threshold, below which the lessee would not have a right to seek reimbursement and above which we may be required to pay a portion of the cost incurred by the lessee. The lessees are obliged to remove liens on the aircraft other than liens permitted under the leases.
Our leases generally provide that the lessees’ payment obligations are absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and require lessees to make payments without withholding payment on account of any amounts the lessor may owe the lessee or any claims the lessee may have against the lessor for any reason, except that under certain of the leases a breach of quiet enjoyment by the lessor may permit a lessee to withhold payment. The leases also generally include an obligation of the lessee to gross up payments under the lease where lease payments are subject to withholding and other taxes, although there may be some limitations to the gross up obligation, including provisions which do not require a lessee to gross up payments if the withholdings arise out of our ownership or tax structure. In addition, changes in law may result in the imposition of withholding and other taxes and charges that are not reimbursable by the lessee under the lease or that cannot be so reimbursed under applicable law. Our leases also generally require the lessee to indemnify the lessor for tax liabilities relating to the leases and the aircraft, including in most cases, value added tax and stamp duties, but excluding income tax or its equivalent imposed on the lessor.
Portfolio Risk Management
Our objective is to build and maintain a lease portfolio which is balanced and diversified and delivers returns commensurate with risk. We have portfolio concentration objectives to assist in portfolio risk management and highlight areas where action to mitigate risk may be appropriate, and take into account the following:
•individual lessee exposures;
•geographic concentrations;
•aircraft type concentrations;
•portfolio credit quality distribution; and
•lease maturity distribution.
We have a risk management team which undertakes detailed due diligence on lessees when aircraft are acquired with a lease already in place and for placement of aircraft with new lessees following lease expiration or termination.
Lease Management and Remarketing
Our aircraft re-leasing strategy is to develop opportunities proactively, well in advance of scheduled lease expiration, to enable consideration of a broad set of alternatives, including deployment, sale or part-out, and to allow for reconfiguration or maintenance lead times where needed. We also take a proactive approach to monitoring the credit quality of our customers, and may seek early return and redeployment of aircraft if we feel that a lessee is unlikely to 
perform its obligations under a lease. We have invested significant resources in developing and implementing what we consider to be state-of-the-art lease management information systems and processes to enable efficient management of aircraft in our portfolio.
Other Aviation Assets and Alternative New Business Approaches
We believe investment opportunities may arise in related areas such as financing secured by commercial jet aircraft as well as jet engine and spare parts leasing, trading and financing. In the future, we may make opportunistic investments in these or other sectors or in other aviation-related assets, and we intend to continue to explore other income-generating activities and investments.
We source and service investments for our joint venture and provide marketing, asset management and administrative services to it. We are paid market based fees for these services, which are recorded in Other revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We believe we have a world class servicing platform and may also pursue opportunities to capitalize on these capabilities such as providing aircraft management services for third party aircraft owners.
Competition
The aircraft leasing and trading industry is highly competitive with a significant number of active participants. We face competition for the acquisition, placement and ultimately for the sale of aircraft. Competition for aircraft acquisitions comes from many sources, ranging from large established aircraft leasing companies to smaller players and new entrants. Competition has increased across most asset types and there has been a number of new investors in the market.
Larger lessors are generally more focused on acquiring new aircraft via direct orders with the original equipment manufacturers and through purchase and lease-back transactions with airlines. These larger lessors include AerCap Holdings, GE Capital Aviation Services, Air Lease Corporation, SMBC Aviation Capital, BOC Aviation, Avolon Holdings, Aviation Capital Group, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Development Bank. In March 2021, AerCap and General Electric announced an agreement where AerCap would take over GE Capital Aviation Services.
Competition for mid-aged and older aircraft typically comes from other competitors that, in many cases, rely on private equity or hedge fund capital sources. Such competitors include Carlyle Aviation Partners, Castlelake, Merx Aviation and other players funded by alternative investment funds and companies. These companies are typically fund-based, rather than having permanent capital structures, and have benefited from the availability of debt financing for mid-aged aircraft. In March 2021 Carlyle Aviation Partners announced an agreement to purchase Fly Leasing Ltd.
Competition for leasing/re-leasing aircraft, as well as aircraft sales, is based principally upon the availability, type and condition of the aircraft, user base, lease rates, prices and other lease terms. Aircraft manufacturers, leasing companies, airlines and other operators, distributors, equipment managers, financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing, managing, marketing or remarketing aircraft compete with us, although their focus may be on different market segments and aircraft types.
Some of our competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources and may have a lower cost of capital. A number also commit to speculative orders of new aircraft to be placed on operating lease upon delivery from the manufacturer, which compete with new and used aircraft offered by other lessors. However, we believe that we are able to compete favorably in aircraft acquisition, leasing and sales activities due to the reputation of our team of experienced professionals, extensive market contacts and expertise in sourcing and acquiring aircraft. We also believe our access to unsecured debt provides us with a competitive advantage in pursuing investments quickly and reliably and in acquiring aircraft in situations where it may be more difficult to finance on a secured, non-recourse basis.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and Human Capital
Our Culture
Our Company was formed in 2004 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others. These values continue to this day and are embodied in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board 
of Directors of the Company to serve as a statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business. We believe that our commitment to our Company, our employees and the communities within which we operate has led to high employee satisfaction and low employee turnover, and our commitment to our customers and business partners has resulted in high customer satisfaction, as evidenced by long-time relationships with our customers and new/repeat transactions with our business partners.
We also take environmental and social issues seriously. We believe that our commitment to identifying and implementing positive environmental and social related business practices strengthens our Company, and better serves our customers, our communities and the broader environment within which we conduct our business. 
Human Capital
As of February 28, 2021, we had 107 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that we maintain excellent employee relations.
We believe that our commitment to our employees is critical to our continued success, leading to high employee satisfaction and low employee turnover. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to have a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Each year, we review employee career development and succession planning internally and with our Compensation Committee. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our employees, customers and business partners were and are of the highest priority for us, prompting us to put a comprehensive range of protective measures in place at an early stage of the pandemic. We have been able to successfully operate with most of our workforce working remotely. We expect to start to transition to having our employees return to our offices over time, although we will continue to monitor trends and local government regulations and guidelines, and may adjust our return to office plans accordingly to ensure the health and safety of our employees.
Our employees share our corporate values of integrity, common decency and respect of others, values which have been established since our Company was formed.
Insurance
We require our lessees to carry general third-party legal liability insurance, all-risk aircraft hull insurance (both with respect to the aircraft and with respect to each engine when not installed on our aircraft) and war-risk hull and legal liability insurance. We are named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies carried by our lessees, and we or one of our lenders would typically be designated as a loss payee in the event of a total loss of the aircraft. We maintain contingent hull and liability insurance coverage with respect to our aircraft which is intended to provide coverage for certain risks, including the risk of cancellation of the hull or liability insurance maintained by any of our lessees without notice to us, but which excludes coverage for other risks such as the risk of insolvency of the primary insurer or reinsurer.
We maintain insurance policies to cover non-aviation risks related to physical damage to our equipment and property, as well as with respect to third-party liabilities arising through the course of our normal business operations (other than aircraft operations). We also maintain limited business interruption insurance to cover a portion of the costs we would expect to incur in connection with a disruption to our main facilities, and we maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing coverage for liabilities related to the service of our directors, officers and certain employees. Consistent with industry practice, our insurance policies are generally subject to deductibles or self-retention amounts.
We believe the insurance coverage currently carried by our lessees and by Aircastle provides adequate protection against the accident-related and other covered risks involved in the conduct of our business. However, there can be no assurance that we have adequately insured against all risks, that lessees will at all times comply with their obligations to maintain insurance, that our lessees’ insurers and re-insurers will be or will remain solvent and able to satisfy any claims, that any particular claim will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
Government Regulation
The air transportation industry is highly regulated, although Aircastle itself is generally not directly subject to most air transportation regulations as we do not operate aircraft. In contrast, our lessees are subject to extensive, direct regulation under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are registered and where they operate. Such laws govern, among other things, the registration, operation, security, and maintenance of our aircraft, environmental issues and the financial oversight of their operations.
Regulations regarding CO2 emissions are changing and developing, particularly so in relation to the aviation sector, where there is an additional international angle to the regulation. The impact of COVID-19 on the airline sector has further complicated matters. Further regulatory changes are expected in the coming years.
Our customers may also be subject to noise regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate our aircraft as well as other environmental regulations relating to discharges to surface and subsurface waters, management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste materials. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Aviation Assets — The effects of emissions and noise regulations and policies may negatively affect the airline industry. This may cause lessees to default on their lease payment obligations and may limit the market for certain aircraft in our portfolio” for more information.
