Our Vision
 Build the world’s premier platform to research, discover, buy and sell vehicles. 
 Our Company 
 Vroom is an innovative, end-to-end ecommerce platform that is transforming the used vehicle industry by offering a better way to buy and a better way to sell used vehicles. We are deeply committed to creating an exceptional experience for our customers. 
 We are driving enduring change in the industry on a national scale. We take a vertically integrated, asset-light approach that is reinventing all phases of the vehicle buying and selling process, from discovery to delivery and everything in between. Our platform encompasses: 
  
• | Ecommerce: We offer an exceptional ecommerce experience for our customers. In contrast to legacy dealerships and the peer-to-peer market, we provide consumers with a personalized and intuitive ecommerce interface to research and select from thousands of fully reconditioned vehicles. Our platform is accessible at any time on any device and provides transparent pricing, real-time financing and nationwide contact-free delivery right to a buyer’s driveway. For consumers looking to sell or trade in their vehicles, we provide attractive market-based pricing, real-time price quotes and convenient, at-home vehicle pick-up.

• | Vehicle Operations: Our scalable and vertically integrated operations underpin our business model. We strategically source inventory from auctions, consumers, rental car companies, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and dealers. We improve our ability to acquire high-demand vehicles through enhanced supply science across all our sourcing channels and we have expanded our national marketing efforts to drive consumer sourcing. In our reconditioning and logistics operations, we deploy an asset-light strategy that optimizes a combination of ownership and operation of assets by us with strategic third-party partnerships. This hybrid approach provides flexibility, agility and speed without taking on unnecessary risk and capital investment, and drives improved unit economics and operating leverage.

• | Data Science and Experimentation: Data science and experimentation are at the core of everything we do. We rely on data science, machine learning and A/B and multivariate testing to continually drive optimization and operating leverage across our ecommerce and vehicle operations. We leverage data to increase the effectiveness of our national brand and performance marketing, enhance the customer experience, analyze market dynamics at scale, calibrate our vehicle pricing and optimize our overall inventory sales velocity. On the operations side, data science and experimentation enable us to fine tune our supply, sourcing and logistics models and to streamline our reconditioning processes.

 The U.S. used automotive market is the largest consumer product category and is highly fragmented with over 42,000 dealers and millions of peer-to-peer transactions. It also is ripe for disruption as an industry that is notorious for consumer dissatisfaction and has one of the lowest levels of ecommerce penetration. Our platform, coupled with our national presence and brand, provides a significant competitive advantage versus local dealerships and regional players that lack nationwide reach and scalable technology, operations and logistics. The traditional auto dealers and peer-to-peer market do not and cannot offer consumers what we offer. 
 
In December 2015, we acquired Houston-based Texas Direct Auto® (“TDA”), which included our proprietary vehicle reconditioning center (“Vroom VRC”), the TDA dealership and our Sell Us Your Car® centers. From the launch of our combined operations in January 2016, our business has grown significantly as we have scaled our operations, developed our ecommerce platform and leveraged the network effects inherent in our model. We intend to continue to invest in growth to scale our company responsibly and drive towards profitability. 
 
On June 11, 2020, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”), in which we sold 24,437,500 shares of common stock, which included 3,187,500 shares sold pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received proceeds of approximately $504.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and before deducting offering expenses of $7.5 million, from sales of our shares in the IPO. 
 
On January 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the CarStory business, a leader in AI-powered analytics and digital services for automotive retail, through the acquisition of 100% of Vast Holdings, Inc. Leveraging its machine learning, informed by more than 7 million listings per day and more than 18 million consumer sessions per month, CarStory

brings the industry’s most complete and accurate view of predictive market data to our national ecommerce and vehicle operations platform. As part of Vroom, we expect CarStory to continue to drive automotive retail innovation by aggregating, optimizing, and distributing current market data from thousands of automotive sources and offering its digital retailing services to dealers, top automotive financial services companies and household names in automotive industry research and retailing. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the aggregate purchase price was approximately $120.0 million, comprised of cash and shares of our common stock. The purchase price is subject to adjustment for certain working capital adjustments and post-closing indemnities.
 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
 The U.S. used automotive industry is a massive market that is ripe for disruption due to its fragmentation, high level of consumer dissatisfaction, changing consumer buying patterns and lack of ecommerce and technology penetration. 
The U.S. Used Automotive Market is Massive and Highly Fragmented 
 In 2019, the U.S. used automotive market was the largest consumer product category, generating approximately $841 billion from sales. Based on data from Cox Automotive, there were an estimated 37.2 million used vehicle transactions in 2020, compared to approximately 40 million transactions in 2019. The U.S. used automotive market is also highly fragmented with approximately 42,000 automotive dealers and millions of peer-to-peer transactions across the country. Across all used vehicle sales in 2018, the largest U.S. used vehicle dealer had a market-share of only 1.9%, with the top 100 used vehicle dealers collectively representing only 9.3%. 
Our Competitors Rely on an Outdated Business Model
 The traditional dealership model involves limited selection, lack of transparency, high pressure sales tactics and inconvenient hours. These shortcomings have caused many consumers to transact on their own, creating a large peer-to-peer market for used vehicles with its own set of challenges for both buyers and sellers, which can entail home visits by strangers, lack of secure payment methods or identity checks, difficulty researching available vehicles and lack of verified vehicle condition. Presented with these alternatives, the overwhelming majority of consumers are dissatisfied with the current automotive buying and selling experience. According to a Dealersocket Independent Dealership Action Report, 81% of respondents reported dissatisfaction in the car buying process. 
Consumer Buying Patterns are Changing
 The U.S. retail used automotive market is experiencing shifting consumer buying patterns from in-store towards online purchases. In particular, mobile commerce is poised for even faster growth than broader ecommerce. Consumers are increasingly focused on customized products and personalized services, while also expecting delivery of those products and services on-demand. Our model enables consumers to select not only the make and model of a vehicle, but also the model year, color, trim and options in many combinations, offering a customized shopping experience that is not possible at a traditional dealership or in the peer-to-peer market.  
 In addition, used is the new “New” as consumers have become increasingly willing to buy used goods. In 2019, 64% of vehicle shoppers considered buying a used vehicle before making a purchase decision, up from 61% in 2018.  At the same time, the average price differential between new and three-year-old used vehicles has grown in recent years and as a result, owning or leasing a new vehicle has become increasingly unaffordable. The purchase of a used vehicle enables a consumer to obtain a fully reconditioned vehicle at a higher standard of luxury or with highly sought-after features for the same dollar amount as a new, lesser-model vehicle. 
The U.S. Used Automotive Market is Growing and Resilient and Ecommerce Penetration is Just Beginning
 American consumers continue to exhibit entrenched vehicle ownership trends with approximately 284 million registered vehicles on the road in 2019, as compared to 279 million in 2018. Further, approximately 91.5% of families in the United States had at least one vehicle in 2018. Additionally, the retail used vehicle market generally has shown resilience through recessionary markets and other challenging economic cycles.
 At the same time, the used automotive market has one of the lowest ecommerce penetration levels among consumer product categories. Industry reports estimate that ecommerce penetration will grow to as much as half of all used vehicle sales by 2030. In a 2019 Cox Automotive Data survey, 49% of consumers reported that they are willing to make a vehicle purchase online. Furthermore, while it is too soon to measure the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior, recent surveys indicate a growing willingness to buy a vehicle online and reduced use of

public transportation and ride-sharing services, with respondents attributing recent vehicle purchases to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 What We Do: Offer a Better Way 
 We are driving a better way to buy and a better way to sell used vehicles and bringing about enduring change in the industry. Our platform brings together all phases of the vehicle buying and selling process in a seamless, intuitive and convenient way. We create a climate of trust and provide an exceptional experience with complete transparency by eliminating friction and sales pressure. The traditional auto dealers and peer-to-peer market do not and cannot offer consumers what we offer. We offer a better way. 
A Better Way to Buy 
 For consumers looking to buy a used vehicle, we offer a value proposition that differs markedly from traditional auto dealers and the peer-to-peer market. We are dedicated to helping customers evolve from wary shoppers to confident owners by streamlining the entire buying process, from discovery through financing to delivery, by offering the following: 

• | Enormous Selection of Inventory. We currently offer a growing inventory of thousands of low-mileage, high-demand vehicles. By making purchasing decisions based on data rather than intuition, we are able to offer a wide selection of vehicles that excite our customers. Consumers no longer have to settle for traditional dealerships with a limited number of vehicles on hand or scour local peer-to-peer listings and travel to a seller’s location. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consistent High Quality. All of our vehicles pass our detailed inspections and meet our proprietary Vroom Reconditioning Standards, which result in high-quality used vehicles backed by our free Vroom 90-Day Limited Warranty. We never lose sight of the fact that the used vehicles we sell are “new” to our customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comprehensive and Transparent Vehicle Information. We remove the asymmetry of information between dealers and consumers by providing comprehensive and transparent information on the vehicles we sell. We mitigate bait-and-switch risk through high-resolution photography and detailed product descriptions on our platform, which show our customers our vehicles from all angles, and provide third-party vehicle history reports on all of our vehicles. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customized Vehicle Search and Discovery. In addition to the size and diversity of our inventory selection, we provide buyers with a personalized, intuitive interface with detailed sorting, searching and filtering functionality. This enables our customers to research and discover the right car for their unique needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive, Market-based Pricing. We price our vehicles using data science and proprietary algorithms, ensuring that buyers receive attractive, market-based, no-haggle pricing. Our pricing strategy takes into account hundreds of variables when determining the accurate market price of a vehicle, including items beyond make, model and color that are unavailable to traditional dealerships, such as proprietary historical purchase and sales data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exceptional Customer Support. Our professional customer experience team accompanies the buyer through every step of the process to make sure all questions are answered and any concerns are addressed. In all of our customer interactions, our goal is to ensure that every customer is a delighted customer. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On-Demand Shopping and Contact-Free, Convenient Delivery Experience. We offer customers the ability to shop for their desired vehicle at any time, on any device and from any location. We also deliver our vehicles nationwide to a location of our customer’s choosing. Our on-demand shopping and contact-free, convenient delivery not only saves our customers a trip to the dealership, it provides the ultimate driveway experience. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value-Added Products. We provide seamlessly integrated, real-time, individualized financing solutions through our strategic partnerships with trusted lenders in automotive finance and give our customers access to competitive market rates. We also offer third-party protection products, including vehicle service contracts, GAP protection and tire and wheel coverage, all with transparent pricing. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assurance. Our Vroom 7-Day Return Program offers customers seven days or 250 miles to test drive their purchase with their family, versus a seven-minute test drive around the block at a dealership. This fundamentally transforms the customers’ test drive experience by providing the opportunity to see how their vehicle performs in day-to-day life. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Better Way to Sell 
 We are revolutionizing the process for consumers to sell or trade-in their vehicles. Consumers typically encounter either low-ball prices from their local dealer or face the prospect of advertising and selling the vehicle themselves in a time-consuming process through the peer-to-peer market. In contrast, we offer consumers the following: 

• | Ease of Use. We offer the ease of online submission of basic vehicle information in order to receive an appraisal. There is no trip to the dealership and no cost to submit a vehicle for sale, but rather a simple, hassle-free process enabling customers to sell us their vehicles. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On-Demand Appraisals. Our Sell Us Your Car® proposition gives customers on-demand appraisals. We utilize our extensive data insights and experience across thousands of transactions to generate a quote that reflects a competitive market-based price, providing customers a fast and easy customer experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A Real-Time Price on Every Vehicle. For every vehicle that customers submit for appraisal, we provide a real-time price. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No High-Pressure Tactics. All price quotes are good for seven days or 250 miles. This process allows customers to shop, compare and analyze the sale of their vehicle from the convenience of their home to ensure they are getting the best value, eliminating pressure to take a deal on the spot. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient, Contact-Free Vehicle Pick-ups. Our customers enjoy the convenience of national, at-home contact-free vehicle pick-up free of charge within days of accepting our price. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No Hassle Pay-offs. As an added convenience, we offer hassle-free customer payment and/or pay-off of any loans on the vehicle being sold, saving the customer time and paperwork. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 A Leading Ecommerce Platform for Used Vehicles 
 We offer an end-to-end, ecommerce platform for buying, selling, transporting, reconditioning, pricing, financing, registering and delivering vehicles nationwide. Our platform encompasses every element of the customer experience and ensures quality and consistency. Our customer-centric business model addresses the shortcomings of the traditional dealership model and peer-to-peer market. We combine high-quality and high-demand vehicles, asset-light, scalable reconditioning operations, a national logistics network and an exceptional ecommerce experience. In addition, our ability to control the entire customer value chain from demand generation to pick-up or delivery to the customer’s driveway creates operating leverage as we scale, further driving the network effects inherent in our business and contributing to our path to profitability. 
Asset-Light, Scalable Operations 
 An asset-light strategy is fundamental to our business model. We seek to optimize the combination of ownership and operation of assets by us with strategic third-party partnerships. Our strategy provides flexibility, agility and speed as we scale our business, without taking on the unnecessary risk and capital investment inherent in direct investment. 
 We employ this hybrid approach across our business and utilize strategic relationships with experienced and trusted providers to optimize reconditioning services, logistics, consumer financing and customer experience:
  
• | Reconditioning Facilities. We combine the use of our Vroom VRC and third-party vehicle reconditioning centers (“third-party VRCs”) to best meet our reconditioning needs as we continue to expand our business. We leverage our partnerships with third parties within the reconditioning industry to recondition approximately two-thirds of the vehicles in our inventory to our Vroom Reconditioning Standards, which creates capacity to scale quickly and efficiently, while simultaneously reducing our capital commitments and expanding our geographic footprint. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Logistics. We primarily have used third-party carriers for our inbound and outbound logistics operations while also developing our proprietary logistics capabilities. This has allowed us to efficiently deliver vehicles to customers throughout the United States while focusing on expanding other critical components of our business, such as the volume and selection of vehicles in our inventory. We are optimizing this hybrid approach by expanding our proprietary logistics operations, including our owned vehicle fleet. We initially are focused on expanding our last-mile delivery operations, which we expect to both improve our operating leverage and enhance our customer experience, and also have begun to invest in long-haul vehicles for hub-to-hub shipments. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VRC and Last Mile Hub Locations as of February 15, 2021


 
• | Customer Financing. By partnering with many of the largest and most trusted banks in the world, we arrange reliable vehicle financing for our customers while avoiding the increased risk associated with underwriting consumer debt and carrying financing receivables on our books. This low-risk, high-margin financing structure enables us to provide customers with an essential aspect of the vehicle-buying process without adding additional debt commitments to our balance sheet and operational cost and complexities to our business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Experience Team. In addition to our in-house customer support personnel, we have partnered with a leading customer experience management provider to operate our primary call center providing sales support to our customers. This strategy enables us to centralize our contact center services, ensure consistency in customer interactions, increase conversion and maximize operating efficiencies. We also recently engaged two additional customer service providers to expand our customer service operations as we scale our business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relentless Focus on Data Science 
 Data science is at the core of everything we do, and all aspects of our business are enhanced by data analytics. In an industry that historically used intuition and basic industry-wide data to drive purchasing and pricing decisions, we are moving from intuition to algorithm. We are expanding and continuously improving our access to data, using data science and machine learning across our business to maximize efficiency. Our proprietary technology, machine learning and data analytics models continuously optimize our marketing investments and conversion funnel, fine-tune our supply, sourcing and logistics models, calibrate our vehicle pricing, streamline our reconditioning processes and optimize our overall inventory sales velocity. Our recent acquisition of CarStory reinforces and enhances our data analytics, as CarStory continues to drive automotive retail innovation as a leader in artificial intelligence powered analytics and digital services in the automotive space.
Continuous Experimentation and Innovation at Scale 
 We strive to make key decisions based on data and testing. We continuously experiment using A/B and multivariate testing methodologies to drive conversion, innovation and improved unit economics. We test variables involved in sourcing, buying, reconditioning, and managing our inventory, and make decisions based on the data insights gained from such continuous experimentation. We integrate a full-stack statistics engine that is connected to our front-and back-end operations, enabling us to A/B test across all aspects of our business, including our marketing and conversion funnel, inventory procurement, management, refurbishment and sales processes.

National Market Penetration and Brand 
 Our national presence provides a significant competitive advantage versus local dealerships and regional players that lack scalable technology, operations and logistics, and are unable to take advantage of the efficiencies and lower costs of national brand advertising. We are able to deliver a superior customer experience through the breadth and diversity of our national inventory of thousands of vehicles on our platform. Consumers no longer have to settle for whatever the local dealer has on the lot or scour local peer-to-peer listings and travel to a seller’s location for an unknown, time-consuming experience. Additionally, our customers enjoy the convenience of national, at-home delivery and pick-up of vehicles. We also leverage our national marketing campaigns to efficiently increase brand awareness and attract and convert new customers at lower cost. Our brand’s national reach provides a significant advantage over local dealers who typically rely on costly local or regional advertising campaigns. 
Difficult to Replicate Business Model 
 Our platform overcomes the unique operational and technological challenges associated with buying and selling used vehicles in an ecommerce channel. Each vehicle that we offer through our platform has a unique vehicle identification number (“VIN”) and requires multiple touch points, including appraisal, inspection, reconditioning, photography, pricing and delivery. It requires significant funding sources to finance the acquisition of inventory, the ability to source and manage complex inventory, pricing and appraisal optimization skills, reconditioning expertise and sophisticated logistics capabilities. Given the significance of the purchase to a consumer, it also requires professional customer service and a brand that consumers can trust. These elements make our platform difficult to replicate. Our operational experience and the improvements we have made over time serve as important competitive moats. To succeed, any new entrant to ecommerce used auto sales would require data-driven automotive expertise, ecommerce capabilities and scalable operations integrated in a single platform. 
Seasoned Leadership Team and an Exceptional Culture 
 Our success to date has been built on a culture that reflects our values: s.p.e.e.d – obsessive customer service, unwavering commitment to forward progress, appreciation for the diversity and skills of our employees,  engagement and celebration of all we do, and passionate development of our people, products, brand, and communities. We maintain a deep commitment to prudent corporate governance, transparency, accountability and collaboration. Our leadership team is comprised of seasoned executives who possess cross-vertical experience in the ecommerce, technology, supply chain, logistics, retail and automotive sectors, and have a demonstrated track record of scaling businesses and achieving profitable growth. Building on lessons learned and experience leading digital disruption in other fields, we believe we can bring the same level of innovation to the automotive retail industry. Our Growth Strategies and Path to Profitability 
 The core elements of our platform—ecommerce, vehicle operations and data science and experimentation—serve as the foundation of our growth strategies and path to profitability. 
 Drive Growth 
 Our business has grown significantly as we have scaled our operations. Our growth is not attributable to a single innovation or breakthrough, but to coalescence around multiple strategies that serve as points on our flywheel. The diversity and number of vehicles in our inventory drive demand and support expanded national marketing to enable us to acquire new customers more cost effectively, allowing us to invest back into our platform to continue to improve the customer experience, all of which drives increased conversion. This flywheel revolves, builds momentum and ultimately propels our business forward as we seek to drive disciplined growth and operating leverage. 
Grow and Optimize Vehicle Inventory 
 As a data-driven business, we measure demand at the unique VIN level and use data analytics to inform our pricing and inventory selection. This enables us to curate an optimal inventory that matches market demand signals, driving higher conversion and sales. As we grow, we will continuously refine our inventory mix and expand our offerings across vehicle price points to serve a greater range of customers and increase our demand and conversion opportunities. 
 10


Expand Marketing and Maximize ROI 
 The strength of our brand and effectiveness of our advertising programs is critical to our ability to attract new customers cost effectively. Leveraging our advanced data analytics, we will continue to invest in national marketing campaigns and targeted performance marketing to identify, attract and convert new customers at lower cost. This strategy provides a significant advantage over local dealers who typically rely on costly local or regional campaigns and enables us to maximize return on our marketing spend. We also run sophisticated digital marketing across various vehicle listing sites, constantly monitoring performance and maximizing ROI with limited reliance on any one platform. 
 Deliver Exceptional Customer Experience 
 We believe that customer experience is fundamental to our ability to convert consumers into customers, attract new customers and ensure repeat customers. We seek to provide customers with an intuitive, trustworthy and convenient buying and selling experience. We will continue to invest in our platform to further streamline the transaction process for our customers, as well as invest in expanded customer service operations to support our customers and enhance the customer experience. We will also continue to invest in the development of our mobile experiences to strengthen customer engagement. We believe these investments will lead to greater consumer traffic to our platform, higher levels of customer satisfaction and increased conversion and sales. 
Increase Conversion 
 Sales conversion drives revenue growth and is an output of the acceleration of every point on the growth flywheel. We will continue to invest in our technology framework to optimize all aspects of our conversion funnel by constantly A/B testing our web and mobile applications to ensure we are displaying the features and formats that are most likely to resonate with our customers and lead to increased sales. 
Drive Profitability 
 Our business model benefits from network effects and significant operating leverage as it scales. We believe that improvements in our unit economics are the foundation to driving profitability and will be achieved by scaling and optimizing the following elements of our platform: 
Optimize Vehicle Acquisition and Pricing 
 We strategically source inventory from auctions, consumers, rental car companies, OEMs and dealers. We improve our ability to acquire the right vehicle at the right price through enhanced supply science across all our sourcing channels. We are expanding our national marketing efforts featuring our Sell Us Your Car® proposition to drive consumer sourcing. As a result, we expect to increase the number of vehicles we purchase from consumers, which typically generate higher gross profit per unit when sold compared to other inventory sources. In parallel, we continue to invest in data analytics and machine learning to optimize vehicle acquisition and pricing, increase sales velocity and drive profitability. We also are exploring third-party inventory strategies, which offers the possibility of expanding our sourcing channels while offering attractive revenue models in an asset light, debt free structure. 
Increase Reconditioning Capacity 
 As we scale our business, we intend to continue to invest in increased reconditioning capacity. In addition to achieving cost savings and operational efficiencies, we will be focused on lowering our days to sale to improve working capital efficiency. We will continue to employ a hybrid approach that combines the use of our Vroom VRC with geographically dispersed third-party VRCs to best meet our reconditioning needs. To do so, we have expanded and are continuing to expand our third-party VRC locations to provide added scale with reduced lead-time and greater flexibility. As we search for additional VRC locations, leveraging our data analytics and deep industry experience, we take into account a combination of factors, including proximity to customers, transportation costs, access to inbound inventory and the ability to expand capacity at our third-party partners’ specific locations. All of these initiatives are designed to lower reconditioning costs and inbound shipping costs per unit, and thereby improve per unit economics while enhancing the customer experience. 
 11


Expand Value-Added Products 
 Every vehicle sale creates potential for multiple additional revenue streams, including fees earned on third-party vehicle financing and fees from the sale of other value-added products. As we expand our business, we believe there are substantial opportunities to increase attachment rates on our existing value-added products through training, merchandising and technology enhancements. Strategic partnerships with lenders such as Chase and Santander provide enhanced revenue streams for us, as well as offering convenience, assurance and efficiency for our customers. Introducing new types of vehicle related finance and protection products can provide additional revenues going forward. Because we are paid fees on the value-added products we sell, our gross profit on such products is equal to the revenue we generate on such sales. In addition to expanding our offering of value-added products, in the longer term, we see a significant opportunity to provide our customers with complementary services such as entertainment and location-based services. The addition of new value-added products and services will not only increase our product offerings and profitability but will also strengthen and extend our interactions with customers. 
Strategically Develop Logistics Network 
 For our logistics operations, we primarily have used national third-party carriers, which has allowed us to efficiently deliver vehicles to customers throughout the United States while focusing on expanding other critical components of our business, such as the volume and selection of vehicles in our inventory. We optimized our third-party logistics network nationally through the development of strategic carrier arrangements with national haulers and consolidated our carrier base into dedicated operating regions. This strategy enhanced the flexibility, agility and speed of our growth while reducing the need for additional capital commitments as we scaled our business. In part as a result of a reduced supply of carriers, increased shipping prices and deteriorating service levels at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to further enhance the quality of our logistics operations and our customer experience, we have been accelerating our strategy to optimize our hybrid approach by expanding our proprietary logistics network and improving our operating leverage. Initially, we have been prioritizing investment in our last-mile delivery operations, where we can have the greatest impact on the customer experience, and also have begun to invest in long-haul vehicles for hub-to-hub shipments. Consistent with our hybrid approach, as we continue to scale our business, we will strategically combine the operation of our expanded proprietary fleet with the use of third-party carriers, which will enable us to both accommodate our rapid growth and provide the highest level of customer service. 
Capitalize on New Product and Market Opportunities 
 Expand our Platform to Additional Products and Markets 
 We have designed and built an innovative platform with countless potential applications. We have the potential to leverage our platform for expansion into adjacent areas of technology-enabled commerce and fully deploy our technology, data analytics and business experience to take advantage of the opportunities this creates. We will have the flexibility to strategically pursue opportunities across markets, potentially including additional transportation and vehicle markets, global geographic markets and B-to-B business models. 
Continue to Innovate on New Capabilities 
 Technological developments have had a significant impact on the automobile industry and are expected to continue to have an impact for the foreseeable future. Electrification and shared mobility in particular are expected to have a transformative impact on road transportation. We continuously monitor developments in autonomy, ride-hailing and ride-sharing as it relates to the overall automotive market, and we are well-positioned to expand our capabilities to participate actively as the industry evolves. As the automotive landscape develops, we will seek to capitalize on new opportunities. 
Our Marketing 
 We operate a multi-channel marketing strategy that includes both national brand and digital performance marketing. We leverage various digital performance channels, including automotive aggregator sites, to generate demand for Vroom inventory by VIN. In these channels, we manage the national distribution footprint of each VIN by continually optimizing its forward distribution to maximize consumer demand and achieve planned conversion, sales velocity and profitability. 
 Our national brand campaign through TV and online media, which commenced in the first quarter of 2019, has shown strong momentum in its first two years. Because brand leads convert at a higher rate than all other marketing channels, we believe that continued growth of our national brand marketing campaign and an increasing mix of brand leads will improve our marketing efficiency. We also have expanded our national marketing efforts to feature our Sell Us Your Car® proposition to drive consumer sourcing of vehicles, which typically generate higher gross profit per unit when sold compared to other inventory sources.

We analyze visitor traffic and customer interaction with our platform to identify and correlate visitor behavior with sales conversion. Our analytics enable us to measure and monitor the ROI generated by our marketing placements, which we then use to optimize placement and spend across marketing channels to balance sales velocity and profitability. 
 
Our Technology 
 Technology and data science are the foundation of all of our operations and strategic decision making. 
 Our team of data scientists and engineers continuously extract and analyze additional information, processing millions of data points daily to create models that inform purchasing, pricing and market decisions, allowing us to understand price elasticity, and also allowing us to price a significant majority of the vehicles we acquire from consumers in just a few seconds. We adjust price as a function of overall market value trend, taking into account competitor inventory, market price fluctuations, and relative inventory advantages. 
 Core to our underlying technology is the real-time collection of customer and inventory data. We analyze and act on the data in real time. As our systems collect new or updated incoming data signals, those signals are immediately available to downstream systems to trigger parallel event processes. Our technology supports multi-channel engagement with our customers, delivering consistent messaging via the web, in native apps and via email. In cases where customers need attention outside of our ecommerce experience, we provide customer assistance via phone. 
 In addition, CarStory drives automotive retail innovation by aggregating, optimizing, and distributing current market data from thousands of automotive sources.

 Competition
 The U.S. used vehicle market is highly fragmented, with over 42,000 traditional franchised and independent dealerships nationwide as well as the peer-to-peer market. The players in the used vehicle market can be classified into the following segments: 

• | traditional new and used car dealerships;
--+------------------------------------------


• | large, national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including “omni-channel” offerings;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | used car dealers or marketplaces that currently have existing ecommerce businesses or online platforms, such as Carvana;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites such as Facebook, Craigslist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles which were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Enterprise Car Sales.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Internet and online automotive sites could change their models to sell used vehicles and compete with us, such as Google, Amazon, AutoTrader.com, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, Autobytel.com, TrueCar.com, CarGurus and Cars.com. In addition, automobile manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen could change their sales models to better compete with our model through technology and infrastructure investments. While such enterprises may change their business models and endeavor to compete with us, the sale of used vehicles through ecommerce presents unique operational and technical challenges. See “Business—Our Competitive Strengths—Difficult to Replicate Business Model.” 
 We view our main competitors to be the traditional auto dealers, who make up the significant portion of U.S. used vehicle sales and are still operating under an outdated business model that is ripe for disruption. 
 
Description of Human Capital Management
 
Vroom believes in and adheres to a core set of values and Rules of the Road that guide our actions at work. Those values are summed up as s.p.e.e.d: obsessive customer service, unwavering commitment to forward progress, an appreciation for the diversity and skills of our employees, engagement and celebration of all we do, and passionate development of our people, products, brand, and communities. Our core values are embedded in our culture through our onboarding, training, operations and communication. All of our employees receive Driver’s Manuals that outline and define 
 13


these values and all new hires are invited to listen to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief People and Culture Officer discuss the Company’s Mission, Vision, and Values, and those values inform everything we do.  
 
At the center of Vroom’s values are its employees, without whom we could not achieve our vision of building the world’s premier platform to research, discover, buy and sell vehicles.  
 

As of December 31, 2020, Vroom employed a total of 944 employees. The total consisted of 25.5% reconditioning and logistics staff, 48.6% corporate and transactional staff, 13% technical and engineering staff, and 12.8% retail staff. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
 
Engaging Talent
 
Each year, we conduct an annual engagement survey of our employees, both to measure our employees’ collective sentiment, and also to focus our efforts on maintaining a workplace where employees can bring their whole selves to work and do their best work every day. We used our 2019 annual engagement survey to identify four key areas for improvement and, through a series of targeted initiatives, we saw improvement across each topic in our 2020 annual engagement survey results:

Focus Area | Year over Year change 2019 to 2020 
Improving employee’s perception that the organization was listening to and acting upon employee feedback | +6% 
Improving individual employee recognition | +25% 
More effectively managing change in the organization | +5% 
Increasing perceptions of fair compensation | +4%

Measuring Talent
 We use a variety of human capital measures in managing our business, including diversity, attrition, hiring, promotions, and leadership. We also use certain talent management metrics, including retention rates of top talent and hiring metrics.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 Diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) are cornerstones of the Vroom values, emphasized most strongly in the s.p.e.e.d. values of Employees and Engagement. During 2020, we made progress on a number of our diversity initiatives:
 Representation
  
• | We added two female members to our board of directors, bringing representation of our non-employee directors to 33% female as of December 31, 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The percentage of women in our workforce increased from 33.0% as of December 31, 2019 to 40.6% as of December 31, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efforts to improve race and ethnicity-related voluntary reporting by our employees greatly improved our confidence in the data reported in 2020 relative to 2019. In 2019, 32.6% of our employees did not report a race or ethnicity. That number dropped to 8.2% by the end of 2020.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Based on the reported race and ethnicity-related data, non-white representation among our employees stayed nearly flat at 68.5% as of December 31, 2019 and 67.9% as of December 31, 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Employee Race and Ethnicity | 
-----------------------------------+-----------------------------+--------
 | 2019 | 2020 | Change 
Asian | 7.88% | 8.07% | 0.20% 
Black / African American | 20.33% | 25.26% | 4.93% 
Hispanic / Latino | 35.71% | 29.53% | (6.19)%
Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander | 0.55% | 0.35% | (0.20)%
Two or More Races | 2.20% | 2.54% | 0.34% 
White | 31.50% | 32.06% | 0.56% 
I do not wish to answer | 1.83% | 2.19% | 0.36% 
Total | 100.00% | 100.00% | 

Inclusion
  
• | During the summer of 2020, in the midst of social unrest, we held a number of listening sessions to discuss the experiences of our employees — with particular emphasis on our African American colleagues. These sessions were well attended and well received by our employees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We also established a cross functional Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee tasked with working with our Senior Leadership Team on efforts aimed at improving DEI experiences and outcomes for our employees. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee has begun making recommendations for Company-wide training, communication, and other efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to our required anti-harassment training, we have introduced mandatory implicit bias training to heighten awareness across the organization.

Workplace Health & Safety 
 Vroom takes a comprehensive approach to workplace health and safety. During 2020, efforts were largely focused on addressing the spread of COVID-19, especially given the in-person nature of the work of many of Vroom’s employees, including our reconditioning, titling, and document support staff. 
 In response to the COVID-19 disruptions, we implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce. These measures include restrictions on non-essential business travel, the institution of work-from-home policies wherever feasible and the implementation of strategies for workplace safety at our facilities. We are following and require all of our on-site vendors to follow the guidance from public health officials and government agencies, including implementation of enhanced cleaning measures, social distancing guidelines, wearing of masks, eliminating non-essential 
 15


vendor / guest visitation, and requiring temperature checks and health attestations prior to entering buildings. Seating, signage, and cleaning materials have been added to ensure adherence to best practices for employee health and safety during this pandemic. In addition, we have leased additional office space to ensure sufficient in-office capacity while providing adequate spacing of our employees. Where feasible, we operate on a rotating team schedule to reduce exposure and also require any diagnosed or exposed employees to self-isolate for up to two weeks. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a cross functional working group was formed to focus on COVID-related matters of space and remote work and continues to meet bi-weekly to ensure up-to-date safety protocols and efficient responses to new information. 
 

Compensation & Rewards 
 
COVID-19 Related Actions
 
Reduced unit volume in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a furlough of approximately one-third of our staff as well as salary reductions for our remaining staff. Employees were given two weeks’ notice prior to any furlough action and remained on Company-provided benefits for the duration of the furlough. Approximately 77% of those employees furloughed were returned to work within 60 days and only 13% were ultimately terminated. Each of these terminated employees received standard separation benefits, including outplacement and separation pay.
 In May 2020, salary reductions were instituted relative to level and overall compensation in the organization. The option to work overtime was eliminated for hourly employees and salaried employees experienced reductions at the most junior level of 5%, up to 25% for our Chief Executive Officer. Salaries were returned to pre-COVID levels by July of 2020, with our Chief Executive Officer being the last employee to have his full salary restored.  
 General Compensation 
 
Our compensation philosophy is driven by the desire to attract and retain top talent, while ensuring that compensation aligns with our corporate and financial objectives and the long-term interests of our stockholders. We have developed a pay structure that offers a competitive total compensation package including base salary, bonus, equity, and other position-specific incentives.  Annual bonus plans are tied to both company and individual performance factors.  
 
Our comprehensive benefit plans offer medical, dental and vision insurance and long and short-term disability, as well as flexible spending accounts and other voluntary coverage to all of our employees. We routinely benchmark our salaries and benefits against market peers to ensure our total rewards package remains competitive.  
 
Communication & Talent Development
 A key part of Vroom’s operating philosophy is ensuring that employees are learning and developing as well as providing input into Vroom’s daily operations. In addition to a standard engagement survey and formal feedback tool, Vroom has implemented a number of systems designed to improve feedback to and from employees. They are described below:

System / Tool | Description / Purpose 
Pit Crew Meetings | Frequent small group meetings between employees and a senior leader in the organization to share business updates and surface ideas for improvements in the business and employee experience. 
Town Hall Style Meetings with Chief Executive Officer | Quarterly town-hall style meetings where business results are shared and employees submit questions to the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Leadership Team regarding a wide range of topics.
Check Engine System | An anonymous forum for uncovering problems or challenges in the business that are then addressed by appropriate parties. 
Pit Crew Feedback | An always-on, multi-rater feedback tool that allows managers to collect feedback from their employee’s key stakeholders at the times when it’s most pertinent. 

 16


 
PaceSetter Awards | Quarterly awards that highlight employees in the business who exemplify Vroom’s values. These awards show appreciation while also setting an example for employee interactions.
Mission, Vision, Values | The Chief Executive Officer and Chief People and Culture Officer meet with all new hires in interactive sessions to discuss Vroom’s Mission, Vision, and Values in detail. 

 
The Company offers a number of developmental programs in addition to standard training on compliance-oriented topics. Offerings include content on managing bias, providing effective feedback, utilizing compensation tools, and thoughtful self-evaluation. Vroom invested in development resources during 2020, adding both a Senior Director of Learning and Development focused on broad initiatives, as well as a Director of Training & Quality Assurance focused on operational skills and measurement. We look forward to providing even more growth opportunities for the team in 2021.
 Intellectual Property 
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights, including our intellectual property rights in our technology, through trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality agreements, procedures and other contractual commitments and other legal rights. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information. 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not own any U.S. or foreign patents and do not have any U.S. or foreign patent applications pending, except for certain U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications we acquired as part of the CarStory acquisition. We own 12 registrations for our trademarks in the United States, including Vroom®, Vroom Get In®, TDA®, DealerLane®, Texas Direct®, Flag and Highway Logo and Sell Us Your Car®; and we hold registered trademarks in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Canada and Peru for the Vroom® trademark and have a number of pending applications to register the Vroom® trademark in other foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our branding strategies and technology development efforts to assess the existence, registrability, and patentability of new intellectual property. 
 As part of the CarStory acquisition, we acquired 19 U.S. patents and ten pending U.S. patent applications. In addition, we acquired ten trademark registrations and two applications for trademark registration in the United States, Canada, and Europe, including for VAST® and CARSTORY®.
 Intellectual property laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology, brands, or other intellectual property. 
 Government Regulation
 Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles are regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. The titling and registration of vehicles and the sale of value-added products also are regulated by state laws, and such laws can vary significantly from state to state. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce and the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions again unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.

State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our ecommerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. We are licensed as a dealer in the States of Texas and Florida and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under our Texas and Florida licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not subject to such states’ vehicle dealer licensing laws; however, regulators in such states could seek to require us to maintain a used vehicle dealer license in order to engage in activities in that state. In addition, we intend to obtain a used vehicle dealer license in certain additional states to maximize operational flexibility and efficiency, enhance our customer experience and invest in relationships with state regulators.
 Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice or registration document or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. We have obtained a motor vehicle sales finance license in Texas in connection with our Texas dealer license, and we have obtained a retail installment seller license in Florida in connection with our Florida dealer license. The financial regulatory agency in Pennsylvania determined that we need to obtain an installment seller license in order to enter into retail installment sales with residents of Pennsylvania. As a result, we are not currently offering third-party financing to our customers in Pennsylvania, who must obtain independent financing to the extent needed to fund any vehicle purchases on our platform. We recently obtained a Pennsylvania installment seller license and expect to resume offering financing to Pennsylvania customers in the future. In addition, we may elect to obtain sales finance or installment seller licenses in certain other states in which our customers reside in order to maximize operational flexibility and efficiency, enhance our customer experience and invest in relationships with state regulators.
 In addition, the ongoing expansion of our proprietary logistics operations exposes us to greater regulation from the U.S. Department of Transportation and state transportation regulators.
 We previously had not been operating in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts due to its prohibition on the use of temporary tags, which we typically provide to our customers upon delivery. We recently implemented a solution that enables us to sell vehicles in Massachusetts and provide customers with vehicle registration and permanent tags upon delivery.
 In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. We also are subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and Nasdaq rules.
 Additionally, we are subject to Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and other government actions, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, as well as our actual or perceived failure to protect such information could harm our reputation and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations”; “—We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations”; “—If we fail to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, we may face significant damages, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations”; “—Government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations”; “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Use of Data and Technology—We are subject to risks related to online payment methods”; “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Growth and Strategy—We are expanding our proprietary logistics operations, including vehicle pick-ups and delivery from our last mile hubs and line haul transportation of vehicles between our last mile hubs, which will further expose us to increased risks related to ownership of infrastructure and the transportation of vehicles” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic—The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Seasonality
 Used vehicle sales are seasonal. The used vehicle industry typically experiences an increase in sales early in the calendar year and reaches its highest point late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter. Vehicle sales then level off through the rest of the year, with the lowest level of sales in the fourth quarter. This seasonality has historically corresponded with the timing of income tax refunds, which are an important source of funding for vehicle purchases. Additionally, used vehicles depreciate at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. In line with these macro trends, our gross profit per unit has historically been higher in the first half of the year when compared to the second half of the year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations—We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.”
