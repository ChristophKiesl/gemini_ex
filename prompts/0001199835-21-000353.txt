Business Information and Strategy
 
As described above, the Company underwent a change in control transaction effective September 4, 2020, as a result of which new management of the Company terminated the Companys existing business operations and decided to pursue opportunities to acquire commercial real estate.
 
On December 15, 2020, the Company entered into a binding Letter of Intent with Klusman Family Holdings, LLC, and Aaron Klusman, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 100% of the membership interest in Klusman Family Holdings, LLC from Aaron Klusman, who is also Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and a Director of the Company, for consideration consisting of payments totaling $1,500,000 and the issuance of 10,945,250 shares of common stock of the Company. Klusman Family Holdings, LLC is engaged in the business of acquiring, leasing, and managing commercial real property in Arizona. The transaction is currently anticipated to close subsequent to July 31, 2021, although there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to complete this transaction. Upon closing, the Company expects that this transaction would be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization.
 
The Company has suffered losses from operations and negative operating cash flows since inception. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any business activities in commercial real estate. The Companys future business activities will be subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for and availability of additional capital.
