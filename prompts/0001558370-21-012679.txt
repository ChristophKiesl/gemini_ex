Item 1. BUSINESS
Who We Are
InnovAge is the leading healthcare delivery platform by number of participants focused on providing all-inclusive, capitated care to high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Our programs directly address two of the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. healthcare industry: rising costs and poor outcomes. Our participant-centered care delivery approach meaningfully improves the quality of care our participants receive, while keeping them in their homes for as long as safely possible and reducing over-utilization of high-cost care settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. Our participant-centered approach is led by our Interdisciplinary Care Teams (“IDTs”), who design, manage and coordinate each participant’s personalized care plan. We directly manage and are responsible for all healthcare needs and associated costs for our participants. We directly contract with government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and do not rely on third-party administrative organizations or health plans. We believe our model aligns with how healthcare is evolving, namely (i) the shift toward value-based care, in which coordinated, outcomes-driven, high-quality care is delivered while reducing unnecessary spend, (ii) eliminating excessive administrative costs by contracting directly with the government, (iii) focusing on the patient experience and (iv) addressing social determinants of health.
InnovAge Holding Corp. (formerly, TCO Group Holdings, Inc.) and certain wholly owned subsidiaries were formed as for-profit corporations effective May 13, 2016, for the purpose of purchasing all the outstanding common stock of Total Community Options, Inc. d/b/a InnovAge, which was formed in May 2007. In connection with this purchase, Total Community Options, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries converted from not-for-profit organizations to for-profit corporations, and Total Community Options Foundation, Inc. (“Foundation”) and Johnson Adult Day Program, Inc. (“Johnson”), both not-for-profit organizations, separated from Total Community Options, Inc. In connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”), which occurred in March 2021, we changed the name of our company from TCO Group Holdings, Inc. to InnovAge Holding Corp. (“InnovAge”). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to InnovAge or collectively to InnovAge and its subsidiaries.
InnovAge, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, aims to allow seniors in need of care and support to live life on their terms by aging in place, in their own homes and communities, for as long as safely possible. Through our Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”), we manage, and in many cases directly provide, a broad range of medical and ancillary services for seniors, including in-home care services (skilled, unskilled and personal care); in-center services such as primary care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dental services, mental health and psychiatric services, meals, and activities; transportation to the PACE center and third-party medical appointments; and care management. The Company manages its business as one reportable segment, PACE. 
PACE
As of June 30, 2021, the Company served approximately 6,850 PACE participants, making it the largest PACE provider in the United States of America (the “U.S.”) based upon participants served, and operated 18 PACE centers across Colorado, California, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
PACE is a fully-capitated managed care program, which serves the frail elderly, and predominantly dual-eligible, population in a community-based service model. We define dual-eligible seniors as individuals who are 55+ and qualify for benefits under both Medicare and Medicaid. InnovAge provides all needed healthcare services through an all-inclusive, coordinated model of care, and the Company is at risk for 100% of healthcare costs incurred with respect to the care of its participants. PACE programs receive capitation payments directly from Medicare Parts C and D, Medicaid, Veterans Administration (“VA”), and private pay sources. Additionally, under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) share part of the risk for providing prescription medication to the Company’s participants. We deliver our participant-centered care through the InnovAge Platform, which we have designed to bring high-touch, comprehensive, value-based care.
We believe the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model in healthcare does not adequately incentivize providers to efficiently manage this complex population. Dual-eligible seniors must navigate a disjointed, separately

administered set of Medicare and Medicaid benefits, which often results in uncoordinated care delivered in silos. Our vertically integrated care model and full-risk contracts incentivize us to coordinate and proactively manage all aspects of a participant’s health. Costs under the PACE program are estimated to be 13% lower on average than for a comparable dual-eligible population aged 65 and older under Medicaid, based on an analysis of available data by the National PACE Association in November 2020, and our costs are estimated to be approximately 8% lower on a weighted average basis than costs for comparable fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, based on our analysis of the most recent Dartmouth Atlas data from 2017. Importantly, we believe we deliver significantly better health outcomes. Our care model reduces unnecessary or avoidable medical spend. Based on an analysis performed using most recently available data from 2018, we estimate that across our mature markets, our participants on average have 16% fewer hospital admissions and 73% fewer low- to medium-severity emergency room visits relative to a comparable Medicare fee-for-service population with similar risk scores for which data is available. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, our participants had a 28% lower 30-day hospital readmission rate compared to a frail, dual-eligible or disabled waiver population. In addition to reducing spend, we also focus on ensuring our participants are satisfied and receive high-quality care. Our participant satisfaction, based on a survey of a random sample of participants and administered by an independent third party as of January 1, 2021, is 86%. Based on our analysis as of June 30, 2021, our participants live, on average, 1.4 years longer than comparable populations who choose nursing home care, based on a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) report dated June 27, 2017.
We believe our strong value proposition to each constituency translates into a superior economic model. We directly contract with Medicare and Medicaid on a per member, per month (“PMPM”) basis, which creates recurring revenue streams and provides significant visibility into our revenue growth trajectory. We receive 100% of the pooled capitated payment to directly provide or manage the healthcare needs of our participants. By proactively providing high-quality care and addressing risks related to social determinants of health, we have demonstrated our ability to reduce avoidable utilization of high-cost care settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. As a result, we create a surplus that can be used to invest in refining our care model and providing even greater social supports for our participants. These investments further improve participants’ experiences and health outcomes, which we believe will result in more savings that will drive our profitable growth. The virtuous cycle we have created enables us to consistently deliver high-quality care, achieve high participant satisfaction and retention, and attract new participants. We believe that continuing to drive medical cost savings over a growing participant census will deliver an even greater surplus to our organization, enabling us to invest in more participant programs, evolve our care model, enhance our technology and fund new centers. 
Industry Challenges
Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs. According to data from the Office of the Actuary of CMS, healthcare spending in the United States has grown at approximately 5% per year from 2014 to 2019, and in 2019 represented $3.8 trillion of annual spend, or 17.7% of U.S. GDP. The overall growth rate of healthcare spending is expected to accelerate due to the aging population. Furthermore, the government’s share of total healthcare spend through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid is expected to grow from approximately 37% in 2019 to more than 40% as early as 2024, indicating faster growth in government-sponsored healthcare than the overall market.
Government healthcare spend is disproportionally concentrated in the dual-eligible population, who typically suffer from multiple chronic conditions and require long-term services and supports. Medicare and Medicaid spend on average three times more per capita on a dual-eligible senior than a Medicare-only senior. Improved care management of dual-eligible seniors is critical to reducing the rapid growth in government healthcare spending in the United States.
Highly fragmented, uncoordinated healthcare system. The U.S. healthcare system is complex and highly fragmented, resulting in piecemeal care delivery across different providers who each lack a complete picture of the patient. Furthermore, this dynamic often makes the healthcare system difficult for patients to navigate. Primary, acute, behavioral and long-term care providers need to work together to effectively manage a patient’s care, yet, today, they work in silos. This lack of care coordination can result in missed or inaccurate diagnoses, gaps in care, unnecessary spend and ultimately sub-optimal patient outcomes.
High-cost, dual-eligible seniors are at high risk of falling through the cracks of the U.S. healthcare system. Few government-sponsored programs other than PACE bring together the Medicare and Medicaid benefit for these individuals, creating further barriers to delivering coordinated care. Dual-eligible beneficiaries are among the most medically complex,

high-frequency users of healthcare services. Based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2021, the typical InnovAge participant had, on average, eight chronic conditions and, based on our most recently available data from a 2018 health outcomes survey, required, on average, assistance with three or more activities of daily living (“ADLs”). A lack of coordination across providers can have severe consequences given the high occurrence of chronic illnesses and other underlying health issues in this population.
Prevalence of wasteful spending and sub-optimal outcomes. A 2019 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that approximately 25% of all annual healthcare spending is for unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud and other inefficiencies creating waste. At spending levels evaluated during the time of the study, this represented approximately $760 billion to $935 billion of wasteful spending. 
Proper management of chronic conditions and targeted interventions to mitigate challenges presented by social determinants of health can significantly reduce the incidence of acute episodes, which are the main driver of emergency room visits and hospitalization among the dual-eligible senior population. Healthcare spending on nursing care facilities and continuing care retirement communities was expected to reach approximately $191.8 billion in 2021, based on the latest projections made by the Office of the Actuary of CMS. Similar to spend on hospitals and other high-acuity care settings, we believe many of these dollars can ultimately be saved by providing proactive treatment and investing in proper medical and social supports to enable frail seniors to live in their homes and communities.
Despite high levels of spending, the U.S. healthcare system struggles to produce better health outcomes and delivers low levels of patient and provider satisfaction. 
Payment structures are evolving to address healthcare issues. Policymakers and healthcare experts generally acknowledge that the fee-for-service model is not designed to deliver on the “triple aim” of providing low-cost, high-quality care while improving the patient experience. Historically, healthcare delivery was oriented around reactive care for acute events, which resulted in the development of a fee-for-service payment model. By linking payments to the volume of encounters and pricing for higher complexity interventions, the fee-for-service model does not incentivize providers to practice preventative medicine or manage patients in lower cost settings. Rather, many policymakers and healthcare experts believe it unintentionally creates the opposite result—acute, episodic care delivered in high-cost settings that unnecessarily drive up the total cost of healthcare.
High-cost, dual-eligible seniors require proactive, coordinated care plans to address their medical acuity, need for long term support and risks related to social determinants of health. Without personalized, patient-centered care that removes barriers to treatment, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors would continue to over-utilize healthcare in higher-cost settings, such as emergency rooms and nursing homes.
Government payors have responded by incentivizing a transition to value-based reimbursement models for dual-eligible seniors. A recent example of this has been the growth of the PACE program.
PACE is a government-sponsored, provider-led managed care program focused on enabling frail, dual-eligible seniors who qualify to live in a nursing home to age independently in their homes. PACE providers receive a monthly risk-adjusted payment for each participant (PMPM) directly from Medicare and Medicaid to oversee the totality of medical care an enrolled participant needs. Fully capitated models, such as PACE, incentivize organizations to better manage chronic conditions to avoid high-cost acute episodes and to invest in services that fall outside the scope of a fee-for-service model. These services, such as care coordination and ancillary support to remove barriers created by social determinants of health, can have a significant impact on a participant’s overall health.
InnovAge participants are, on average, more complex and medically fragile than other Medicare-eligible patients, including those in Medicare Advantage (“MA”) programs. As a result, we receive larger payments for our participants compared to MA participants. This is driven by two factors: (i) we provide care for a higher acuity population, with an average risk adjustment factor (“RAF”) score of 2.45 based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2021, compared to an average RAF score of 1.08 for Medicare fee-for-service non-dual enrollees, as calculated in an analysis by Avalere Health in June 2020 of a cohort of individuals enrolled in Medicare Fee-for-Service in 2019, and (ii) we have Medicaid spend in addition 

3



to Medicare. Our comprehensive care model and globally capitated payments are designed to cover participants from enrollment until the end of life, including coverage for participants requiring hospice and palliative care.
The successful clinical approaches of PACE helped inform certain aspects of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s recently announced Direct Contracting Program set to begin in 2021. The Direct Contracting Program aims to create value-based payment arrangements directly with provider groups for their current Medicare fee-for-service patients. By transitioning from fee-for-service arrangements to value-based payments, CMS expects healthcare providers will be financially incentivized to simultaneously improve quality while lowering the cost of care and focusing on patient experience, as is done in PACE today.
Legacy healthcare delivery infrastructure has been slow to transition from fee-for-service to value-based care models. In order for the shift to value-based payment models to drive meaningful results, we believe there must be a corresponding shift in care delivery models. While there has been significant investment by providers, payors and technology companies in developing solutions to enable higher-quality and lower-cost care, the healthcare industry is still heavily reliant on fee-for-service reimbursement models.
The novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic has amplified several flaws in the current legacy healthcare delivery system. Traditional healthcare providers have faced dwindling fee-for-service visits in light of stay-at-home orders, government restrictions and general patient fear of medical settings. This has not only reduced revenues for traditional providers, but has strained their ability to provide necessary care for their patients. Patients with chronic conditions in the fee-for-service system have found themselves unable to access care because the broader healthcare system could not rapidly shift services from institutions to home-based environments. Patients in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, have also seen a disproportionately high infection rate as a result of the pandemic. The highly contagious nature of the virus that causes COVID-19 combined with the higher mortality rate in frail seniors created devastating conditions that led to many avoidable deaths. As of June 1, 2021, 4% of all U.S. COVID‑19 cases could be linked to long-term care facilities, according to The New York Times, but those cases translated into 31% of all U.S. COVID-19‑related deaths.
Providers that operate comprehensive value-based models, like us, were better positioned to quickly pivot their care delivery approach to safely treat patients in virtual and home-based settings without losing any revenue. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for integrated, multimodal value-based care delivery models.
Our Market Opportunity
We are one of the largest healthcare platforms focused on frail, dual-eligible seniors, and we serve participants primarily through PACE. We have built the largest PACE-focused operation in the country based on number of participants; we are twice the size of our closest PACE-focused competitor, more than 30 times larger than the typical PACE operator and the only for-profit PACE operator with a footprint in three or more states. Given our scale and track record of success across geographies, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on a significant market opportunity to provide care to frail, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors.
According to CMS, healthcare spending in the U.S. was greater than $3.6 trillion in 2018, and Medicare and Medicaid combined accounted for greater than $1.3 trillion spent on the care of approximately 125 million individuals. In 2018, there were approximately 12 million individuals simultaneously enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid that we estimate accounted for approximately $464 billion, representing 34% of combined Medicare and Medicaid spend. Our care model targets the most complex, frail subset of the dual-eligible senior population. We estimate our target population at approximately 2.2 million in 2021 based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2018, representing seniors who we believe are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and meet the nursing home eligibility criteria for PACE. We prioritize high-density urban and suburban areas, where there are sizable numbers of frail dual-eligible seniors who would benefit most from our program. We leverage the InnovAge Platform to provide comprehensive, coordinated healthcare to enable our frail, nursing home-eligible seniors to live independently in their homes and communities. We believe people want to stay in their home for as long as possible, and the InnovAge Platform empowers seniors to age independently in their own homes, on their own terms, for as long as possible.

Based on historical results for the year ended June 30, 2021 and our experience and industry knowledge, we estimate an average annual revenue opportunity of $95,000 per participant ($7,900 PMPM) and a total addressable market opportunity of $210 billion, based on our estimated market of approximately 2.2 million PACE eligible in the United States in 2021, as described above. Of these estimated PACE eligible participants, only approximately 57,000 are enrolled in a PACE program, based on an August 2021 report from the National PACE Association, and over the next seven years, the National PACE Association is targeting a PACE enrollment increase at a CAGR of approximately 17%. As a result, we believe we have a substantial runway for growth by bringing our comprehensive value-based model of care to more frail, dual-eligible seniors across the country.
The InnovAge Platform
Our participant-centered approach is tailored to address the complex medical and social needs of our frail dual-eligible senior population. We leverage the InnovAge Platform to deliver comprehensive, highly coordinated healthcare to our participants. The InnovAge Platform consists of (1) our interdisciplinary care teams and (2) our community-based care delivery model. The key attributes of the InnovAge Platform include:
Our participant focus. Our model is focused on caring for frail, high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Our target participant population is the frail, nursing home-eligible subset of dual-eligible seniors to whom we refer as “high-cost, dual-eligibles” given their high healthcare acuity and the associated high level of spend. Our participants are among the most frail and medically complex individuals in the U.S. healthcare system. Based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2021, the typical InnovAge participant had, on average, eight chronic conditions and, based on our most recently available data from a 2018 health outcomes survey, required, on average, assistance with three or more ADLs. As a result, the average InnovAge participant has a Medicare RAF of 2.45 based on InnovAge data as of June 30, 2021, compared to an average RAF score of 1.08 for Medicare fee-for-service non-dual enrollees, as calculated in an analysis by Avalere Health in June 2020 of a cohort of individuals enrolled in Medicare Fee-for-Service in 2019. A higher RAF score indicates poorer health and higher predicted health care costs. Our platform enables participants to exercise their preference to age independently in their homes and stay active in their communities for as long as safely possible. All of our participants are certified as nursing home-eligible, but, as a result of the InnovAge PACE care delivery model, as of June 2021, over 90% of our participants are able to live safely in their homes and communities.
Our interdisciplinary care teams. The IDT structure is core to our clinical model. Our IDTs oversee all aspects of each participant’s unique care plan and function as the core group of care providers to our participants. Our IDT structure is designed to enhance access to care for our participants and eliminate information silos and gaps in care that frequently occur in a fee-for-service model. We are responsible for all of our participants’ medical care, and we direct care delivery across multiple settings. We deliver individualized care for each participant that addresses both his or her specific medical conditions and social determinants of health. We deliver or manage primary and specialist care, in-home care, hospital visits, nutrition, transportation to our care centers and to other medical appointments, pharmacy and behavioral health. We leverage a technology suite, which we believe is powered by industry-leading clinical and operational information technology solutions to collect and analyze data, streamline IDT workflows and empower our teams with timely participant insights that improve outcomes.
Each IDT convenes, at a minimum, experts across at least 11 disciplines to collectively manage the complex care needs of each participant. IDTs are typically comprised of a primary care provider, registered nurse, master’s level social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, recreational therapist or activity coordinator, dietician, center manager, home care coordinator, personal care attendant and driver. The IDTs meet multiple times per week to discuss each participant’s care plan and closely monitor key clinical metrics to ensure each participant receives optimal treatment based on his or her current conditions.
Our community-based care delivery model. Our high-touch model delivers care across a continuum of community-based settings. Our multimodal approach leverages (1) the care center, (2) the home and (3) virtual care capabilities to deliver comprehensive care to our participants. Our capitated payment model gives us the flexibility to invest in care coordination, transportation and other services to mitigate challenges presented by participants’ social determinants of 

5



health, regardless of what is traditionally covered by insurance. As a result, our capabilities are not limited to what we are able to offer inside of our centers.
Our community-based care centers. Our purpose-built community-based care centers are designed for the specific needs of our target population and serve as a medical and social hub for our participants. Our participants often spend the full day in these centers receiving medical treatment, meals and physical therapy and socializing with peers. Our care centers are larger than those of most other comparable care organizations and include dedicated spaces for medical care, physical therapy, behavioral health and dentistry, in addition to day-rooms and dining spaces for socialization among our participants. We incorporate population-specific design elements, such as grab bars and rounded hallways, to accommodate the frailty and the prevalence of dementia among our participant population. The size and design of our centers enable us to deliver a significant portion of our participants’ care in one location, simplifying the healthcare experience for participants and their families.
Our in-home care capabilities. Our in-home care capabilities enable our participants to live safely in their homes and avoid nursing homes to the extent safely possible. We directly deliver or manage all skilled and unskilled care a participant may require to live independently at home. Additionally, we have dedicated strategic partnerships with “hospital-at-home” providers to deliver acute care in-home when appropriate. In addition, we manage transportation not only to our centers but also to all third-party medical appointments. Our capitated payment model gives us the flexibility to invest in home modifications, such as ramps, grab bars and shower chairs, to reduce falls and make the home safer for our seniors. We believe our presence in our participants’ homes gives us real-time insight into our participants’ health and enables us to positively influence many environmentally-driven social determinants of health.
Our virtual care capabilities. Our virtual care capabilities give us the flexibility to deliver medical care and social services virtually when appropriate. Our physicians are equipped with several telehealth platforms to provide virtual care and utilize the option best suited for each individual participant’s preferences and needs. Our aim is to make virtual care access simple and convenient for our participants. In situations where a participant is unable to use telehealth technology on their own, we dispatch a team member to their home to assist.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed our telehealth capabilities, with almost half of our provider visits and almost one quarter of IDT visits provided to our participants remotely during the year ended June 30, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the strength and adaptability of the InnovAge Platform and our community-based care delivery model. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the mix of settings where we deliver care, our multimodal approach ensures our participants continue to receive the care they need.
Addressing social determinants of health. We believe a key element of the success of our care delivery model is the provision of services that mitigate challenges presented by participants’ social determinants of health. We designed our care delivery model to address the following areas:

● | Economic stability
--+-------------------


● | Transportation
--+---------------


● | Physical environment
--+---------------------


● | Community and social context
--+-----------------------------


● | Food and nutrition
--+-------------------


● | Health literacy
--+----------------


● | Fitness
--+--------

​
Our technology suite. Our technology suite supports our ability to deliver consistent, high-quality care to our participants at scale. Our fully capitated care model is operationally complex; it requires coordination among dozens of different providers per participant, real-time integration of clinical data from disparate sources and predictive analytics to enable effective interventions. We license a suite of third-party clinical technologies that we use to create a comprehensive view of our participants’ health, empowering our IDTs to make optimal care decisions. We leverage what we believe to be industry-leading reporting and predictive analytics solutions to collect and analyze data, stratify our population and uncover actionable participant insights.

Our Track Record of Profitable Growth
We have a record of driving profitable growth and achieving compelling unit economics. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our consolidated Center-level Contribution Margin, expressed as a percentage of revenue, was 27.3% and 24.9%, respectively, and all of our centers had a positive Center-level Contribution Margin. Our de novo centers opened in the last seven years have generated positive Center-level Contribution Margins in fewer than 12 months of operation.
We have demonstrated an ability to scale successfully, expanding our model to a network of 18 centers in five states, which provided care for approximately 6,850 participants during the year ended June 30, 2021. As of June 30 2021, our eligible participant penetration rate was, on average, 13% across our existing markets, and as the only designated PACE provider in most of the MSAs that we serve, we believe there is significant runway for further growth. 
We believe our track record of successfully operating across different markets gives us an advantage when opening centers in existing and new geographies. We aim to grow the InnovAge Platform by substantially increasing the number of centers we operate in new and existing markets to positively impact the lives of more frail, dual-eligible seniors and drive long-term value for our key stakeholders: participants and their families, government payors and providers.
Our Value Proposition 
We believe that the InnovAge Platform has enabled us to create a healthcare model where all constituencies involved, including participants, their families, providers and government payors, have the ability to “Win.” Therefore, we “Win” through a virtuous cycle that promotes growth and drives our financial results.

7



Our participants “Win” by enjoying a better participant experience, improved health outcomes and remaining in their homes and communities for longer. We leverage our differentiated care delivery model to improve the health of our participants and help them avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and nursing home care. We enable our participants to remain in their homes and age independently. As a result, as of June 2021, over 90% of our participants live in their preferred setting: their home or community. Our care model also delivers superior clinical outcomes: our participants have fewer hospital admissions, fewer low- to medium-severity emergency room visits and lower 30-day hospital readmission rates. Based on our analysis as of June 30, 2021, our participants live, on average, 1.4 years longer than comparable populations who choose nursing home care, based on a report by HHS dated June 27, 2017. Our care model is not “one size fits all,” it is customized to the unique needs of each participant. This approach leads to high levels of participant satisfaction with our program.
Families “Win” as we reduce their caregiving burden and provide “peace of mind”. We significantly reduce the caregiving burden on the families of our participants. Our model handles all transportation to and from medical appointments and center visits, helps participants with ADLs, and creates social outlets for participants to reduce isolation. Most importantly, we believe we offer “peace of mind” to our participants’ families who know their loved one’s complex needs are cared for. “Friends and family” of participants remain one of our largest referral sources for recruiting new participants.
Our providers “Win” as they are able to focus on improving the lives of their participants. We enable our providers to focus on taking care of participants by providing them with meaningful clinical and administrative support. We remove the pressure of trying to optimize visit volume by rewarding quality, not quantity, of care. We estimate that our providers (1) have a smaller number of participants to care for and spend more time with each participant than providers in similar care organizations, and (2) benefit from the support of a multidisciplinary team.
Government payors “Win” through fiscal certainty and lower costs. We provide fiscal certainty through our capitated payment arrangements and reduce the cost of both medical and long-term support and services for high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Costs under the PACE program are estimated to be 13% lower on average than for a comparable dual-eligible population aged 65 and older under Medicaid, based on an analysis of available data by the National PACE Association in November 2020, and our costs are estimated to be approximately 8% lower on a weighted average basis than costs for comparable fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, based on our analysis of the most recent Dartmouth Atlas data from 2017.
Our Competitive Advantages
We are the leading healthcare delivery platform by number of participants focused on providing all-inclusive, capitated care to high-cost, dual-eligible seniors. Our size and scale confer significant competitive advantages that further differentiate us in the marketplace.
Visionary leadership team with mission-focused culture. The members of our world-class senior leadership team, led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Maureen Hewitt, have considerable years of healthcare experience. Ms. Hewitt and the senior leadership team’s commitment have fostered a mission-focused, participant-centered culture that drives our leading performance in managing frail dual-eligible seniors. In 2016, Ms. Hewitt led the conversion of InnovAge from a not-for-profit entity to a for-profit entity, which allowed us to access the required capital to grow our footprint nationally and reach more participants. Since the for-profit conversion, the number of participants under our care grew 119% from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. In the same period, our total 

8



revenues grew 173%, reflecting a 22% CAGR, and our revenue grew organically at a 15% CAGR, which excludes contribution from acquired centers.
Our robust operating platform. We have standardized and streamlined our operations across markets and have invested meaningfully in the corporate infrastructure needed to drive participant satisfaction, manage healthcare costs and improve clinical outcomes at scale. Because of our scale, we have been able to invest in dedicated, well-staffed teams for all of our corporate and market-level functions. As a result, our physicians can focus on providing care and are not as burdened with additional administrative demands. Our scale also enables us to make large, organization-wide investments in sales and marketing, technology and clinical infrastructure. We leverage established technology solutions to drive improvements in our operations. We have developed robust internal marketing and referral source development capabilities, including significant investments in digital marketing. Our regulatory expertise and de novo development engine differentiate us from other providers. Importantly, we have a robust compliance infrastructure and team. These platform advantages, coupled with our mission-focused culture, give us confidence in our ability to drive growth and bring our participant-centered care model to more frail, dual-eligible seniors.
Our ability to recruit and retain participants. Our ability to recruit and retain participants has resulted in 10% annual, organic census growth over the last four years. Despite our high levels of participant satisfaction, awareness of the PACE model among potential participants and their families has historically remained low. Based on August 2021 information from the National PACE Association and data from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2018, we estimate that approximately 3% of patients who are PACE-eligible are currently enrolled in a PACE program. We continually invest in targeted sales and marketing capabilities to improve awareness of our program among potential eligible participants. We take a multichannel approach to sales and marketing, relying on a mix of traditional provider referral sources in the community as well as leveraging targeted digital marketing. We have realigned our marketing strategy to focus more on digital channels during the COVID-19 pandemic and to reach those searching for senior care alternatives. We are proud of the fact that the friends and family of our participants remain one of our largest referral sources. We believe our average referral conversion rate of 39.1% across all referral sources, calculated using the last two quarters of our fiscal year, is a testament to the value and attractiveness of our model. We experience very low levels of voluntary disenrollment, averaging 5% annually over the last three fiscal years, suggesting participants are highly satisfied with their care.
Access to capital. Although most companies in the broader managed healthcare industry operate as for-profit entities, the vast majority of our direct competitors are not-for-profit entities, which we believe limits their ability to access capital. Federal restrictions on for-profit PACE providers existed until 2015. We believe we are one of only a few for-profit PACE providers in the country and are the largest PACE-focused operator by number of participants. We are an early adopter of the for-profit PACE structure in a market with limited precedents. As a result, we have devoted resources to engaging with our non-profit community partners, some of which are unaccustomed to working with for-profit organizations, to familiarize them with our business model.
As part of our growth-oriented mindset, we have strategically deployed our capital to achieve scale and make the PACE care delivery model accessible to more frail, dual-eligible seniors. We believe our ability to attract investors and access capital will accelerate our growth plans and provides flexibility to simultaneously invest in sales and marketing efforts, de novo centers and strategic acquisitions, all of which will further solidify our leadership position in a fragmented, growing market.
We have a first mover advantage in an industry with high barriers to entry. Our industry has high barriers to entry driven by regulatory complexity, operating model complexity and to the cost associated with opening new locations. Furthermore, state and federal governments typically restrict the number of providers who can operate in a designated market service area, often allowing only a single provider per metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”). We believe this dynamic creates significant first-mover advantages in new markets and ample runway for future growth. We have invested 

9



significant time and resources in partnering with state and federal governments to launch operations in new MSAs. We believe that each new program we build reinforces our competitive position.
We are built to scale nationally. We have proven our ability to execute our model in multiple geographies, as evidenced by the strength of our center-level performance across markets. In all of our markets, our de novo centers opened in the last seven years generated positive Center-level Contribution Margins in fewer than 12 months of operation. This consistent performance highlights the predictability of our model and gives us the conviction to continue investing in building centers, hiring top-tier talent and attracting participants in new markets in order to drive long-term value creation.
We are one of the few providers operating a globally capitated care model. We have a long track record of successfully managing medical risk, driven by the strength of our operational playbook as well as our risk pool. We believe that we have created a repeatable, data-driven playbook to expand our brand and operations across the United States, and we have made substantial investments to support each key component of our approach. The fundamental aspects of our expansion playbook include deep regulatory knowledge, a disciplined approach to site selection, a targeted sales and marketing approach, a concerted effort to recruit and develop talent, scalable underlying clinical technology and an efficient, uniform operating model.
We have invested in multimodal care delivery capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the advantages of our multimodal care delivery capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional channels of care delivery and created barriers to accessing care for many dual-eligible seniors. Our investment in in-home and virtual care capabilities outside of the four walls of our care centers has enabled us to execute on each participant’s care plan without disruption. We believe the adaptability of our model and our ability to effectively engage our participants in numerous ways, without negatively impacting our capitation revenue, differentiates us from other care providers.
Our Growth Strategy 
Increase participant enrollment and capacity within existing centers

● | We have driven 10% annual, organic census growth over the last four years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, our participant census was approximately 6,850 across our 18 centers in five states.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inclusive of our in-progress centers and potential center expansion efforts, our centers are expected to have an average maximum capacity of 900 participants and are expected to be able to serve a total of approximately 19,100 participants, which we believe leaves ample runway to increase the number of participants we serve within our current footprint.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Build de novo centers


● | We have a successful track record of building de novo centers, and currently have new opportunities in our pipeline which we expect to develop and open in the next one to two fiscal years, including opportunities in new states. We believe de novo centers generate compelling long-term unit economics and robust internal rates of return.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have demonstrated the portability of our platform across different geographies and have a prioritized list of target markets that we believe are optimal environments to launch the InnovAge Platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our approach to de novo developments includes building centers to our experience-based specifications, with flexibility for future center expansion factored into the blueprints where possible.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Execute tuck-in acquisitions

● | Over the past three fiscal years, we have acquired and integrated three PACE organizations, expanding into one new state and four new markets through those acquisitions. Over the past fiscal year, we have also been transferred slots and appropriation in one new state.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | By bringing acquired organizations under the InnovAge Platform, we are able to realize significant revenue growth and improve operational efficiency and care delivery post-integration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




● | We believe there is a robust landscape of potential tuck-in acquisitions to supplement our organic growth, and that our known track record for improving and integrating acquired businesses while continuing to prioritize participant care positions us as the acquirer of choice in this market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Reinvest in the InnovAge Platform to optimize performance

● | We believe that our ongoing investment in the InnovAge Platform drives greater efficiency across our business, creating a virtuous cycle that allows us to continue growing. Our platform is the largest among PACE providers and one of the most geographically diverse.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We plan to continually invest in technology improvements and seek to unlock new insights through enhanced data analytics capabilities that will advance our care model.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe our investments will ultimately result in better health outcomes and lower medical costs for participants. As we continue to reduce medical costs, we expect to generate incremental savings that can be reinvested to support continuous improvement of the InnovAge Platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Regulation
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, arrangement and provision of covered health care services to our participants, operation and management of PACE centers, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs. If any of our operations are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:
​

● | suspension, termination or exclusion of our participation in government payor programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​loss of our licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer prescription drugs in the states in which we operate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​

●changes in and reinterpretation of rules and laws by a regulatory agency or court, such as state corporate practice of medicine laws, that could affect the structure and management of our business;
●​negative adjustments to government payment models including, but not limited to, Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid; and
●​

11



●harm to our reputation, which could negatively impact our business relationships, the terms of government payor contracts, our ability to attract and retain participants and physicians, our ability to obtain financing and our access to new business opportunities, among other things.
​
​
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies with whom we contract at any time in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “​Risks Related to Regulation.”
​
Federal and State Regulation of PACE Providers
​
We are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws, regulations, and guidance, including legal requirements directly applicable to PACE providers as well as Medicare and Medicaid laws and regulations. These laws and guidances relate to our organizational structure, governance, fiscal soundness, marketing activities, participant enrollment and disenrollment, charges to participants, provision of healthcare and other services to participants, care planning activities, service delivery settings and maintenance of centers, participant rights, employment and contractual arrangements with health care providers and other staff, quality assessment and performance improvement activities, participant grievances and appeals, medical records documentation, compliance program activities, and other aspects of our operations and financing. As a PACE provider that provides qualified prescription drug coverage, we are also subject to requirements applicable to Medicare Part D plan sponsors.
​
As a PACE provider, we and our centers are subject to audits by CMS and state agencies, which have in the past or may in the future result in the identification of deficiencies in connection with our compliance with regulatory requirements, participant quality of care, care plan development and implementation, grievance and appeal processes, clinicians acting outside of their scope of practice, and other issues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “​Risks Related to Regulation” for a description of certain current audits. We expect these audits to continue in the future. In addition to risks associated with audits of our current centers, we also face risks associated with new centers that we may acquire in the future, which may not have developed the same compliance and quality infrastructure that we currently have in place. Issues identified through these audits can result in corrective action plans, civil monetary penalties, enrollment suspensions, and other financial penalties and enforcement actions, in addition to loss of our contracts with CMS and state agencies.
​
The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to PACE providers are complex and subject to change, making it necessary for us to invest significant resources in complying with these requirements. Scrutiny through federal and state government audits, oversight and enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. CMS and state regulatory authorities regularly audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS’s regulations and our contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our participants. Whether identified through these audits or other avenues, our failure to comply with the federal and state laws applicable to our business may result in significant or material retroactive adjustments to and/or withholding of capitation payments, fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, requirements to make significant changes to our operations, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs), loss of contracts, or cessation of our services.
​
Licensing Laws
​
We, our healthcare professionals, and our centers are subject to various state and local licensure and certification requirements in connection with our provision of health care and other services. Specifically, in some of the states in which we operate, we are required to maintain licensure or certification as an adult day health center, home health or home care provider, diagnostic and treatment center, pharmacy provider, clinical laboratory and/or other type of facility, and our employed physicians and other clinicians also must be licensed or certified, as applicable, in the states in which they are providing services. We, our healthcare professionals and our centers are also subject to a variety of other state laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, the quality of medical care, equipment, privacy of health information, physician relationships, personnel and operating policies and procedures. In addition 

12



to state requirements, we and/or our healthcare professionals are in some cases subject to federal licensing and certification requirements, such as certification or waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 for performing limited laboratory testing and Drug Enforcement Administration registration for writing prescriptions for controlled substances. In addition, certain of the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls and other similar matters. While the states in which we operate do not currently impose these regulations on entities solely bearing risk under the PACE program, these states or states that we expand into may in the future seek to license or otherwise regulate our operations and financial solvency.
​
Failure to comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws, regulations and standards could result in a variety of consequences, including cessation of our services, loss of our contracts, prior payments by payors being subject to recoupment, requirements to make significant changes to our operations, or civil or criminal penalties. We routinely take the steps we believe are necessary to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities. While we endeavor to comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex, changing and often subject to varying interpretations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the statutes that pertain to the employment of health care practitioners by health care facilities do not explicitly include a PACE organization in the list of health care facilities by which a health care practitioner may be employed. Any failure to satisfy applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
​
Corporate Practice of Medicine
​
The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state, and some states in which we operate prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. In certain states, we currently contract with physicians to provide healthcare services that are required to be provided by licensed physicians. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, other parties may assert that we could be engaged in the corporate practice of medicine. Were such allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and we may be required to restructure our contractual arrangements.

The consequences associated with violating corporate practice of medicine laws vary by state and may result in physicians being subject to disciplinary action, as well as forfeiture of revenues from government payors for services rendered. For lay entities, violations may also bring both civil and, in more extreme cases, criminal liability for engaging in medical practice without a license. Some of the relevant laws, regulations and agency interpretations in states with corporate practice of medicine restrictions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. In limited cases, courts have required companies to divest or reorganize structures deemed to violate corporate practice restrictions. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Any allegations or findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business—Laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require a restructuring of our business.”
​
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
​

13



Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the provider from future participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years in the case of criminal conviction. Civil penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include up to $104,330 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and potential exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the statute as amended, the defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor do not violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
​
We enter into several arrangements that could potentially implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute if the requisite intent were present, such as:
​
●Joint Ventures.   To prove the concept of our ability to work with not-for-profits, we operate one of our centers under a joint venture with a not-for-profit healthcare provider. Although we do not expressly seek to enter into new joint ventures, it is possible that the government payor landscape in certain markets we may attempt to enter in the future may make entering into additional joint ventures attractive. Investment interests in the joint venture may not fully satisfy a safe harbor. Although failure to comply with a safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, an arrangement that does not operate within a safe harbor may be subject to increased scrutiny and the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of HHS has warned health care entities in the past that certain joint venture relationships have a potential for abuse. Joint ventures that fall outside the safe harbors are evaluated on a case-by-case basis under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In this regard, we have endeavored to structure our joint venture to satisfy as many elements of the applicable safe harbor for investments in small entities as we believe are commercially reasonable. For example, we believe that these investments are offered and made by us on a fair market value basis and provide returns to the investors in proportion to their actual investment in the venture.
​
●Discounts.   Our centers sometimes acquire certain items and services at a discount that may be reimbursed by a federal healthcare program. We endeavor to structure our vendor contracts that include discount or rebate provisions to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for discounts.
​
​
●Sales Forces and Participant Recruitment.   We employ our own sales force and attempt to meet the Anti-Kickback safe harbor for bona fide employment.
​
​
If any of our business transactions or arrangements, including those described above, were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare 

14



programs and FCA liability. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
​
As part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, OIG issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. Specifically, OIG sought to identify ways in which it might modify or add new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute (as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducements provision of the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute) in order to foster arrangements that promote care coordination and advance the delivery of value-based care, while also protecting against harms caused by fraud and abuse. OIG issued final rules effective January 19, 2021, that modify existing safe harbors and create new safe harbors and exceptions that may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. However, it remains unclear how these final rules will be interpreted and implemented.
​
Federal Self-Referral Prohibition
​
The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act (“Stark Law”) generally prohibits a physician who has (or whose immediate family member has) a financial relationship with a provider from making referrals to that “entity” for “designated health services” if payment for the services may be made under Medicare or Medicaid. “Designated health services” include clinical laboratory services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical and occupational therapy services, outpatient speech-language pathology services, certain radiology services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients equipment and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services and outpatient prescription drugs. If our operations ever result in us being included within the definition of an “entity” under the Stark Law, then any financial relationships that we have with a referring provider would be prohibited unless a statutory or regulatory exception is available.
​
Providers are prohibited from filing Medicare claims for services related to a prohibited referral and a provider that has billed for prohibited services is obligated to notify and refund the amounts collected from the Medicare program or to make a self-disclosure to CMS under its Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol. Penalties for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment, recoupment, refunds of amounts paid in violation of the law, exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and substantial civil monetary penalties ($25,820 per prohibited item or service and $172,137 if there is a circumvention scheme; penalty amounts reflect current 2021 levels and are adjusted for inflation from time to time). Claims filed in violation of the Stark Law may be deemed false claims under the FCA. In addition to the Stark Law, various states in which we operate have adopted their own self-referral prohibition statutes.
​
The False Claims Act
​
Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
​
●knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, which may relate to our records or reports necessary to generate appropriate RAF determinations;
​
●knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
​
●knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record, report or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or
​
●conspires to commit the above acts.
​
​

15



The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes. The ACA provides that claims for payment that are tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (which could include, for example, illegal incentives or remuneration in exchange for enrollment or referrals) are false for purposes of the FCA. In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments from government payors. This could be relevant to the extent we received improper payments on account of RAF determinations that are based on improper or erroneous records or reports. Failure to return overpayments could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute.
​
The penalties for a violation of the FCA may include per claim penalties, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. The Department of Justice has adjusted the per claim penalty range from $11,665 to $23,331 for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, if the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.
 
In addition to civil enforcement under the FCA, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
In addition to the FCA, the various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to capitated government-sponsored healthcare programs, such as Medicaid managed care and PACE.
​
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
​
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
​
●presenting, or causing to be presented, claims, reports or records relating to payment by Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as reported, is false or fraudulent or was presented for a physician’s service by a person who knows or should know that the individual providing the service is not a licensed physician, obtained licensure through misrepresentation or represented certification in a medical specialty without in fact possessing such certification;
●​
●offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider;
●​
●arranging contracts with or making payments to an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal health care programs or included on CMS’s preclusion list;
●​
●violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
●​
●making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal health care program;
●​
●making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal health care program; and
●​
●failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government.
​

16



​
We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute would apply. We perform monthly checks on our employees and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs or otherwise ineligible for payment. We have also implemented processes to ensure that we do not make payments to contracted or noncontracted providers listed on CMS’s preclusion list nor make payments for drugs prescribed by individuals on the preclusion list. However, should an individual or entity be excluded, on the preclusion list, or otherwise ineligible for payment and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to such individual or entity. Due to this area of risk and the possibility of other allegations being brought against us, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we could face allegations of noncompliance with the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute that have the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
Privacy and Security
​
The federal regulations promulgated under the authority of HIPAA require us to provide certain protections to our participants and their health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of PHI and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and their business associates, to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide our participants with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
​
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In instances where we act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond our status as a covered entity.
​
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless an exception to the definition of breach applies or the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.
​
Violations of HIPAA by providers like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $50,000 (not adjusted for inflation) per violation and up to $1.5 million (not adjusted for inflation) per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.
​
In addition to HIPAA, we may be subject to other laws governing the privacy and security of data, such as the CCPA and data breach notification laws.

Healthcare Reform Efforts
​
The U.S. federal and state governments continue to enact and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that have had a material impact on or could materially impact various aspects of the healthcare system and our business, operating results and/or cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary shortfalls and constraints pose potential risks for our revenue streams. We cannot predict how government payors or health care consumers might react to federal and state healthcare legislation and regulation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future, nor can we predict what form many of these regulations will take before implementation. Some examples of legislative and regulatory changes impacting our business include:
​
●In March 2010, broad healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the ACA. There have since been numerous political and legal efforts to repeal, replace or modify the ACA, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the law. Although many of the provisions of the ACA did not take effect immediately and continue to be implemented, and some have been and may be modified before or during their implementation, the reforms could continue to have an impact on our business in a number of ways. Provisions of the ACA that impact the Medicare and Medicaid programs, in particular, may have an impact on our business. These and other provisions of the ACA remain subject to ongoing uncertainty due to developing regulations as well as continuing political and legal challenges at both the federal and state levels.
​
●There have in recent years been congressional efforts to move Medicaid from an open-ended program with coverage and benefits set by the federal government to one in which states receive a fixed amount of federal funds, either through block grants or per capita caps, and have more flexibility to determine benefits, eligibility or provider payments. If these types of changes are implemented in the future, we cannot predict whether the amount of fixed federal funding to the states will be based on current payment amounts, or if it will be based on lower payment amounts, which would negatively impact those states that expanded their Medicaid programs in response to the ACA.
​
●Legislation enacted in 2011 requires CMS to sequester or reduce all Medicare payments, including payments to PACE organizations, by two percent per year for a period of years. Subsequent legislation extended these cuts through 2030, but legislation enacted in 2020 suspended the cuts during the pandemic.  Currently, the 2% cuts under sequestration are scheduled to be reinstated in 2022, which, once reinstated, will negatively impact our revenue.
​
​
​
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. Specifically, changes in Medicare and Medicaid could lower PACE rates or increase our expenses. Any failure to successfully implement strategic initiatives that respond to future legislative, regulatory, and executive changes could have a material adverse effect on government-sponsored PACE programs, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
​
CMS and state Medicaid agencies also routinely adjust the RAF which is central to payment under PACE and Managed Medicaid programs in which we participate. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that we manage in our population are subject to change by CMS and state agencies. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Risks Related to Our Business — Our records and submissions to government payors may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of participants, which could cause us to overstate or understate our revenue and subject us to payment obligations or penalties.”
​
Other Regulations
​
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all 

18



healthcare facilities, including our community centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.

Federal and state law also governs the dispensing of controlled substances by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Physicians are required to report relationships they have with the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologics through the Open Payments Program database. Any allegations or findings that we or our providers have violated any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain states in which we do business or may desire to do business in the future have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or expansion of healthcare facilities, including our community centers. These regulations can be complex and time-consuming. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Impact of COVID-19
The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world and throughout the United States has altered the behavior of businesses and people, with significant negative effects on federal, state and local economies, the duration of which is unknown at this time. The virus has and continues to disproportionately impact older adults, especially those with chronic illnesses, which describes our participants. To date, we have experienced or expect to experience the following impacts on our business model due to COVID-19.
Care Model. Though the COVID-19 pandemic altered the mix of settings where we deliver care, our multimodal model ensured that our participants continued to receive the care they needed. We closed all our centers in March 2020 and transitioned to a 100% in-home and virtual care model that allowed for seamless delivery of care while increasing participant visit volume and maintaining continuity of care. Our telehealth solution received high satisfaction among participants, caregivers and IDTs. In February 2021, as the prevalence of COVID-19 decreased in the communities we serve, we began re-opening our centers using a phased approach to ensure the safety of both our staff and participants. In addition, community assisted living and skilled nursing facilities began to open to allow in-person visits by all members of our IDT. By June 2021, we fully opened all our centers and transitioned to a predominantly in-person, center-based care model, supplemented by telehealth. We expect telehealth care delivery to remain a part of our ongoing care model.
Growth. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of March 2020, we pivoted to a virtual enrollment model due to safety concerns for our employees and participants and to comply with local government ordinances. We also realigned our marketing strategy to increase our focus on digital channels during the COVID-19 pandemic and to reach those searching for senior care alternatives. During our fiscal fourth quarter, as we continue to recover from the pandemic, enrollment growth continued to improve and has returned to pre-COVID levels. We continue to build on our media strategy targeting lower funnel media tactics that have built a strong pipeline of digital leads for enrollment.
Revenue. Our revenue is capitated and not determined by the number of times we interact with our participants face-to-face. As of June 30, 2021, we had not experienced a decline in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The capitation payments we receive from Medicare are risk-adjusted based on documented encounters and diagnosed conditions. Government payors require that participants’ health issues be documented annually regardless of the permanence of the underlying causes. Historically, this documentation has been required to be completed during an in-person visit with a participant, but due to COVID-19 and going forward, CMS is now allowing documentation of conditions identified during qualifying telehealth visits with participants. Thus far, we have been able to document the health conditions of our participants during telehealth visits as well as we did during in-person visits prior to COVID-19; however, any issues with documenting such conditions could adversely impact Medicare RAF scores and our resulting revenue for future periods.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into legislation. The CARES Act, in addition to other provisions, provided for the temporary suspension of the automatic 2% 

19



reduction of Medicare claim reimbursements (sequestration) for the period of May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, which positively impacted our revenue during the year ended June 30, 2021.
Expenses. For the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, on a PMPM basis, our internal care delivery costs decreased, while our external provider costs increased, as further described in Results of Operations, in part due to the impact of COVID-19 on our care delivery costs as we executed our participants’ care plans through a different mix of care settings. On a PMPM basis, we did not experience material changes in our aggregate participant-related care expenses
The United States continues to experience supply chain issues with respect to personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and other medical supplies used to prevent transmission of COVID-19. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we acquired significantly greater quantities of medical supplies at significantly higher prices than pre-pandemic rates to ensure the safety of our employees and our participants. Costs related to PPE medical supplies represented approximately 0.6% and 2.1% of our total cost of care for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. While the price of PPE may remain higher than historical levels for the foreseeable future, we do not expect these incremental costs to be material as a percentage of our total expenses.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Although we own trademarks and service marks such as “InnovAge,” which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of us or our subsidiaries, we do not currently believe our intellectual property is material to our business. 
Competition
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of healthcare for participants and clinical providers. We also compete with payors and other alternate managed care programs for participants. Of these providers, there are many other companies and individuals currently providing healthcare services, many of which have been in business longer and/or have substantially more resources. Given the regulatory environment, there may be high barriers to entry for PACE providers; however, since there are relatively modest capital expenditures required for providing healthcare services, there are less substantial financial barriers to entry in the healthcare industry generally. Other companies could enter the healthcare industry in the future and divert some or all of our business. Our principal competitors for dual-eligible seniors vary considerably in type and identity by market. Our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to penetrate existing markets, successfully expand into new markets, recruit qualified physicians or if we experience significant participant attrition to our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The healthcare industry is highly competitive.”
We believe the principal competitive factors for serving adults dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who meet nursing home eligibility criteria include: participant experience, quality of care, health outcomes, total cost of care, brand identity and trust in that brand. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
Seasonality
Our business experiences some variability depending upon the time of year. Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-participant medical costs in our second and third quarters. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period, and shorter periods will have lower medical costs. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if a period in one year has a different number of business days compared to the same period in another. We also expect medical costs to be impacted by a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in increased or decreased total medical costs depending upon the severity of the infection, the duration of the infection and the availability of healthcare services for our participants.

20



In addition, the retrospective capitation payments we receive for each participant are determined by a participant’s RAF score, which is calculated twice per year and is based on the evolving acuity and chronic conditions of a participant. We estimate and accrue for the expected true-up payments of our participants. Though no assurances can be made in the future, we have historically used our best estimate for accruing for this payment, and we received net positive true-up payments during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Historically, these true-up payments typically occur between May and August, but the timing of these payments is determined by CMS, and we have neither visibility nor control over the timing of such payments.
Human Capital Resources
InnovAge is a mission-driven organization, focused on providing its participants with improved quality of care and allowing them to live in their homes for as long as safely possible, all while reducing the overutilization of our hospitals and nursing homes. In terms of diversity, our senior management team strives to be a reflection of the communities it serves. Our employees drive our mission and share core values, many of whom have cared for an aging relative, that both stem from and define our culture and which plays a critical role in our execution at all levels in our organization. Our values are used in candidate screening and in employee evaluations to help reinforce their importance in our organization. As of June 30, 2021, our voluntary retention rate for employees was 75.9%. Additionally, in our annual employee engagement survey conducted in 2020, 68% of our employees responding agreed that they would recommend InnovAge as a great place to work.
As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,800 employees, including 1,200 clinical professionals. This count excludes contractors. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Implications of being an emerging growth company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We will be deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” at such time that we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) for a period of at least 12 months and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act.
An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements, plus unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for any interim period and related discussion in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the longer phase-in periods 

21



for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods permitted under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.
