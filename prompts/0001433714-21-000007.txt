Item 1. Business
Overview
Castlight Health, Inc. (“Castlight”, “the Company” or “we”) provides health navigation solutions for large U.S. employers and health plans (“customers”) and their respective employees and members (“users”). Castlight’s offerings help individuals connect and engage with the right provider, benefit, or virtual care solution, at the right time, leveraging a combination of sophisticated technology and an expert team. Castlight’s navigation offerings have demonstrated measurable results, driving high engagement and user satisfaction, increased program utilization, steerage to the right care and provider, and lower healthcare costs for our customers and millions of users. 
The foundation of Castlight’s solutions is our proprietary software-as-a-service ("SaaS") platform, which delivers a digital user experience and enables our high-touch services. We believe our platform is unique in its: 
• Breadth and depth of data and partner integrations across the healthcare ecosystem; 
• Ability to engage a user through digital self-service (mobile app, web) and human-powered modes (telephonic, chat), which are supported by the same underlying technology for a consistent, fluid experience;
• Personalization engine that leverages data from these integrations and user inputs to customize each user experience and guide users to the right benefits and providers;
• Comprehensive engagement across a user’s health, wellbeing, and condition management needs; and
• Broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, which facilitates streamlined procurement and management of a pre-vetted set of condition and wellbeing programs with turnkey integration.
Our platform’s services-oriented architecture enables us to extend our technology for use beyond our own applications. This enables us to serve health plans and other customers seeking to leverage our technology within their own member-facing applications or user touch points, including through white-labeling for our health plan customers. 
We sell our platform as a suite of branded and white-labeled digital health navigation applications to large U.S. employers and health plans. We also sell product offerings through partnerships with large benefits consultants and health plans, with a focus on serving large U.S. employers. 
In July 2019, we expanded our strategy to include health plans as potential customers and to package our product offerings to support user experiences beyond those we offered through our Castlight-powered websites and applications. In addition, we expanded our offerings to incorporate high-touch, human support, enabled by our technology platform, in addition to the mobile and web experience for users, which we call Castlight Care Guides.
Since this strategic expansion, we demonstrated proof points for our expanded strategy, including:
• In October 2019, we announced an enterprise license agreement with Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”), the largest for-profit managed health care company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, that provides Anthem with access to key components of our platform and expands Engage, a white-labeled version of our digital solutions. 
•In July 2020, we entered into an agreement with Cigna Corporation (“Cigna”), a global health services company, to support a portion of Cigna’s Taft-Hartley and Federal Business segment with our healthcare navigation technology. 
• In the third quarter of 2020, our Castlight Care Guides offering became generally available as a supplemental service for our customers. From Castlight’s launch, we have offered users both digital applications and telephonic support. In parallel with the roadmap for our digital platform, we have invested in and expanded our phone-based support services. Care Guides are trained to offer administrative and clinical support, and will help our users navigate their health-options using Castlight’s core technology. We believe Castlight Care Guides, as an expanded phone- and chat-based support service, will generate incremental user engagement and healthcare cost savings for our customers and users over time.
•In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (“BCBSAL”), a regional Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee, to offer a complete health navigation solution for BCBSAL's largest employer clients. This agreement represents a third health plan partnership, and we believe it validates our health plan growth strategy. 
Corporate Information. Castlight was incorporated in the State of Delaware in January 2008. Our Class B common stock began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2014 under the trading symbol “CSLT.” Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California, and our Customer Center of Excellence is located in Sandy, Utah. 
The U.S. Healthcare Industry and Our Opportunity
We believe Castlight has a significant opportunity to help existing and prospective customers and users navigate the major economic and social challenges associated with the U.S. healthcare system and benefit from the growing market for high-tech and high-touch navigation services. We see the following industry trends affecting employers, health plans and individual users as potential long-term growth drivers for our business.
Large Employers. Our historical focus has been on large employers of the U.S. healthcare market. We continue to see significant opportunities within this customer category.
Employers play a significant role in U.S. healthcare benefits spending. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), employer-sponsored private health insurance totaled $1.1 trillion in 2019, up 4.3% year-over-year. More than half of this amount was from private employer contributions to health insurance premiums. CMS forecasted these expenditures to grow at an average annual growth rate of 4.6% from 2018 to 2028. 
Nevertheless, employees continue to struggle to understand and utilize their benefits, limiting the effectiveness of employer cost and quality initiatives. Studies continue to demonstrate significant underutilization of such benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic expanded employee needs, as almost half of employees skipped care, 45% of employees experienced behavioral health needs, and a majority of employees with chronic conditions delayed important care.
Based on these trends, large employers are increasingly interested in navigation technologies and services such as ours, to increase employee engagement, lower costs and improve outcomes. The Business Group on Health ("BGH") published a survey in August 2020 that listed its large employer members’ top healthcare initiatives for 2021, which include: 
•Implementing more virtual care solutions;
•Expanding access to mental health services;
•Deploying a more focused strategy on high-cost claims;
•Expanding “centers of excellence” — programs with concentrated expertise in a particular medical area — to include more conditions to lower costs; and
•Implementing high performance networks.
We believe Castlight has a key role to play in helping large U.S. employers and their employees address their respective health benefit challenges through personalized health navigation solutions, especially as large employers continue to respond to the changing healthcare landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Health Plans. Given the scalability and demonstrated medical cost savings of our platform, we also believe there is a significant market opportunity for us to offer our platform to health plans. Overall U.S. healthcare spending is projected to continue to grow each year for the foreseeable future. CMS estimates that U.S. national health expenditures totaled $3.8 trillion in 2019, an increase of 4.5% year-over-year. CMS expects national health expenditures to increase at an average annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2018 to 2028, totaling approximately $6.2 trillion in 2028. CMS estimates that U.S. national health expenditures were approximately 17.8% of gross domestic product in 2019 and are projected to increase to 19.7% in 2028. This is significantly higher than most other developed nations. 
However, there is little evidence that these massive U.S. healthcare outlays are efficient or result in better outcomes for Americans. Research published in the October 2019 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that waste comprises approximately 25% of U.S. healthcare spending across categories, including failure of care delivery and coordination, over-treatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse and administrative complexity.
In addition to the large spending and inadequate value for health plans, potential regulatory changes and demographic shifts also impact health plans and introduce demand for our services:
• In October 2020, CMS issued a final rule to increase price transparency among group health plans and health insurance issuers, requiring plans make available personalized, out-of-pocket healthcare costs in a self-service, internet-based tool, by January 1, 2023. We believe health plans may seek support from third-party services like ourselves in delivering the self-service tool required under this rule. 
• Medicare Advantage (“MA”) enrollment continues to grow across both the Individual and Group MA markets. According to research conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, approximately 24 million enrollees in 2020 were on an individual MA plan -- or 39% of the 62 million Medicare beneficiaries -- up from 24% of total Medicare enrollees in 2010. 
Based on these industry dynamics, we believe there is a significant opportunity for us to leverage our platform to help health plans manage healthcare costs through our digital and high tech solutions. 
Market Opportunity. We consider the potential users of our products to be all individuals who receive health coverage through their employer or a commercial health plan. This includes individuals with employer-sponsored coverage, individuals purchasing coverage directly from a health plan or on an exchange, and individuals participating in Medicare Advantage or Managed Medicaid programs administered by a commercial health plan. Based on the potential fee opportunity for our current products, we estimate our total addressable market, including our digital navigation offering and Care Guides, is approximately $18 billion. 
Our Solution
We have developed a comprehensive health navigation platform powered by a set of associated services and technologies that match individuals to the best care and programs available to them, and motivate them to take action, using both technology and human support. This, in turn, helps customers manage their benefits more effectively, and generate more value from their benefits investments. Our health navigation platform powers all of our products with the following key components:
Breadth and Depth of Data Integrations. Our platform drives user engagement, program utilization, and medical cost savings through its ability to ingest data across the entire healthcare ecosystem – from insurance carriers and employer eligibility files to third-party digital health point solutions and activity trackers – and utilize it to personalize each user's 
experience. Further, the platform is designed to deliver these services in compliance with healthcare privacy and other applicable regulations.
The foundation of our platform is this breadth and depth of our data integrations, which, in aggregate, include more than three billion records. These integrations include:
• Claims data across more than 30 medical payers and more than 30 additional providers spanning pharmacy benefit managers, dental payers, and behavioral/employee assistance programs;
• 100+ employer eligibility file vendors;
• 150+ distinct single-sign on integrations with benefit programs; and 
• 100+ distinct API integrations with digital health point solutions.
Our platform also accesses and integrates data from additional sources, such as user searches, user-stated health goals, third-party provider quality sources, biometric data, Health Risk Assessment data, activity trackers, and third-party digital health programs.
Castlight Genius Personalization Engine. Powered by our data asset, Genius leverages machine-learning models to guide employees to the right available care, benefit program, or content based on their individual health needs. Genius works as follows:
• Genius uses our data sets to score our user population across clinical and wellbeing categories;
• Genius then applies machine learning models to prioritize and segment users into 100+ different targeting segments; and 
• Based on this segmentation and demographic data, Genius sends personalized educational content and recommendations to users. User outreach is delivered through channels such as email, mobile push notifications, and in-app and website.
Third-Party Digital Health Ecosystem Program Integrations. We leverage our open architecture to simplify third-party integration and management, remove user friction in accessing external programs, and increase engagement with these additional resources. Our platform integrates with nearly any vendor, and it has the flexibility to support multiple integration models, for instance: single sign-on and contextual promotions; incentives for micro-behaviors using bidirectional data feeds; communication and chat; and an embedded experience with user intake data sharing. We use data and our artificial intelligence/machine learning to deliver personalized recommendations that match each user to the right program, at the right time. This approach to integrations creates one seamless benefits experience for users across categories such as: activity tracking, biometric screening, financial wellness, health risk assessment, mental health and fitness, nutrition management, physical and behavioral health, resilience, second opinion, sleep management, weight coaching, and management of various specific conditions (e.g., heart health, diabetes, holistic wellbeing, maternal health, and medical decision support). 
Cost Transparency and Provider Quality Score. Our proprietary provider quality score (“Q-Score”) enhances our ability to recommend providers based on clinical quality, in addition to user-specific out-of-pocket cost estimates for healthcare services. Q-Score combines baseline provider metrics (years of experience, medical school degrees and board certifications) and third-party hospital and provider quality metrics with internally-derived outcomes metrics based on our analysis of our wealth of historical claims data. Based on these data inputs and our own proprietary algorithms, our platform is able to generate a Q-Score for more than 94% of U.S. practitioners. 
Behavioral Health. Our behavioral health ("BH") offering addresses key barriers our users face navigating behavioral health needs:
•Awareness: Our Genius personalization engine identifies users with a BH condition and those who are at high-risk of a BH condition but have not yet been diagnosed. We use omni-channel outreach to inform users about relevant benefits programs. 
•Access: We provide immediate access to digital tools such as resilience programs, computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, telepsychology providers. For many patients, primary care physicians with BH expertise can provide motivational interviewing and medication support.
•Cost: We help users understand free and low-cost offerings such as employee assistance programs and employer-sponsored tools. For users who need care from a provider, we navigate them to cost-effective, in-network providers.
Unified Reporting Platform. We provide a unified reporting platform where our customers can find aggregated data on engagement with the Castlight platform and with their integrated third-party solutions. This information refreshes daily. Our 
customers can view data segmented by population sub-groups, equipping them with insights to drive strategic decision making. Reporting includes overall engagement with the platform, programs, incentives and challenges.
Measurable Value. Since launching Castlight Complete ("Complete") in September 2018, we have demonstrated Complete’s ability to drive measurable value across three core areas: (i) user engagement; (ii) user behavior change; and (iii) medical cost savings that translate into a return on investment (“ROI”) on a customer’s Complete subscription costs. For example:
• User Engagement 
 ◦ Registration and Return Rates: Complete drove a 64% subscriber registration rate and a 35% monthly user return rate over the course of 2020.
◦ Employee Experience: The Castlight Complete mobile app generated a Net Promoter Score of 65 in 2020. In addition, the Castlight app's Apple App Store rating was 4.7 stars with more than 36,000 reviews as of January 2021. 
•User Behavior Change:
◦High-value provider: Employees using Complete received care in an emergency room 6% less often than non-users after being directed to more appropriate care options. Additionally, Complete has reduced medical spending, including approximately 12% reduction in labs and imaging costs for those who search for care within the Castlight platform. 
◦Appropriate care: 29% of registered Castlight users had a preventive office visit over the year compared with only 16% of non-users. 
◦Program utilization: Complete achieved 1.4 to 2.5 times higher engagement in employer-offered health and wellness solutions that are integrated into the Complete platform.

•Medical Cost Savings
◦In the latest reporting period available, representing claims incurred through the end of 2019, Complete customers typically achieved 1.55% savings on their medical claims expense, representing an ROI of 2-3 times for a typical customer. 
Our Products
For Large Employers: We offer our platform through packages that we sell through our direct sales force:
Care Guidance Navigator: Our Care Guidance Navigator empowers users to make better care decisions and navigate their employer-sponsored healthcare benefit programs through an experience tailored specifically for a user’s networks, health plans, care options, and programs, including virtual care and program options. By helping individuals choose the right available benefit and right care option at the right time, Care Guidance Navigator seeks to improve user satisfaction with benefits while helping employers achieve medical costs savings. Care Guidance Navigator can be implemented with Care Guides for an approach that combines world class technology with our expert team.
Wellbeing Navigator: Our personalized, incentivized Wellbeing Navigator helps drive engagement across an employer’s entire benefits program. Wellbeing Navigator leverages a robust data set, advanced personalization, incentives, challenges, and community features to help drive engagement, improve health and increase employee satisfaction. Wellbeing Navigator is often deployed in both US and global employee populations. 
Complete Health Navigator: Complete Health Navigator (“Complete” or “Castlight Complete”) combines the full functionality of the Wellbeing Navigator and Care Guidance Navigator packages in one unified user experience. Complete addresses the unique needs of an organization and guides users through their entire health journey. Complete delivers personalized content and communications, whether users are working to stay healthy or managing a condition. Complete Health Navigator can be implemented with Care Guides for an approach that combines world class technology with our expert team.
Castlight Care Guides: In October 2019, we announced the creation of a high-touch navigation service to complement our digital navigation offerings. Castlight Care Guides combines Castlight’s personalized health navigation technology with a high-touch service to help navigate users to the best care for them. Examples include Care Guide support to assist users searching for care, understanding their benefits, challenging healthcare bills, or navigating a clinical need. With the addition of Castlight Care Guides, an employer can deploy both digital and high-touch navigation solutions and will no longer be limited to choose between the two options. Our Care Guide capability expands on our existing user support capabilities and is based in 
our Utah Customer Center of Excellence. We opened our Sandy, Utah facility in March 2020, made this solution broadly available in the third quarter of 2020, and have multiple customers utilizing the product as of the fourth quarter of 2020.
All of the Navigator packages described above include ecosystem integrations, the Castlight Genius personalization engine, and an engagement hub that aggregates all employee benefits, personalized recommendations and communications into one central location. In addition, all of our packages include end user support to ensure effective use of the platform and support technical issue resolution. Fees for the end user support services are included as part of our subscription contracts.
For Health Plans:
White-Labeled Health Navigation Solutions: For health plans seeking to amplify their value and improve the member experience with a technology partner, we offer white-labeled digital health navigation solutions. We collaborate with health plans to provide solutions that meet their priorities, focused on their core market needs: the digital front door that helps simplify the member experience; personalized, proactive guidance to connect members to the right care and programs; engagement in the health plan’s assets; data management and integration; and market innovation. 
For example, we power the Engage offering that Anthem deploys to its Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans in the United States. Engage delivers the personalized user experience of our platform to Anthem members with additional features available through deep integrations with Anthem’s own assets, such as the Anthem Health Guide concierge, Anthem’s clinical and care management programs, and Anthem’s gaps-in-care and clinical analytics. Engage is offered in multiple packages, including a more streamlined version that can be offered by Anthem to its smaller size clients. Engage is available to Anthem's national accounts and large group accounts.
Embedded Platform Technology Services: For health plans seeking core technology to power their own digital experience, we offer access to our core set of APIs. For example, as part of our agreement with Anthem, we provide Anthem with a non-exclusive license for some of our underlying health navigation platform technology services, such as transparency and personalization. We offer our platform’s underlying technology services to other health plans seeking to embed our platform functionality into their existing user experiences instead of offering a full white-labeled solution.
Our Services
We provide services to help employers implement and maximize the value of our offering, including:
Implementation Services. We provide implementation services to our customers to help ensure successful deployment of our offering, including executing required data feeds, loading customer data, configuring products, integrating with third-party and other applications, communication and comprehensive testing. Fees for these services are included as part of our contracts.
Marketplace: Rewards Center. To help employers drive employee engagement with their benefits, we power a Rewards Center where employees can redeem incentive points for items such as contributions to their HSA accounts, gift cards, and donations to charity. Revenues from products sold through our online marketplace are recognized on a net basis primarily because we act as an agent in these contracts.
COVID-19 Response
As an organization providing health navigation solutions, we have used our core technology and newly developed functionality to support our customers and the community through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For our customers, this support included:
•A COVID-19 resource center, providing education and communication of healthcare coverage;
•Expanded Behavioral Health product support, given the mental health burden on employees during the pandemic;
•Customer-specific analytics to identify and communicate with populations vulnerable to COVID-19;
•Complementary access to certain ecosystem resources;
•Expanded community Flu Shot Finders, given limited on-site flu shots for employers; 
•Working Well return-to-workplace solution and Working Well for Higher Education solution, enabling customers to offer easy, daily symptom tracking and self-attestation to ensure safe workplace re-entry and campus openings, respectively; and
•COVID-19 Vaccine Navigation services, including vaccine educational information, eligibility information, and guidance to nearby or available vaccination locations. 
For our community, this support included:
•Comprehensive COVID-19 Test-site Finder, a directory of testing sites available to the public which launched in March 2020, updated and expanded throughout the pandemic. The Test Site finder is available to the community at no charge and is being used to power well-known public resources nationwide, including Google Maps and state health departments;
•Analytics around the cost of care and deferred care during the COVID-19 pandemic, including analysis on deferred immunizations published in the Journal of the American Medical Association; and 
•Research on the equity of access to test sites, including research published in partnership with ABC News’ FiveThirtyEight.
Customers
Our customers consist primarily of large self-insured employers and health plans, representing a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing, retail, technology and government, and include some of the largest employers and health plans in the United States. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or health plan, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, which has entered into a master subscription agreement with us to access our platform, including customers that are in the process of deploying our platform to their users.
In October 2019, we entered into a 30-month enterprise license agreement with Anthem, effective January 1, 2020, that extends and expands our existing relationship first announced in 2015. The agreement includes our core care guidance technology, the Engage health navigation platform, and a new, non-exclusive license for some of our underlying health navigation platform technology services, such as transparency and personalization. With the 2019 agreement, Anthem moved from a channel partner for the Engage offering to a health plan customer.
As part of our COVID-19 response, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Castlight was engaged by Boston Children’s Hospital to support its work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") to manage inventory and data related to COVID-19 vaccines. We will deliver a vaccine provider platform, which allows providers to enroll, log, and report inventory, daily reporting for the CDC, and display of COVID-19 vaccine information on VaccineFinder.org, a project of Boston Children’s Hospital. The agreement with Boston Children's Hospital provides for payments to the Company totaling $8.5 million. We began the work in November 2020 and expect to complete the engagement in mid-2021.
Employees, Culture and Human Capital Management
We recognize the fundamental importance of ensuring that we attract, recruit, develop, and retain top talent in order to create innovative products and services for our customers. Our ability to deliver on our mission to enable healthier, happier, and more productive lives starts by building a diverse team of employees that reflect the communities where we work and live, and the diversity of the customers we serve. Our human capital management strategy focuses on the whole employee lifecycle, follows a pay-for performance compensation program, and provides employees with comprehensive benefits and opportunities for advancement. 
Our concerted efforts to create an enduring culture of health & wellbeing is foundational to executing on an effective business strategy and we internally strive to be one of the best customers of our own solutions, by offering our employees access to Castlight Complete, Care Guides, and the services of our ecosystem partners in the space of behavioral health and emotional wellbeing.
Our People. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 440 full-time employees, in addition to engaging with a number of contractors and consultants. We believe we have assembled an action-oriented senior management team that brings a mix of experiences and backgrounds in healthcare as well as technology, and operates with deep belief and willingness to dedicate themselves to our mission. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Our Values. We operate under a set of core values that we believe capture who we are today as well as the future we are building together. Our values—One Team, On a Mission, Making Things Happen—are a consistent reminder of our mission and guide our day-to-day interactions:
•One Team: We act from a place of respect and care for all and assume positive intent. We value communication and collaboration across teams. We consider how our actions impact others. We continue to build a diverse and inclusive community of Castlighters that energizes and inspires our work.
•On a Mission: We exist to transform healthcare by empowering individuals to live healthier, happier lives. We create innovative, data-driven solutions to improve the wellbeing and healthcare journey of our users, including our employees. We address complex problems with pride, empathy, drive, and ownership.
•Making Things Happen: We grow and adapt in partnership with our customers. We are nimble and take accountability for creating world-class experiences for our users.
Employee Feedback. As we keep our customers at the center of all we do, serving our employees and creating an environment for Castlighters to thrive is one of our top priorities. We are intentional about keeping our pulse on employee engagement by conducting regular surveys focused on workplace elements such as the employees’ continued effectiveness in a remote environment, access to the necessary resources to be successful in their roles, and gauging our employees’ productivity, health, and wellbeing. We intend to continue to reinforce and monitor the voice of our employees through our surveys and other communication vehicles we use, including regular employee all-hands, Teams and Slack communication platforms, virtual roundtables and check-ins. In addition to a dedicated management team and the HR team driving the employee engagement and communication efforts, we have an employee-driven Culture team engaged in designing and creating employee recognition, virtual engagement events, volunteering/giving, culture, and inclusion efforts.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We believe we are a leader in diversity, inclusion, and sense of belonging, and seek to maintain our focus in these important areas for our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, women constitute 52% of our full-time workforce, 14% of our employees in the U.S. self-identified as a part of an under-represented minority group, and 40% of our employees at or above the Director level are women. Our talent acquisition program has led to steady, year-over-year increases in female and minority representation across Castlight, and we have established an annual hiring goal of 50% women and 20% individuals who identify as a member of an under-represented minority group. Our employees operate several Employee Resource Groups, including those for women in technology, LGBTQ-identified employees, and employee communities focused on interests such as cultural conversations and volunteering. 
COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify certain in-person practices with employees, including curtailing employee travel, cancelling physical participation in internal and external meetings, events and conferences, and moving to fully remote work in March 2020. In June 2020, we implemented a return to office protocol for some employees located in our Utah Customer Center of Excellence, with what we believe to be a comprehensive protocol to ensure safety and wellbeing, including daily health screenings through our Working Well solution, physical changes to our floor layout, and required proper personal protection equipment. Our return to office plans for our San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California offices remain subject to local health orders and we have not yet been able to permanently re-open those offices. 
Critically, as our workforce adjusted to the changing demands of the pandemic, we have continued to incorporate employee input and sentiment in our COVID-19 planning, and 86% of our employees who responded to our May 2020 employee engagement survey reported that they felt either “very supported” or “supported” by Castlight during COVID-19.

Sales and Marketing
We operate a national direct sales organization focused on large employers and on health plans, and also maintain partner relationships to enable sales and renewals. 
Our sales team comprises enterprise-focused field sales professionals who are organized into geography-based teams. Our field professionals target large, self-insured U.S. employers and health plans, with different teams assigned to employers and health plans. The sales team is supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals, and sales data experts.
We also employ a team of professionals who maintain relationships with key industry participants, including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations, and health plan partners. These partners can support our sales efforts to 
varying degrees by sourcing prospects, and working in collaboration with our direct sales team during the sales process. Through these relationships, we believe we are able to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health navigation platform and products.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. These programs target human resource executives and benefits leaders in addition to senior business leaders and health care and benefits channel partners, and include value-add research and learning opportunities for potential customers, channel marketing, demand generation activities, field marketing events, direct e-mail campaigns, and participation in user conferences, industry events, trade shows and customer conferences. In 2020, we adapted many of our marketing efforts due to COVID-19, including transitioning from in-person to digital events, and further investing in our digital marketing and engagement efforts. 
Technology and Operations
We have designed our technology infrastructure to provide a highly available and secure multi-tenant, SaaS offering. Our multi-tenant platforms allow us to use a standard data model and consistent management practices for all customers with multiple possible configurations, while securely partitioning each customer’s application data. This approach provides significant operating leverage and improved efficiency as it helps us reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. 
The architecture, deployment and management of our technology are focused on: 
•Scalability: We have developed a robust and scalable data architecture infrastructure, which allows for automated loading and normalization of numerous data sources, including billions of claim transactions in our data warehouse. 
•Standardization: Our technology assimilates structured and unstructured data from disparate sources, and employs proprietary algorithms to convert this data into user-friendly information for our users. Additionally, we design and operate our platform using Microservice Architecture principles, with a platform of services that delivers application functionality in a scalable and standardized way. 
•Security: We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data while protecting against the threats faced by a modern enterprise. We instill principles like least privilege, strong authentication, irrefutable audit trails, and guaranteed data integrity through controls such as mandatory multi-factor authentication, firewall-enforced network segmentation, encryption in transit, encryption at rest, and behavioral-based activity monitoring. These controls are universally enforced across our environment to afford a consistent level of protection. We routinely review our program in conjunction with our customers, partners, and vendors to improve our practices and adjust to the changing threat landscape.
•Privacy: Our comprehensive privacy program seeks to ensure the proper use and protection of personal information, preserve privacy fundamentals, and allow for meaningful user choice in the way we collect and use customer data. We work to earn our customer’s trust by fostering privacy principles (such as lawful use, minimization, accuracy, storage duration, integrity, accountability, and transparency) and best practices related to data stewardship, and incorporating privacy by design elements into our product development. We establish privacy and data protection policies to standardize definitions for privacy and data, create minimum uniform safeguards for business activities, and create processes for third parties with which we share personal data. We prioritize and create processes for individual rights requests pursuant to applicable laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). We promote a collaborative environment across all business activities and business owners to protect data privacy rights and drive compliance through knowledge sharing, guidance and enforcement.
We currently host our products from regionally dispersed data centers and lease third-party industry-class data center hosting facilities throughout the United States. We rely on third-party vendors to provide infrastructure support for our data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Our data center 
facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention.
Compliance and Certifications
Our software and data are located at independently managed and third-party data center hosting facilities. We require those vendors to obtain third-party security audit certifications relating to security and data privacy such as Service Organization Controls (“SOC”) SOC 1 or SOC 2 reports. Our vendors’ examinations are conducted at least every 12 months by an independent third-party auditor, and address, among other areas, physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures, and logical security procedures. 
Our own operating processes and technologies undergo annual independent evaluations such as penetration testing, security audits (SOC 2 Type II), and readiness evaluations to validate our controls and provide confidence that we are meeting evolving security needs. Annual internal audits are based upon the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 that addresses, among other things, security, data privacy, and operational controls.
Strategic Relationships
Data Collaborations. We have existing relationships with many national and regional health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, dental insurers, behavioral health plans, and health savings plans to support our mutual customers. These collaborations provide us with claims, balance integrations, and other data on behalf of our employer customers. We have developed technologies in collaboration with several payers, including real-time integrated APIs. The increasing number of data integrations we have in place is helping to position Castlight as a health navigation platform for our customers, and enables employers — and health plans — to consolidate many of their sources of benefits information into a single point of reference. In addition to providing data to support customers, we believe health plans may also provide an avenue to reach a broader set of potential customers. 
Benefit Consultants and Brokers. Our relationships with brokers and consultants complement our direct sales capabilities. Through these relationships, we gain the ability to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health navigation platform and cross-pollinate customer opportunities.
Ecosystem Partners. Castlight offers a broad and deep ecosystem of digital health solutions, providing customers access to turnkey, API-driven integrations with digital health tools, and offering clients a streamlined experience for users. Our customers can procure pre-vetted point solutions on Castlight’s contract paper, for a rapid, turnkey integration into their benefits offering. We simplify vendor management by providing our customers with one point of contact, tier 1 user support, and a unified reporting dashboard with insights aggregated across all vendors.
In addition to our partner ecosystem partnerships, we also have performed over 1,000 third-party customer integrations that deliver effortless access to external benefit programs for our users. These integrations result in higher engagement with third-party programs, based on personalized recommendations and an omni-channel approach to communications.
COVID-19. In developing our COVID-19 Test Site Finder and delivering on our COVID-19 resource center and analytics, we collaborated with a number of large technology companies, such as Google and Amazon Alexa; state and local public health departments, such as the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services; and provider organizations or digital health solutions, such as Forward or 98point6. We believe these relationships may offer value for marketing, business development, or customer acquisition purposes over time.
Competition
The health navigation market is evolving and highly competitive. We face competitive pressure from a number of traditional digital health categories, as specialists in navigation, wellbeing, concierge, care guidance, and member engagement converge to compete in this market. Our most common and significant competitors include Accolade, Quantum, Grand Rounds, Evive, Alight, and Virgin Pulse. 
In addition to competitive pressure in our core category, we also continue to experience competitive pressures from a number of vendors who remain more narrowly focused on just one area of historical demand for Castlight, including: 
• Care Guidance competitors: ClearCost Health, Sapphire Digital (formerly Vitals), Healthcare Bluebook, HealthAdvocate, HealthSparq; and
• Wellbeing competitors: Limeade, Sharecare, Welltok, and Vitality.
In addition to standalone competitors, Castlight also competes against a number of offerings delivered by U.S. health plans in these categories. These health plan competitors include United Healthcare Group, Cigna, Anthem, Inc., Aetna Inc., and Health Care Services Corporation.

For additional discussion of the risks related to our competitive landscape, please see the risk factor entitled “We operate in a competitive industry. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed” set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain, and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers, and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2020, we had one issued patent and two patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patent expires on July 27, 2031. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and elsewhere. We have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our products are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
For a discussion of risks related to the protection of our intellectual property, please see the risk factors entitled “Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our 
brand,”;“We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights”; and “Our use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our software platform" set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Regulatory Environment
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, both at the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. 
For a discussion of risks related to our regulatory environment, please see the risk factors entitled “The health care industry is heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and otherwise negatively affect our business,” and “If we fail to comply with applicable health information privacy and security laws and other applicable state, federal and international privacy and security laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities, reputational harm and other negative consequences, including decreasing the willingness of current and potential customers to work with us” set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
U.S. Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. In 2019, California passed a privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which gives California resident users significant rights over the use of their personal information, including the right to object to the “sale” of their personal information. In addition, the CCPA includes a private right of action related to security breaches. Less than one year after the CCPA became effective, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), a consumer privacy ballot initiative that amends and expands the CCPA. The CPRA affords California residents more control over their personal information, imposes heightened compliance requirements, and establishes a new enforcement agency dedicated to consumer privacy. The CPRA’s substantive provisions become effective January 1, 2023. Several other states are considering similar legislation, and new laws similar to CCPA, CPRS and GDPR (discussed below) are expected to be enacted in coming years in various jurisdictions in which we operate.
Additionally, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, (collectively, "HIPAA"), establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information ("PHI") and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. 
Our health plan customers, our direct enterprise customers’ benefits plans, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” are independent contractors or agents of covered entities which create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. 
Under HIPAA, Castlight serves as a “business associate” to our customers and is directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of their PHI, Castlight enters into business associate agreements with our customers that require us to, among other things:
•limit how we will use and disclose PHI;
•implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI from misuse;
•enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors who have access to PHI;
•report security incidents, breaches, and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and
•assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards. 
International Privacy Requirements. In Europe, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which replaced the 1995 European Union (“EU”) Directive on Data Protection in May 2018. GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of European Union residents, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. In Canada, we are subject to Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"). PIPEDA, as well as province-specific regulations, imposes specific obligations on includes requirements for companies that receive personal information for Canadian residents, and includes penalties for non-compliance. 
Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, and confidentiality of personally identifiable information, individually identifiable health information, and health care provider information. Some states also have implemented new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, and security of such information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our customers’ and users' information, including confidential and PHI. Our security strategy employs various practices and technology to control and protect access to sensitive information. 
For a discussion of risks related to data privacy requirements and regulations related thereto, please see the risk factor entitled “If we fail to comply with applicable health information privacy and security laws and other applicable state, federal and international privacy and security laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities, reputational harm and other negative consequences, including decreasing the willingness of current and potential customers to work with us” set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
