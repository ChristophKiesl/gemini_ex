Item 1.    Business
The terms "we," "us," "our," "Registrant," or "Company" in this Report refer to Kadant Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Description of Our Business
We are a leading global supplier of equipment and critical components used in process industries worldwide. In addition, we manufacture granules made from papermaking by-products. We have a diverse and large customer base, including most of the world's major paper and oriented strand board (OSB) manufacturers, and our products, technologies and services play an integral role in enhancing process efficiency, optimizing energy utilization, and maximizing productivity in resource-intensive industries. We believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business. In 2016*, approximately 62% of our revenue was from the sale of parts and consumables products.
Our continuing operations are comprised of two reportable operating segments, Papermaking Systems and Wood Processing Systems, and a separate product line, Fiber-based Products. Through our Papermaking Systems segment, we develop, manufacture, and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking, paper recycling, recycling and waste management, and other process industries. Through our Wood Processing Systems segment, we develop, manufacture, and market stranders and related equipment used in the production of OSB, and sell debarking and wood chipping equipment used in the forest products and the pulp and paper industries. Through this segment, we also provide refurbishment and repair of pulping equipment for the pulp and paper industry. Through our Fiber-based Products business, we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural, home lawn and garden, and professional lawn, turf and ornamental applications, as well as for oil and grease absorption.
On April 4, 2016, we acquired all the outstanding shares of RT Holding GmbH, the parent corporation of a group of companies known as the PAALGROUP (PAAL), for approximately 49.7 million euros, net of cash acquired, or approximately $56.6 million. PAAL manufactures balers and related equipment used in the processing of recyclable and waste materials. This acquisition, which is included in our Papermaking Systems segment's Stock-Preparation product line, broadened our product portfolio and extended our presence deeper into recycling and waste management. PAAL, headquartered in Germany, also has operations in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain.
Papermaking Systems Segment
Our Papermaking Systems segment has a long and well-established history of developing, manufacturing, and marketing equipment for the global papermaking and paper recycling industries. Some of our businesses or their predecessor companies have been in operation for more than 100 years. Our customer base includes major global paper manufacturers and we believe we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the markets we serve within the pulp and paper industry. We manufacture our products in ten countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.
