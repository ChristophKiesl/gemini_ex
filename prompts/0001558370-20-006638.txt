 Item 1. Business.
     General
     We are an onshore independent oil and natural gas company focused on the development, production and exploration of large, repeatable resource plays in North America. Our operations consist primarily of drilling and production from unconventional horizontal wells targeting the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas.       Strategy
     Our strategy is to acquire and/or develop assets where we are operator and have high working interests, positioning us to efficiently control the pace and scope of our development and the allocation of our capital resources. We also believe that serving as operator allows us to control the drilling, completion, operations and marketing of sold volumes.  We plan to continue to focus on developing high-return assets from our portfolio, while preserving an attractive oil-rich inventory.  We continue to realize cost improvement by reducing our operating costs and per well drilling and completion costs.  We intend to manage our liquidity by scaling our 2020 capital program to remain within our operating cash flow. We believe execution of each of these focus areas should increase long-term shareholder value.

 Oil and Natural Gas Properties

Description of Properties
 All of our operations and assets are located in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas. Since entering the Eagle Ford play in 2014, we have built a strong assets base that includes over 41,000 net acres targeting the Eagle Ford, through a combination of property acquisitions and development of proved reserves.  Our 2018 acquisition of approximately 21,900 net acres in the Eagle Ford in McMullen, Live Oak, Atascosa and La Salle counties, Texas has positioned us to compete more effectively in this market by offering economies of scale and positioning us to compete for further acquisition opportunities in this area. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 97% of our net producing wells and our average working interest in our operated wells was approximately 95%.       Estimated Proved Reserves
     The following table presents summary information regarding our estimated net proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves as of the dates indicated. The estimates of our net proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are based on the reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent petroleum engineers, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding oil and natural gas reserve reporting. For more information about our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, please see the reports to management prepared by Ryder Scott, which have been filed or incorporated by reference, as exhibits to this annual report.  All of reserves were located in the Eagle Ford.

      Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers may vary and are subject to change with additional data. Furthermore, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, operational changes, regulatory changes, environmental protection, prices and costs, and reservoir performance. Please read Part I, Item IA. “Risk Factors” of this annual report.

 Additional information regarding our proved reserves can be found in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report.
     PV‑10
     Certain of our oil and natural gas reserve disclosures included in this annual report are presented on a PV‑10 basis. PV‑10 is the estimated present value of the future cash flows less future development and production costs from our proved reserves before income taxes discounted using a 10% discount rate. PV‑10 may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC because it does not include the effects of future income taxes, as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the “Standardized Measure”). We believe that PV‑10 is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and is widely used by securities analysts and investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe that the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies.  Investors should be cautioned that neither PV‑10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our proved reserves.

      Proved Undeveloped Reserves
     Annually, management develops a five-year development plan based on our best available data at the time the plan is developed. Our five-year plan incorporates a development plan for converting PUD reserves to proved developed. The development plan includes only PUD reserves that we are reasonably certain will be spud within five years of initial booking based upon management’s evaluation of a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including estimated risk-based returns, commodity prices and cost forecasts and recent drilling and well performance.   Our five-year development plan generally does not contemplate a uniform conversion of our PUD reserves to proved developed.  At December 31, 2019, our short-term strategy was to slow the pace of development in 2020 and 2021, which would allow cash flow to accumulate.  The accumulated cash flow would be used to fund an increased pace of development in later years, such that all remaining proved undeveloped locations would be developed within the five-year period. 
      Management reviews and revises the development plan throughout the year and may modify the development plan after evaluating the factors noted above, as well as realized commodity prices, cost and availability of services and equipment, acquisition and divestiture activity; and our current and projected financial condition and liquidity. If there are changes that result in certain PUD reserves no longer being scheduled for development within five years from the date of initial booking, we reclassify those PUD reserve locations to unproved reserve categories. In addition, PUD locations and reserves may be removed from the development plan prior to their five-year expiration as a result of changes in our development plan related to factors discussed above.

 The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs during the years ended December 31, 2019: 
    
 | PUD Reserves
 | (MBoe) 
As of December 31, 2018 | 66,044 
Extensions and discoveries | 36,535 
Sales of reserves in place | (1,736) 
Revisions of prior estimates | (19,881) 
Conversion of proved undeveloped to proved developed | (4,501) 
As of December 31, 2019 | 76,461 

      During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $69.5 million to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. The remainder of capital expenditures for our proved properties for the period were related to wells in process, development of reserve locations that were not previously classified as proved, infrastructure and installation of artificial lift on proved developed producing reserves. 
     As of December 31, 2019, our proved undeveloped reserves were approximately 76,461 MBoe, an increase of 10,417 MBoe over our December 31, 2018 proved undeveloped reserves estimate of approximately 66,044 MBoe.  The change primarily resulted from proved undeveloped locations added in 2019 as result of our technical evaluation of wells drilled and completed in late 2018 and in 2019 on properties acquired in 2018 (total extensions of 36,535 MBoe).  As of December 31, 2018, we were still in the process of evaluating many of the undeveloped locations acquired in 2018, and at that time approximately half of the undeveloped locations in our development plan were on acreage acquired in the 2018 Eagle Ford acquisition.  The remainder of the December 31, 2018 proved undeveloped locations were on properties that we owned prior to the 2018 acquisition.  As a result of our additional technical evaluation of the acquired properties during 2019, the focus of our development plan shifted to properties acquired in 2018 with higher projected returns, and we had revisions of 19,881 MBoe primarily associated with approximately 50 proved undeveloped locations on legacy properties that were removed because we expect them to be drilled outside the 5-year window.  
     Independent Reserve Engineers
 Our reserve estimates are calculated by Ryder Scott as of December 31, 2019 in accordance with SEC guidelines. The reserve estimates are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under supervision of Mr. Stephen E. Gardner. Mr. Gardner is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the States of Colorado (Colorado No. 44720) and Texas (Texas No. 100578) with over 14 years of practical experience in estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves. Mr. Gardner meets or exceeds the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We believe that he is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. Mr. Gardner consents to the inclusion in this report of the information and context in which it appears.

Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process        The primary inputs into the reserve estimation process are comprised of technical information, financial data, ownership interests and production data. Our technical team consists of an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to our independent reserve engineers in their reserves estimation process. Throughout each fiscal year, our technical team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates. 
     Our board of directors has also established a Reserves Committee to assist with monitoring (i) the integrity of our oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves, (ii) the independence, qualifications and performance of our independent reservoir engineers, and (iii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Prior to release of the reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers, the draft of the report is reviewed by the Reserves Committee, our internal petroleum engineers and management.

 Our senior reservoir engineer is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserves estimates and year-end third-party report of our reserves estimates. He received his Masters of Science and Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines.  He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.  The senior reservoir engineer currently reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.
     Technology Used to Establish Estimates of Proved Reserves
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 
 To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, Ryder Scott employed or reviewed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data, well test data, simulation, and statistical methods. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using both volumetric estimates and performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
     Acreage
     We had the following developed, undeveloped and total acres as of December 31, 2019:
    
 | Developed | Undeveloped | Total 
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Eagle Ford (1) | 21,869 | 19,652 | 35,501 | 26,776 | 57,370 | 46,428


(1) | Includes 1,573 gross (1,438 net) developed acres and 7,617 gross (3,808 net) undeveloped acres located in Texas, targeting non Eagle Ford formations.

 Operations
     General
     We operated 97% of our production for the year ended December 31, 2019.  As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis.      Marketing and Customers
     For the year ended December 31, 2019, purchases by two customers each accounted for over 10% of our total sales revenues. Our largest customer, a large midstream company and production purchaser accounted for approximately 60% of our 2019 revenue. We have a long-term contract in place with this customer, under which we are subject to minimum revenue commitments (“MRCs”) for gathering, processing, transportation and marketing services, with $54.3 million remaining through 2022 (described more below in Part I, Item 1. “Business” under “Delivery Commitments”). Our second largest customer, a large physical trading and logistics company, accounted for approximately 21% of our 2019 revenue. Our agreement with this purchaser ended in September 2019, and was replaced by a marketing agreement with another large physical trading company.   
     The oil and natural gas that we sell are commodities for which there are a large number of potential buyers. Because of the adequacy of the infrastructure to transport oil and natural gas in the areas in which we operate, if we were to lose one or more customers, we believe that we could readily procure substitute or additional customers such that our production volumes would not be materially affected for any significant period of time.
     The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production fluctuate widely. Factors that cause price fluctuations include global economic and political conditions, the level of demand for oil and natural gas, the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas, the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production, global oil and gas inventories, weather conditions and natural disasters, the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, governmental regulations, oil and natural gas speculation, actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (“OPEC”), technological advances and the price and availability of alternative fuels. Decreases in these commodity prices adversely affect the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Short-term disruptions of our oil and natural gas production occur from time to time due to downstream pipeline system failure, capacity issues and scheduled maintenance, as well as maintenance and repairs involving our own well operations. These situations, if they occur, curtail our production capabilities and ability to maintain a steady source of revenue. In addition, demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal in nature, with peak demand and typically higher prices during the colder winter months.
    
Delivery Commitments
     In conjunction with our 2018 acquisition, we entered into contracts with a large midstream company to provide gathering, processing, transportation and marketing of hydrocarbon production for the acquired properties.  The contracts contain MRCs that requires us to pay minimum annual fees related to gathering, processing, transportation and marketing.  Volumetric fixed fees are expensed as incurred and settled with the midstream company on a monthly basis.  The following table summarizes the remaining MRC (in thousands) by year:
 | Year ending December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2021 | | 2022 | Total
Hydrocarbon gathering and handling agreement | $ | 14,297 | | $ | 13,972 | $ | 6,675 | $ | 34,944
Crude oil and condensate purchase agreements | | 4,710 | | | 7,513 | | 4,317 | | 16,540
Gas processing agreement | | 2,017 | | | - | | - | | 2,017 
Gas transportation agreements | | 783 | | | - | | - | | 783 
Total MRC | $ | 21,807 | | $ | 21,485 | $ | 10,992 | $ | 54,284

     

 
  10
 

 If, at the end of any calendar year during the term of the contract, we fail to satisfy our MRC with the monthly settlements paid during the year, we are required to pay a deficiency payment equal to the shortfall.  If the volumes and associated fees exceed the MRC in any contractual year, the overage can be applied to reduce the future shortfalls, if any.  
 The MRC for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $15.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, and we realized a shortfall of $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.  Based on our 2019 development plan, we had anticipated an immaterial MRC shortfall, however, midstream constraints reduced our sales volumes, and increased the amount of the 2019 shortfall.  The 2018 commitment was measured on a calendar year basis; however, we did not own and operate the acquired assets until April 23, 2018.  Due to the timing of the acquisition, our development program was back-loaded in 2018, and we were unable to meet the 2018 MRC.   
     Current production from the producing wells dedicated under these agreements is not sufficient to meet the MRC for the hydrocarbon gathering and handling agreement.  Based on our current 2020 development plan, we expect we will have a shortfall under the hydrocarbon gathering and handling agreement for the year ending December 31, 2020.  Our ability to meet our commitments in future periods will depend on our pace of development through the term of the contract.  Our development plan is subject to a number of risks, many of which are not within our control. 
     Competition
     The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater resources than we do. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties and obtaining drilling rigs, completion crews and other services.  Our competitors may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and undeveloped prospects, or bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial resources permit. 
     There is also competition between producers of oil and natural gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by state, local and the U.S. government agencies. However, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to better absorb the burden of existing and changing federal, state or local laws and regulations than we can, which would adversely impact our competitive position. 
     Seasonality of Business
     We do not believe that the pricing of our crude oil and NGL production is subject to any meaningful seasonal effects. Historically, the pricing of natural gas is seasonal, typically with higher pricing in the winter months.     Title to Properties
    
Title to our properties are subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
    
As is customary in the industry, a preliminary title investigation, typically consisting of a review of local title records, is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. More thorough title investigations, which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside legal counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.


 
  11
 

 Government Regulations
    
Nearly every aspect of our business is subject to expansive federal, state, and local laws and governmental regulations. These laws and regulations frequently change in response to economic or political conditions, or other developments, and our regulatory burden may increase in the future. Laws and regulations have the potential to increase our cost of doing business and consequently could affect our profitability. However, we do not believe that we are affected to a materially greater or lesser extent than others in our industry.     Regulation of Production
    
The State of Texas, the state where we conduct operations and own nearly all of our oil and gas assets, has adopted laws and regulations governing the exploration for and production of oil, gas, and NGLs, including laws and regulations requiring permits for the drilling of wells, imposing bond requirements in order to drill or operate wells, governing the timing of drilling and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to Texas conservation laws and regulations, including regulations governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area, the spacing of wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, Texas conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit or prohibit the venting or flaring of gas, and may impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
    
Our sales of gas are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of gas pipeline transportation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of gas in interstate commerce.  FERC’s current regulatory framework generally provides for a competitive and open access market for sales and transportation of gas. However, FERC regulations continue to affect the midstream and transportation segments of the industry, and thus can indirectly affect the sales prices we receive for gas production.
     Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
     Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, including requirements to:
· | obtain permits to conduct regulated activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could increase the cost of developing our properties. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of operations on our properties, causing our operators to incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
     Increased costs or operating restrictions on our properties as a result of compliance with environmental laws could result in reduced exploratory and production activities on our properties and, as a result, our revenues and results of operations. The following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which operations on our properties are subject.
     Hazardous Substances and Waste 
     The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. CERCLA exempts “petroleum, including oil or any fraction thereof” from the definition of “hazardous substance” unless specifically listed or designated under CERCLA. While the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) interprets CERCLA to exclude oil and fractions of oil, hazardous substances that are added to petroleum or that increase in concentration as a result of contamination of the petroleum during use are not considered part of the petroleum and are regulated under CERCLA as a hazardous substance. Comparable state statutes may include petroleum in the definition of hazardous substance. 
      Responsible persons under CERCLA include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances under CERCLA. 
     We also generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. RCRA regulations specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and cleanup requirements. No such effort has been successful to date.

 We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 
     Air Emissions 
     The Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases, from many sources, including oil and natural gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements, report emissions, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. CAA rules may require us to undertake certain expenditures and activities, including purchasing and installing emissions control equipment and implementing additional emissions testing and monitoring. These requirements have the potential to delay or increase the cost of the development of oil and natural gas projects. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs or negatively impact our production and operations. For example, in 2015, the EPA released a final rule tightening the primary and secondary NAAQS for ground-level ozone from its 2008 standard levels of 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) to 70 ppb. If areas in which we operate are designated as nonattainment or if the EPA were to further reduce ozone standards, bringing areas in which we operate into nonattainment, states that contain any areas designated nonattainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, are required to develop state implementation plans demonstrating how the area will attain the standard within a prescribed period of time. These plans may require the installation of additional equipment to control emissions. Similar initiatives could lead to more stringent air permitting, increased regulation and possible enforcement actions at the local, state, and federal levels.
     Additionally, the EPA has established new air emission control requirements for oil, natural gas and NGLs production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) by October 15, 2012, if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include maximum achievable control technology standards for “small” glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves.

 In 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. Many of these requirements were rescinded in a proposed rule published by the EPA in August 2019, which has not yet been finalized. However, the 2016 rule currently remains in effect. Similarly in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued rules requiring additional efforts by producers to reduce venting, flaring, and leaking of natural gas produced on federal and Native American lands, though many of these regulations were later rescinded by a final rule published by the BLM in September 2018. Compliance with these or other future changes to regulations regarding air emission may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. 
     Climate Change 
     The U.S. is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty focused on stabilizing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent serious damage to the climate system. In December 2015, the international community agreed upon a new climate change treaty, known as the Paris Agreement. The U.S. committed to a 26-28% reduction in its GHG emissions by 2025 against a 2005 baseline. This new agreement, which was legally effective in November 2016, incorporates actions taken by individual countries to reduce GHG on the national level. U.S. involvement in developing the new agreement creates significant international pressure for the U.S. to take responsive action to reduce GHG emissions. President Trump stated in June 2017 that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and in November 2019, the U.S. submitted formal notification of its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement to the United Nations. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest the U.S. could withdraw from the treaty is November 2020. The Trump administration may allow the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement, but soften the emission reductions that the U.S. implements to comply with the Paris Agreement. In general, implementation of the Paris Agreement would encourage a shift away from higher GHG emitting power sources like coal-fired power plants. 
      In the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation, regulatory action to regulate GHG emissions under the federal Clean Air Act occurred under the Obama administration. The Trump administration is in the process of narrowing, revising or attempting to repeal nearly all of the Obama-era climate regulations. Thus, no new federal climate regulations that impose additional requirements are likely in the near term in the U.S. and the focus will be on the state level with certain states like California taking significant actions to reduce GHG emissions. 
       The EPA requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including GHG from petroleum and natural gas systems that emit more than 25,000 tons of GHG per year. Reporting is required from onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production, natural gas processing, transmission and distribution, underground natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas import, export and storage. 
      In 2015, the EPA released the final Clean Power Plan, which is a regulation designed to reduce carbon pollution from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, including natural gas power plants. Upon finalization of the Clean Power Plan, over twenty states and industry groups challenged the rule in the D.C. Circuit court and requested a stay of the rule. In 2019, the EPA replaced the Clean Power Plan with the more narrowly-scoped Affordable Clean Energy rule. The rule is currently being litigated by public health groups, certain states and environmental groups. 
      In 2016, the EPA issued a suite of proposed regulations that would reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, including proposed updates to the NSPS for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry, a clarification of the source determination rule as applied to the oil and natural gas industry and a proposed Federal Implementation Plan for new oil and gas sources in Indian Country. These regulations could affect us indirectly by affecting our customer base or by directly regulating our operations. In either case, increased costs of operation and exposure to liability could result. In 2019, the EPA proposed to replace existing NSPS methane limits with a narrower rule and to amend the Federal Implementation Plan for oil and gas production activities in Indian Country. The EPA is currently reviewing public comments on the proposed rules.

 In 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to rescind President Obama’s climate-related executive orders and climate action plans and to direct the EPA to review and revise the Clean Power Plan, the standards for new power plants and other climate regulations. The executive order sets in motion a process that will take several years to fully implement. Because the EPA climate regulations are final regulations, the EPA will have to go through a notice and comment rulemaking process to modify or revoke them and such actions are expected to be litigated by environmental groups and states supportive of the regulations. Even if the carbon regulations are ultimately revoked or weakened under the Trump administration, we may continue to incur compliance costs and we may incur new costs associated with transitioning to the new requirements. 
      The EPA’s GHG rules are being reviewed pursuant to President Trump’s executive order and many are being challenged in court proceedings. Depending on the outcome of such proceedings, the rules may be modified or rescinded or the EPA could develop new rules. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. 
      While new legislation requiring GHG controls is not expected at the national level in the near term, almost one-half of the states have taken actions to monitor and/or reduce emissions of GHG, including obligations on utilities to purchase renewable energy and participate in GHG cap and trade programs. Although most of the state level initiatives have to date focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as coal-fired electric plants, it is possible that smaller sources of emissions could become subject to GHG emission limitations or allowance purchase requirements in the future. 
      Climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources, such as coal, our products could become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources, such as solar and wind, our products could become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations. 
      Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Such effects could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas we produce or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. 
     Water Discharges 
     The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained from the EPA or analogous state agency to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of stormwater runoff from certain types of facilities. Currently, storm water discharges from oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing or treatment operations, or transmission facilities are exempt from regulation under the CWA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as other enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.

 Endangered Species Act 
     The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.      Employee Health and Safety 
     We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations regulating employee health and safety, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (the “OSH Act”), and comparable state statutes. In addition, the OSH Act’s hazard communication standard, the EPA’s “community right-to-know” regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used, produced or released in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSH Act regulates worker exposure to respirable dust from silica sand, a common additive to hydraulic fracturing fluids. The key provisions of the rule: (i) reduce the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable crystalline silica to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air, averaged over an 8‑hour shift; (ii) require employers to: use engineering controls (such as water or ventilation) to limit worker exposure to the PEL; provide respirators when engineering controls cannot adequately limit exposure; limit worker access to high exposure areas; develop a written exposure control plan, offer medical exams to highly exposed workers, and train workers on silica risks and how to limit exposures; (iii) provide medical exams to monitor highly exposed workers and gives them information about their lung health; and (iv) provide flexibility to help employers protect workers from silica exposure. Workers at well sites may be exposed to excessive levels of respirable silica sand, which can cause lung disease and cancer. Increasing concerns about worker safety at well sites may lead to increased regulation and enforcement or related tort claims by our employees. Implementation of engineering and workplace controls to comply with the rule may require significant investment.      Hydraulic Fracturing 
     The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and natural gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in our operations as a means of maximizing the productivity of our wells and operate saltwater disposal wells to dispose of produced water. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude hydraulic fracturing without diesel additives from the definition of “underground injection.” However, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have considered several bills in recent years to end this exemption, as well as other exemptions for oil and gas activities under U.S. environmental laws. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”), first introduced in 2011, would amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption from regulation under the UIC program for hydraulic fracturing. This bill has been reintroduced in each congressional session since it was initially proposed but has not yet garnered enough support to be put to a vote. If enacted, the FRAC Act would amend the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, to adhere to certain construction specifications, to fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and to meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. Note that each of the above components of the FRAC Act have become increasingly common in state laws since the FRAC Act was first introduced. Other bills that have been introduced in recent years in the U.S. House of Representatives would end certain exemptions for oil and natural gas operations related to permitting requirements for multiple commonly owned and adjacent sources of hazardous air pollutants under the CAA and permitting requirements for stormwater discharges under the CWA. If the exemptions for hydraulic fracturing are removed from U.S. environmental laws, or if the FRAC Act or other legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level, any restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing contained in any such legislation could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Federal agencies have also begun to directly regulate hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over, and issued permitting guidance for, hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA’s UIC Program. As a result, service providers or companies that use diesel products in the hydraulic fracturing process are expected to be subject to additional permitting requirements or enforcement actions under the SDWA. The EPA has promulgated pretreatment standards for oil and gas extraction category under the CWA that prohibit the discharge of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. The EPA also has been conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA collected data and information related to the extent to which such wastewater is accepted, available treatment technologies, discharge characteristics and other information. The EPA is currently reviewing comments on the draft study report. The use of surface impoundments (i.e., pits or surface storage tanks) for the temporary storage of hydraulic fracturing fluids for re-use or prior to disposal may also be regulated. The EPA also completed a multi-year study about the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. Although the regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal land that were promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2015 were rescinded in 2017, that 2017 rulemaking is the subject of ongoing litigation. These regulatory developments have the potential to create additional permitting, technology, recordkeeping and site study requirements, among others, for our business. However, under the Trump administration, we expect no new significant requirements on hydraulic fracking. 
     Several state governments in the areas where we operate have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration and disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing. For example, several states have implemented rules requiring hydraulic fracturing operators to sample ground and surface waters near proposed well sites before operations can begin, and to sample the same sites again after fracturing operations are complete. A majority of states around the country, including Texas, have also adopted some form of fracturing fluid disclosure law to compel disclosure of fracturing fluid ingredients and additives that are not subject to trade secret protection. Other states, such as Ohio and Texas, have begun to study potential seismic risks related to underground injection of fracturing fluids. Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions of our operations. 
     At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. 
     Insurance Matters
     As is common in the oil and gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business, either because such insurance is not available or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2019, we had 79 employees (all employed full-time). None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
     We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, engineering, regulatory, accounting and other disciplines as needed.
