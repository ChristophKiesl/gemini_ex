Item 1. BusinessCompany Overview
 
TSS, Inc. is a provider of comprehensive services for the planning, design, development and maintenance of mission-critical facilities and information infrastructure as well as integration services for the equipment used in those facilities. We provide a single-source solution for highly technical mission-critical facilities such as data centers, operation centers, network facilities, server rooms, security operations centers, communications facilities and the infrastructure systems that are critical to their function. Our services include technology consulting, design and engineering, project management, systems integration, system installations and facilities management. Through actions taken in the second half of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 as described below, we believe we have streamlined our business and reduced operating expenses that will improve liquidity and assist us in achieving consistent profitability.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in December 2004. As a holding company, we operate through our wholly owned subsidiaries, VTC, LLC d/b/a Total Site Solutions (“VTC”) and Innovative Power Systems, Inc. Our headquarters are in Round Rock, Texas, and we have offices in Dulles, Virginia, and Los Altos, California.
 
Our business is concentrated on the data center infrastructure and services market. This market continues to be highly competitive as commerce moves to cloud-based solutions and as data storage requirements continue to escalate exponentially driven by video, mobility and big data requirements. These underlying macroeconomic trends are driving demand for more information technology equipment, and more efficient data center design and operation, resulting in continued overall growth in this market. We compete in large growing market segments often against larger competitors who have greater resources. We have been successful with several large customers in winning contracts and providing business to us under “Master Service Agreements”, and the loss of such customers could have a material negative effect on our results.
 
We believe that as one of the few companies providing a single source for all phases of data center ownership, from design through construction, equipment integration and deployment, operations, maintenance and decommissioning, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the continued growth and evolution in the data center market. The services we offer are applicable to traditional brick-and-mortar facilities and to new modular form factors. We believe our ability to help customers lower the cost of operating their mission-critical facilities surpasses the type and scale of equipment or infrastructure being used by our customers. We are also working with IT equipment manufacturers to help them deploy their equipment into data centers, which enables us to establish relationships with their customers.
 
Over the last several years we have changed our business strategy to pivot the business focus from large, one-off, low-margin data center design and build projects towards services such as our facilities management offering that provide greater recurring revenue streams from ongoing services. This shift was intended to reduce quarterly fluctuations in revenues and margins, and to transition us towards higher margin service lines to improve the profitability of the Company. As part of this strategy, we acquired our systems integration business in 2013 to broaden and diversify our service offering for the data center services market. In 2016 we sold off a portion of our facilities management business in Maryland that was not geared towards the modular data center market, and made the decision to outsource a number of services including consulting engineering and project management that we had previously provided directly. We believe that we can still provide these services to customers when required through use of third party contractors, but that we can improve our overall profitability by eliminating staffing and overhead, and by remaining focused on higher margin, recurring revenue opportunities. In January 2017, we sold off another customer contract that was a part of our project management business. Collectively these actions generated $1.3 million in proceeds, resulted in staffing reductions, and allowed us to close our facility in Maryland. These actions will lower our operating expenses and improve our efforts at achieving ongoing profitability.
 
Service Offerings
 
We have developed a unique set of solution offerings whereby we provide a range of services that enable our customers and partners to more efficiently plan, develop, deploy and maintain data centers and their related assets. These solutions begin with strategies for the care of information technology assets that are being housed in the facility or modular data center, including power, cooling and heat rejection, as well as disaster recovery backup systems. We assist our customers and partners in developing and implementing total cost of ownership models that enable them to design and build efficient data centers based on their available capital. Our operating expenses are not exclusively aligned to each service offering, as shared resources such as sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses support all services. Our solutions involve all aspects of the life cycle of both traditional and modular data centers and are described in more detail below.

Facilities Services:
 
Consulting: 
 
During the initial phase of a data center project, we provide project development related services that typically include establishing project goals and a preliminary budget and schedules, setting technical parameters and requirements, and determining project team members and the overall requirements of the team.
 
Design and engineering consulting services typically include critical power and mechanical load calculations, mechanical design and engineering, high and medium voltage electrical design and engineering, communications and security systems design and engineering, physical vulnerability assessments, force protection design and bomb blast analyses, fire protection system design and engineering, facility systems equipment selection and facility commissioning and testing. These offerings also include post commissioning support of on-going operations.
 
Our strategy is intended to increase the amount of recurring revenues we generate from our existing customers, IT equipment partners, and major systems integrators. Our mission critical facilities experience and skills position us as a trusted advisor to our customers, and allow us to work on new opportunities as our customers grow and partners introduce us to new client opportunities. We now primarily out-source these services following staff changes made during 2016.
 
Deployment:
 
In connection with the deployment of a customer’s data center or related equipment requirements, our capabilities include project management, value engineering and design management, bid negotiation support, subcontractor pre-qualification and selection, long-lead equipment procurement, issuance of equipment and construction contracts, and refinement and management of project budgets and schedules. Our project managers mobilize the required expertise for the project, utilizing project superintendents, quality control and safety professionals, as well as qualified subcontractors and support personnel. Project managers supervise work by project team members, including subcontracted parties, including all aspects of the following: architecture and construction, electric power systems, heat rejection and cooling, energy management and controls, cooling tower systems, security systems, voice, data and network cabling, fire and life safety systems, and process piping and plumbing systems. The project manager remains responsible for managing all aspects of the project until project completion and customer delivery.
 
 Management of the installation portion of facility projects is typically the longest in duration when compared to other project phases. In addition, this portion has the largest number of outside influences that can impact project goals and objectives, such as weather, non-performance of subcontractors, equipment deliveries, unexpected project changes from the owner, and influence from local authorities and utility providers. Therefore, experience, skill and mission focus are critical during the project installation period.
 
Management:
 
We provide a comprehensive maintenance and service offering designed to ensure that the multiple systems critical to sustaining on-line applications in technologically intensive facilities and modular data centers remain operational and functional. Typical facilities management services include overall management of the post-construction facility maintenance program, on-site staffing of technical engineering positions (e.g., electricians, HVAC mechanics, control technicians and voice/data technicians), and management of non-technical subcontracted services (e.g., security, landscaping, janitorial, pest control, snow removal, carpentry, painting and general maintenance services). Increasingly, data centers are being constructed in a modular format, whereby information technology, power and other related assets are deployed in pre-integrated solutions. Modular data centers may have lower overall cost of delivery, lower energy consumption and shorter deployment schedules compared to traditional data centers. We have developed a team to deploy and maintain high-density modular data centers. Our on-site maintenance services provide additional project revenue for us, and also position us for involvement in any new facility planning, design and construction initiatives that the customer undertakes.

In addition, we have a 24X7 Network Operations Center in Round Rock, Texas that has the capability of remotely monitoring our data center service contract customers’ facilities for systems operations and emergency events that could lead to outages. Temperature levels, humidity, electrical connectivity, power usage and fire alarm conditions are among the items monitored. The system maintains all site documentation for repairs and maintenance performed on each critical piece of equipment covered under our services. The information is useful to our customers in assessing operational efficiency and causes of failure, and enables them to make critical decisions on repair or replacement strategies based on the operating history of the monitored systems.
 
Our facilities maintenance service contracts are typically one to four years in duration with cancellation clauses for nonperformance, and are typically billed annually in advance. Our service contracts take different forms including fixed-price equipment maintenance with optional comprehensive warranty to fix failures, ticket based service with contracted rates in a master service agreement, comprehensive facility services agreements that include on site staffing, scheduled equipment maintenance and nontechnical facility services, and direct contracts for additional moves, add and change work within a facility.
 
As computer density increased and data centers evolved into the use of modular form factors, we found that we could leverage our facilities maintenance experience and infrastructure by offering maintenance service of modules being deployed into new data centers. Our design services continue to evolve to support changing data center requirements. Ultimately, we started working with IT vendors to help them in the design and integration of their IT equipment into modular data centers, which typically leads to ongoing maintenance contracts as these modular systems deploy.
 
Systems Integration Services:
 
To assist our customers with IT-equipment deployment in their data centers we provide what we call “systems integration” services. We provide integrated technology services and software tools designed to accelerate the delivery of complex information technology solutions. These services include custom configuration of a broad scope of information technology products including client products, enterprise products, clusters and modular containers. The integration of this equipment at both a rack-level or modular data center level is performed to our customer specifications and test criteria. We are generally not responsible for the performance of the related equipment in the field. In addition, we provide warehousing of high value equipment such as servers, switches and other information technology hardware that are generally provided on a consignment basis. Occasionally, we will procure and resell the information technology hardware for our customers.
Customers
 
Our customers include IT equipment, technology and service companies, and private sector businesses that in some cases are the end users of the facility or in other cases are providing a facility to a government or commercial end user.
 
Three customers comprised 64% and 65% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing approach emphasizes expertise in information technology hardware systems, energy consumption, real estate matters and facilities planning and operation. This marketing approach allows the customer to contract for comprehensive facilities services or to contract separately for each individual project phase. Our marketing program seeks to capitalize on our industry standing, including our existing relationships and our reputation based on our performance on completed projects. We also seek to enhance our name recognition through the use of trade shows, technical seminars, direct mailings and the media. A key part of our selling strategy is entering into master service agreements with multiple partners and co-selling our range of services to the end-user customers of our partners, leveraging their customer relationships and broadening the scope of potential customers for us.

Our headcount in sales and marketing has fluctuated as we have worked to align the skill sets with our evolving service offering, leverage partner relationships and increase the consultative capability of our sales organization. We have implemented certain marketing activities including investment in an upgraded customer relationship management software to more efficiently manage our sales and marketing activities.
 
Maintaining key alliances is also crucial to sales development and growth and often provides us with introductions to the customers of our alliance partners. These alliances reside with various information technology consulting firms, specialty mission-critical engineering firms, application service providers and internet service providers. Key alliance opportunities also reside in other firms within the market sector such as equipment manufacturers, product suppliers, property management firms, developers, information technology system integrators and firmware providers. We have key strategic alliances with large information technology corporations to provide engineering, design, construction management services, systems integration, modular solutions and facility management services.
 
Competition
 
The mission-critical information technology solutions market is large, fragmented and highly competitive. We compete for contracts based on the strength of our customer relationships, successful past performance record, significant technical expertise, specialized knowledge and broad service offerings. We often compete against divisions of large design and build construction and real estate firms and information technology service and equipment providers of various sizes. Some of these competitors are large, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources than us. In some cases, because of diverse requirements, we frequently collaborate with these and other competitors for large projects. We expect competition in the mission-critical information technology services sector to continue to increase in the future.
 
Because of the breadth of services that we provide, we face many different competitors some of which are our customers or vendors. An example of some of our competitors include the following:
 

· | Data center assessment – CSC, Emerson, large IT OEMS (IBM, HP, etc.) and consulting firms (Accenture, etc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modular data center design and configuration – IO, AST/Schneider, Skanska, Emerson

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modular deployment – McKinstry, Lee Technologies
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Data center facilities and modular maintenance – Lee Technologies, McKinstry, JLL, CBRE
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that, while we face large and small competitors across the spectrum of our service offering, we are uniquely positioned to provide services to IT and facilities across both modular and traditional data center markets. We believe by providing a single source solution focused in the data center market we provide our customers an integrated solution cost effectively.
