ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
Overview
 
ThermoGenesis Holdings, Inc. (“ThermoGenesis Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”) develops, commercializes and markets a range of automated technologies for CAR-T and other cell-based therapies. The Company currently markets a full suite of solutions for automated clinical biobanking, point-of-care applications, and automation for immuno-oncology, including its semi-automated, functionally closed CAR-TXpress™ platform, which streamlines the manufacturing process for the emerging CAR-T immunotherapy market. The Company was founded in 1986 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware and headquartered in Rancho Cordova, CA.
 
The Company previously had two reportable segments, a Device Segment and a Clinical Development Segment. Due to the winding down of the Clinical Development Segment in 2019, the Company no longer has any material revenues or expenses in that segment. As a result, the Company’s chief operating decision maker no longer reviews unconsolidated operating results and the Company no longer reports in two segments. The Company provides the AutoXpress® and BioArchive® platforms for automated clinical bio-banking, PXP® platform for point-of-care cell-based therapies and CAR-TXpress™ platform for bio-manufacturing for immuno-oncology applications. The Company and its subsidiaries currently manufacture and market the following products:

Sales and Distribution Channels 
 
We market and sell our products through independent distributors, except in North America and India, where we sell direct to end-user customers.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses were $2,477,000 and $2,396,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and development activities include expenses associated with the engineering, regulatory, and scientific affairs functions.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
 
We source components for our products from multiple suppliers that manufacture to our engineering specifications. Our high-volume disposable products are manufactured using contract manufacturers. AXP disposable bagsets are manufactured by Viant Medical and our manual processing bagsets are manufactured by Pall Medical Corporation. We utilize our manufacturing facility in Rancho Cordova, California for production of our low volume, high complexity devices. Additionally, in 2019, the Company completed the construction and qualification of an in-house clean room for the assembly of the X-Series disposable cartridges. In 2020, all disposable cartridges were manufactured in this facility. Various raw materials are used to manufacture our products. The raw materials are generally available from multiple sources. We have not had significant difficulty in obtaining necessary raw materials.
Quality System
 
Our quality system is compliant with domestic and international standards and is appropriate for the specific devices we manufacture. Our corporate quality policies govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use. Such policies are intended to ensure that the products we market are safe, effective, and otherwise in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) (21 C.F.R. Part 820) and the applicable rules of other governmental agencies.
 
The Company and its contract manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with the FDA’s QSRs. Compliance requirements relate to manufacturing processes, product testing, documentation control and other quality assurance procedures. Our facilities have undergone International Organization of Standards (“ISO”) 13485:2016 and EU Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) (93/42/EEC) inspections and we have obtained approval to CE-Mark our products. We have received our updated certificate demonstrating compliance to this standard under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”).

Regulatory Scheme and Strategy
 
The development, manufacture and marketing of our cell therapy products are subject to regulation by the FDA as well as the equivalent agencies of other countries including the countries of the European Union and India.
 
We have a quality and regulatory compliance management system that meets the requirements of the ISO 13485: 2003 standard, the FDA’s QSRs, the EU MDD, Canadian Medical Device Regulations (SOR 98-282), and all other applicable local, state, national and international regulations.
 
The FDA regulates medical devices to ensure their safety and efficacy under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C”). Medical devices are defined by language within the FD&C Act which essentially states that a product is considered a medical device if it is intended to provide a diagnosis or basis for treatment. Once a company determines that its product is a medical device, it is required to comply with a number of federal regulations. These include the following:
 

● | 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) approval from the FDA, prior to commercialization (unless the device is classified as “exempt”);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Registration of the company and listing of the medical device with the FDA (within 30 days prior to commercialization);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishment and adherence to the FDA’s labeling requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishment and adherence to the FDA’s Quality Systems and Medical Device Reporting regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA classifies medical devices into three groups: Class I, II or III. These are stratified from lowest to highest safety risk, and regulatory controls increase based on Class.
 
Class I Devices
 Some of our products are considered to pose little or no risk when used as directed and have been deemed by the FDA to be “exempt” from FDA approval or clearance processes prior to commercialization. While pre-marketing FDA review is not mandatory for Exempt Class I medical devices, the manufacturer’s compliance with QSR is nevertheless a requirement.
Class II Devices
 Several of our products, including the BioArchive and the AXP II are categorized as U.S. Class II medical devices and require premarket notification, also known as a section 510(k) clearance, prior to commercialization. Data submitted as part of a 510(k) process must demonstrate a device is “substantially equivalent” with a predicate device that is already on the market. Once 510(k) clearance has been secured, the new medical device may be marketed for its intended use and distributed in the U.S.
Class III Devices
 If a product is considered a Class III device, the FDA approval process is more stringent and time-consuming, and includes the following:
 

● | Extensive pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission and approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application prior to the conduct of a clinical study;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Human clinical studies (or trials) to establish the safety and efficacy of the medical device for the intended use; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission and approval of a PMA application to the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Pre-clinical testing typically involves in vitro laboratory analysis and in vivo animal studies to obtain information related to such things as product safety, feasibility, biological activity and reproducibility. The results of pre-clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IDE application and are reviewed by the Agency before human clinical trials can begin.
 
Higher risk clinical trials conducted inside the U.S. are subject to FDA IDE regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 812), or an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application (21 C.F.R. Part 312). Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., and the data collected therefrom are allowed in accordance with applicable FDA requirements. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time if either believes that study participants may be exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
For certain Class III devices, data generated during product development, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as a PMA application in order to secure approval for commercialization in the U.S. The FDA may deny the approval of a PMA application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and, in some cases, may mandate additional clinical testing. Product approvals, once obtained, can be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA might also require post-marketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and efficacy of a medical device and has the power to forbid or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Information
 Medical device manufacturers must register with the FDA and submit their manufacturing facilities to biennial inspections to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can result in withdrawal of marketing clearances, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or loss of distribution rights. In addition, device manufacturing facilities in the state of California must be registered with the California State Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health and submit to an annual inspection by the State of California to ensure compliance with applicable state regulations. We are also subject to a variety of environmental laws as well as workplace safety, hazardous material, and controlled substances regulations.
 
Also, federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests.
 
Changes in these laws at all levels of government are frequent and could increase our cost of doing business. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, refund payments to the government, lose our licensure or accreditation, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
International Regulatory Requirements
 International regulatory requirements differ somewhat from those of the U.S. In the EU, a single regulatory approval process has been created and approval is represented by CE-Marking. To be able to affix the CE-Mark to our medical devices and distribute them in the EU, we must meet minimum standards for safety and quality (known as the essential requirements) and comply with one or more conformity rules. A notified body assesses our quality management system and compliance with the Medical Device Directive. Marketing authorization can be revoked by the applicable governmental agency or notified body in the event of an unsuccessful quality system annual audit.
 
In India, the regulatory body having oversight of medical devices, therapies, and cell banking is the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (“CDSCO”), and specifically the Drugs Controller General India office. Our marketing and facilities licenses are subject to revocation by the applicable state Drug Controller in Haryana or DCGI.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
We believe that patent protection is important for our products and current and proposed business. We currently have over 35 issued patents globally that will expire at various times between April 2022 and May 2040. The patent positions can be uncertain because they involve interpretation of complex factual information and an evolving legal environment. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced either before or after the patent is issued. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will actually result in an issued patent. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any existing or future patent will provide significant protection or commercial advantage, or that any existing or future patent will not be circumvented by a more basic patent. Generally, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. In addition, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or the first to file a patent application for the subject matter covered by each of our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications.
 
If a third party files a patent application relating to an invention claimed in our patent application, we may be required to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding conducted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine who owns the patent. Such proceeding could involve substantial uncertainties and cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that our patents, if issued, would be upheld as valid in court.
 
Agreements
 
The following are certain material agreements involving our business in effect as of December 31, 2020:

 On August 30, 2019, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement with Corning (the “Supply Agreement”). The Supply Agreement has an initial term of five years with automatic two-year renewal terms, unless terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement (collectively, the “Term”). Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, the Company has granted to Corning exclusive worldwide distribution rights for substantially all X-Series® products under the CAR-TXpress™ platform (the “Products”) manufactured by its subsidiary, ThermoGenesis Corp., for the duration of the Term, subject to certain geographical and other exceptions. In addition, the Company has granted Corning rights of first refusal for the exclusive worldwide distribution of certain future products developed or introduced by the Company relating to cell isolation or cell selection, including any such products substantially related or similar to the Products (the “ROFR Products”). As consideration for the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the Products and ROFR Products, Corning has agreed to pay a $2,000,000 fee, in addition to any amounts payable throughout the Term for the Products and any ROFR Products. The Supply Agreement also contains an option, exercisable by Corning for a period of ninety days following January 1, 2021 to become the manufacturer for all or any portion of the Products. As of December 31, 2020, Corning has not exercised this option. 
 
CBR Systems, Inc. (“CBR”)
 Effective July 13, 2020, the Company entered a Manufacturing and Supply Amending Agreement #2 (the “Amendment”) with CBR Systems, Inc. (“CBR”), an amendment to the Manufacturing Supply Amending Agreement #1 effective March 16, 2020 and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement effective May 15, 2017 (the “CBR Agreement”), which replaced the prior December 31, 2013 Sale and Purchase Agreement in which we agreed to supply CBR with the AXP cord blood processing system and disposables. The term of the CBR Agreement is for three years and will automatically renew in one-year increments unless either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew six months prior to the end of the term. The Amendment, among other things, revised the amount of certain products to be purchased, pricing of those products and removal of the safety stock requirement.
 
In June 2010, we entered into a Technology License and Escrow Agreement (including as an exhibit to the CBR Agreement) in order to alleviate CBR’s concerns about potential long-term supply risk. We are the sole supplier of critical devices and disposables used in the processing of cord blood samples in CBR’s operations. Under the License and Escrow Agreement, we granted CBR a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property necessary for the manufacture of AXP® devices and disposables. The license is for the sole and limited purpose of ensuring continued supply of the AXP and related disposables for use by CBR. The licensed intellectual property is held in escrow and available to CBR only in the event of a default under the License and Escrow Agreement. The Amendment also amended the Technology License Escrow Agreement by updating the financial requirement to exclude convertible debt from the definition of short-term debt. As a result of the Amendment, we will be in default under the Technology License and Escrow Agreement if our cash balance and short-term investments net of non-convertible debt and borrowed funds that are payable within one year are not greater than $1,000,000 at any month end unless such default is cured within thirty (30) days. Upon a default, CBR may take possession of the escrowed intellectual property and initiate manufacturing of the applicable device and disposables. We were in compliance with the License and Escrow Agreement at December 31, 2020.
