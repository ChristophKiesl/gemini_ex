Item 1. Business
Our Company
Dun & Bradstreet is a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics. Our mission is to deliver a global network of trust, enabling clients to transform uncertainty into confidence, risk into opportunity and potential into prosperity. Clients embed our trusted, end-to-end solutions into their daily workflows to inform commercial credit decisions, confirm suppliers are financially viable and compliant with laws and regulations, enhance salesforce productivity and gain visibility into key markets. Our solutions support our clients’ mission critical business operations by providing proprietary and curated data and analytics to help drive informed decisions and improved outcomes.
We are differentiated by the scale, depth, diversity and accuracy of our constantly expanding business database, known as our "Data Cloud," that contains comprehensive information on more than 420 million total businesses as of December 31, 2020. Access to longitudinal curated data is critical for global commerce, and with only a small percentage of the world’s businesses filing public financial statements, our data is a trusted source for reliable information about both public and private businesses. By building such a set of data over time, we were able to establish a unique identifier that creates a single thread connecting related corporate entities allowing our clients to form a holistic view of an enterprise. This unique identifier, which we refer to as the D-U-N-S Number, is a corporate "fingerprint" or "Social Security Number" of businesses. We believe that we are the only scale provider to possess both worldwide commercial credit data and comprehensive public records data that are linked together by a unique identifier allowing for an accurate assessment of public and private businesses globally.
Leveraging our category-defining commercial credit data and analytics, our Finance & Risk solutions are used in the critical decisioning processes of finance, risk, compliance and procurement departments worldwide. We are a market leader in commercial credit decisioning, with many of the top businesses in the world utilizing our solutions to make informed decisions when considering extending business loans and trade credit. We are also a leading provider of data and analytics to businesses looking to analyze supplier relationships and more effectively collect outstanding receivables. We believe our proprietary Paydex score is widely relied upon as an important measure of credit health for businesses. We are well positioned to provide accessible and actionable insights and analytics that mitigate risk and uncertainty, and ultimately protect and drive increased profitability for our clients.
Our Sales & Marketing solutions combine firmographic, personal contact, intent and non-traditional, or alternative data, such as foot traffic, website usage, social media posts, online browsing activity and shipping trackers, to assist clients in optimizing their sales and marketing strategy by cleansing customer relationship management ("CRM") data and narrowing their focus and efforts on the highest probability prospects. As global competition continues to intensify, businesses need assistance with focusing their sales pipelines into a condensed list so that they can have their best sellers target the highest probability return accounts. We provide invaluable insights into businesses that can help our clients grow their businesses in a more efficient and effective manner.
We leverage these differentiated capabilities to serve a broad set of clients across multiple industries and geographies. As of December 31, 2020, we have a global client base of approximately 137,000, including some of the largest companies in the world. For example, in 2020, our client base included approximately 90% of the Fortune 500, approximately 80% of the Fortune 1000 and approximately 70% of the Global 500. Covering nearly all industry verticals, including financial services, technology, communications, government, retail, transportation and manufacturing, our data and analytics support a wide range of use cases. In terms of our geographic footprint, we have an industry-leading presence in North America, a growing presence in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Greater China through our majority or wholly-owned subsidiaries and a broader global presence through our Worldwide Network alliances ("WWN alliances"). On January 8, 2021, we acquired Bisnode Business Information Group AB (“Bisnode”) and expect the acquisition to position us to expand across Europe, increase our client base, and expand and enhance our Data Cloud.
We believe that we have an attractive business model that is underpinned by highly recurring, diversified revenues, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong free cash flow. The proprietary and embedded nature of our data and analytics solutions and the integral role that we play in our clients’ decision-making processes have translated into high client retention and revenue visibility. For example, 21 of our top 25 clients (by size of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been our clients for over 20 years. We also benefit from strong operating leverage given our centralized Data Cloud and solutions, which allow us to generate strong contribution margins and free cash flow.
Our Transformation
Over the course of our history, we have earned the privileged position of leadership and trust within the industries we serve. However, over the past decade, operational and execution issues led to stagnant revenue growth and declining profitability. Identifying an opportunity to unlock Dun & Bradstreet's potential, an investor consortium led by William P. Foley II at Bilcar, LLC ("Bilcar"), Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. ("THL"), Cannae Holdings, Inc. ("Cannae"), Black Knight, Inc. ("Black Knight") and CC Capital Partners, LLC ("CC Capital" and together with Bilcar, THL, Cannae and Black Knight, the 
"Investor Consortium"), acquired Dun & Bradstreet in the Take-Private Transaction (the "Take-Private Transaction"), as described below, in February 2019.
At Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Foley and the rest of the Investor Consortium immediately brought in a new senior leadership team that includes Anthony M. Jabbour as our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Stephen C. Daffron as our President, Bryan T. Hipsher as our Chief Financial Officer, Joe A. Reinhardt III as our Chief Legal Officer and Kevin Coop as our Chief Commercial Officer and subsequently as the President of North America. The senior leadership team brings extensive experience and a proven track record of driving long-term shareholder value creation through transformation and growth initiatives. Together, they identified new leaders for each business unit and corporate support function.
The senior leadership team immediately commenced a comprehensive transformation to improve and revitalize our business for long-term success. They saw significant opportunity to create value by transforming the organization and improving the platform with new business unit leaders, enhanced technology and data, solution innovation and a client-centric go-to-market strategy.
To capitalize on the opportunities identified, we have invested in and continue to invest in strategic initiatives that we believe will allow Dun & Bradstreet to achieve its fullest potential.
Realigning Management and Organization
•We immediately reorganized our management and operating infrastructure into vertically aligned business units to increase focus and accountability. Within each business unit, we then allocated shared corporate functions, such as analytics, data, finance, legal, marketing and communications, operations, people, sales, strategy and technology, to help better understand and drive accountability for the specific revenues and costs associated with each function.
•As a result of this realignment, 18 of the 19 executives, or 95%, and 30 of the 46, or 65%, of members of the broader leadership team are new or in a new role, with nearly half of all employees reporting to a new leader. Our total employee turnover was approximately 1,500 and our leadership was able to identify and eliminate ineffective headcount resulting in a net employee reduction of approximately 850, or 17% of total employees. We also revised our compensation program to incentivize new sales and long-term contracts.
•We will continue to optimize our organizational structure and make targeted hires to build out our team at all levels. We continue to grow our deep roster of data scientists on staff with 84 data scientists as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we believe there are further cost synergies to be realized as we continue to evaluate and implement additional efficiency initiatives.
Optimizing Go-to-Market and Client Service
•We reorganized our salesforce and go-to-market strategy under the leadership of Kevin Coop, our President of North America. Our sales team separates clients into three primary tiers, Enterprise, National and small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs"). Enterprise clients are each managed by a designated team, many of whom work on clients’ premises given the importance of strategic relationships, while National and SMB clients are managed by teams focused on specific solutions and geographies. We revamped our sales commission plans to more appropriately incentivize sales of long-term contracts and the cross-selling of additional solutions rather than focusing on the annual renewal of existing contracts. This go-to-market strategy allows us to better serve clients’ needs, increase cross-sell to existing clients and win new business to drive improved financial outcomes.
•From a client service perspective, we systematically track and monitor service metrics and key service performance indicators to more effectively assist our clients. We implemented a client survey program to track and improve the satisfaction of our clients. Additionally, we improved the offering of self-service tools such as solution guides and online FAQs to automate a portion of our responses to client service inquiries. These investments in the efficiency and efficacy of our client servicing have created net savings by reducing the total volume of client service inquiries and moving client service centers to lower cost areas, and improved our overall client satisfaction.
•Our shift to a client-centric model and go-to-market strategy has translated into positive results.
•We continue to work towards shifting clients from annual to multi-year contracts to drive enhanced visibility and consistency of our cash flows and increase the opportunity to upsell and cross-sell solutions. Driven by the implementation of multi-year incentives, during the year ended December 31, 2020, our client retention rate, reflecting the percentage of prior year revenue from clients who were retained in the current year, remained strong at 96%, and 36% of our business was sold in multi-year contracts. Additionally, the data being collected by our newly instituted programs in tracking and transcribing client service calls should continue to drive improved client service, which should lead to improved client retention.
Simplifying and Scaling Technology
•Technology is key to how we efficiently collect, curate and ultimately deliver our data, analytics and business insights. Under the leadership of our Chief Technology Officer, Gil Shaked, we are continuing to make investments in modernizing our infrastructure and optimizing our architecture to increase control, create efficiencies and greatly enhance the ability of our platforms to scale. To ensure discipline around the capital allocation process, our new management team has instituted a capital committee to validate and approve major technological investments within our business.
•As part of our simplification initiative, we are rationalizing and reducing our overall physical data center footprint and are continuing to transition to a cloud-based solution. We are constantly rationalizing our legacy solutions and decommissioning those that are either not profitable or can be consolidated into our core solutions. We have begun the re-architecture of our technology platform to enhance our ability to organize and process high volumes of disparate data, increase system availability and improve delivery, while lowering our overall cost structure and ensuring information security. As part of this effort, we are in the process of reorienting the delivery of all of our solutions via our centralized Prime platform, which collects the cleansed and curated data from our local and global data supply chains and is designed to feed all of our delivery mechanisms with consistent data.
•We continue to work towards evolving Dun & Bradstreet into a platform with the ability to seamlessly add and integrate new data sets and analytical capabilities into our simplified and scaled technology infrastructure. In 2020, we increased capital investments in capitalized software development focused on enhancing and expanding our data supply chain, innovating new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms via integration, enhanced user interfaces and decreased latency.
Expanding and Enhancing Data
•We have significantly increased our investment in the breadth and depth of our data. We have specifically focused on better utilization of available data, automation of business data research, improvement of identity resolution, expansion of our individual contact database and implementation of tools to monitor and streamline our data supply chain so that we can generate better, more actionable business insights and outcomes for our clients.
•Although we draw from approximately 16,000 proprietary and publicly curated sources, Dun & Bradstreet had historically focused on identifying and collecting a narrow subset of data that was appropriate for specific solutions. We have since reoriented our approach towards better ingesting all available data to effectively leverage previously disregarded sources of data and thereby improve the consistency, accuracy and predictive power of our solutions.
•We are also expanding the volume of the data we are able to offer. We specifically focused on individuals we consider having significant influence over the buying process at companies that are most important to our clients based on our verified usage analysis.
•We are also expanding our coverage of SMBs and incorporating new, alternative data sets to expand the breadth of companies covered and depth of information we are able to provide clients. As part of this initiative we acquired Orb Intelligence ("Orb") in January 2020, which allows us to better capture the digital footprint of businesses as well as the digital exhaust that businesses generate. By incorporating additional data sets into our solutions, we can continue to expand and refine the insights we offer to our clients, which we believe will enhance our competitive advantage.
•We have implemented a data watch program ("Data Watch Program") to proactively monitor and repair issues before clients experience them. Since May 2019, both client issues as well as Data Watch Program issues are now being logged in our data quality repository. We have identified, logged and resolved a number of issues as a direct result of this initiative and are continuously working to address additional issues.
Strengthening Analytics and Insights
•We have strengthened our analytics by leveraging our artificial intelligence ("AI") capabilities and expanded data sets and growing our analytics team. We accelerated these efforts through our acquisition of Lattice Engines, Inc. ("Lattice"), which has significantly improved our analytics and connectivity within our Sales & Marketing solutions. As a leading customer data platform, Lattice centralizes first- and third-party data collection on client and prospect profiles leveraging an AI data platform to deliver tailored insights that help clients scale their account-based marketing programs across all channels.
•Improvements in analytics are enabling us to create solutions that produce greater insights and more predictive results. For example, we recently introduced a new set of solutions for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") that provides predictive modeling of disaster outcomes to support response efforts. We now also offer clients access to D&B Analytics Studio, a configurable cloud sandbox environment where they can develop and test their own analytics in-house using our data combined with other internal data and external vendor data that has been linked through the D-U-N-S Number identification.

•We will continue to expand the use cases for our analytics to find new and innovative ways to serve our clients. Enhanced analytics enable us to provide easy to implement end-to-end solutions that can be used by a wide range of clients, including SMBs that do not have the resources to support a full data analytics staff. By creating configurable, rather than customizable, analytics solutions, we believe that we can increase the adoption of solutions by our clients and expand the size of our client base.
Our transformation strategy is based on a proven playbook of enhancing shareholder value through organizational re-alignment and re-investment and is well underway. As of December 31, 2020, these initiatives have resulted in approximately $241 million of net annualized run-rate savings, and we believe there are incremental opportunities to further rationalize our cost structure. In light of the changes that have been made or identified by our experienced operator-driven Investor Consortium and seasoned management team, we believe we are well-positioned to execute on our near- and long-term strategy of driving shareholder value through consistent revenue growth, managing cost initiatives and innovating and improving the way we add value and solve the increasingly challenging and complex needs of our clients.
On July 6, 2020, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 90,047,612 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. Immediately subsequent to the closing of the IPO, we also completed a private placement of 18,458,700 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to 98.5% of the IPO price, or $21.67 per share. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a more detailed discussion of the IPO and concurrent private placement.
Our Market Opportunity
Businesses rely on B2B data and analytics providers to extract data-driven insights and make better decisions. For example, in commercial lending and trade credit, the scarcity of readily available credit history makes the extension of credit a time-consuming and imprecise process. In procurement, businesses face increasingly complex and global supply chains, making the assessment of compliance and viability of all suppliers prohibitively difficult and expensive if not conducted effectively. In sales and marketing, businesses have benefited from the proliferation of CRM, Marketing Automation and Sales Acceleration tools designed to help identify, track and improve both customer management and prospecting growth activities. While these tools are helping to fill sales funnels and improve the progression of opportunities, key challenges remain in salesforce productivity, effective client segmentation and marketing campaign activation. Common stumbling blocks include incorrect, or outdated, contact information, duplicated or inaccurate firmographic data and a lack of synchronization between the various platforms in the marketing technology ecosystem.
We help our clients solve these mission critical business problems. We believe the total addressable market ("TAM") in which we operate is large, growing and significantly under penetrated. We participate in the big data and analytics software market, as defined by Interactive Data Corporation ("IDC"), which represents a collection of software markets that functionally address decision support and decision automation. This market includes business intelligence and analytics tools, analytic data management and integration platforms and analytics and performance management applications. Within the broader market of data and analytics solutions, we serve a number of different markets, including the commercial credit data, sales and marketing data and Governance, Risk and Compliance ("GRC") markets to provide clients with decisioning support and automation. As we continue to drive innovation in our solutions, we expect to address a greater portion of this TAM as new use cases for our data assets and analytical capabilities are introduced.
We believe there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment generating additional growth in our TAM and increasing the potential demand for our solutions:
•Growing Recognition of Analytics and Data-Informed Business Decisioning. Due to the pervasive digital transformation that nearly all industries are experiencing, businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of incorporating data-driven insights into their organizations. Businesses are leveraging the advancements of technology in data creation and interpretation to analyze business practices with the aim of improving efficiency, reducing risk and driving growth. We expect companies will continue to recognize the value in relying on insightful and accurate B2B data in their finance and credit decisioning, regulatory and compliance and sales and marketing workflows.
•Growth in Data Creation and Applications. As a result of the increasing recognition of data’s value, the volume of data sets being collected and assembled today is increasing. Not only is the size of these data sets larger than ever, but also the data being collected covers a wider range of topics and subjects. Driven in large part by the global trend of an "Internet of Things," the proliferation of mobile phones and connected devices has created a "digital exhaust" of data that can be captured and tracked. This alternative data can be incorporated in predictive models alongside traditional data to provide more sophisticated and accurate business insights. Businesses now have a massive amount of data at their fingertips but often have to rely on large scale providers to help them curate, match, append and create insights in order to convert that data into improved outcomes.
•Advances in Analytical Capabilities Unlocking the Value of Data. The combination of increasingly available data sets with effective artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities allows for the generation of mission critical insights integrated into clients’ workflows. Businesses that lack the resources for developing these complex tools and solutions internally turn to data and analytics providers, creating market demand. The availability of more insightful analytical tools, in turn, drives growing recognition of the power of analytics in everyday business processes.
•Heightened Compliance Requirements in an Evolving Regulatory Environment for Business. Businesses today are under intense scrutiny to comply with an ever-expanding and evolving set of data regulatory requirements, which can vary by geography and industry served. Performing adequate diligence on clients and suppliers can be cumbersome and dampen the pace of business expansion, or worse, leave a business exposed to expensive fines and penalties. Regulations such as the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, Office of Foreign Assets Control's ("OFAC’s"), Anti-Money Laundering Policy and the United States Department of Justice Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") require businesses to take the necessary steps to comply in an efficient manner. Recently, regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") have also introduced complexity into the collection and use of data by businesses. Manual processes are burdensome and prone to human error, and therefore demand for data and analytics as a solution continues to increase.
As a leading provider of data and analytics, we have witnessed the emergence and development of these trends firsthand. We believe that due to our differentiated capabilities and our privileged position as a tenured incumbent, we are well positioned to capture this market opportunity and benefit from these long-term trends.
Our Solutions
The defining characteristic of our solutions is the breadth and depth of our combined proprietary and curated public data and actionable analytics that help drive informed decisions for our clients. As of December 31, 2020, our Data Cloud is compiled from approximately 16,000 sources, as well as from data collected by our 15 WWN alliances, resulting in data sourced from 243 countries and territories worldwide. We believe that we are uniquely able to match data to its corresponding entity, and have extensive related intellectual property with approximately 132 of our 232 patents dedicated to this function. Our capabilities in matching and identity resolution enable us to make sense of our vast universe of data, turning chaos into order. Since 1963, we have tracked these businesses by assigning unique identifiers (known as a D-U-N-S Number) to all companies in our data set. The D-U-N-S Number is recommended and, in many cases required, by over 240 commercial, trade and government organizations. This privileged position in the market has allowed us to commercialize the creation and monitoring of D-U-N-S Numbers by suppliers, which in turn feeds additional proprietary data into our platform.
Data is only valuable when it drives action that moves an organization towards its goals. Underpinned by an integrated technology platform, our solutions derive data-driven insights that help clients target, grow, collect, procure and comply. We provide clients with both curated bulk data to incorporate into their internal workflows and end-to-end solutions that generate insights from this data through configurable analytics. The chart below illustrates the comprehensive, end-to-end nature of our solutions, which are organized into two primary areas: Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing.
Finance & Risk
Our Finance & Risk solutions are mission critical to our clients as they seek to leverage the data sets and analytics from our platform to manage risk, minimize fraud and monitor their supply chain. Top commercial enterprises in the world utilize our configurable solutions to make better decisions when considering small business loans, extending trade credit, analyzing supplier relationships and collecting outstanding receivables. Our Finance & Risk solutions help clients increase cash flow and profitability while mitigating credit, operational and regulatory risks by helping them answer questions such as:
•Does my business credit file reflect the true health of my business?
•Will this customer pay me on time?
•How can I prioritize and automate my collections process?
•How can I automate credit decisions across my portfolio?
•How do I accelerate Know Your Customer ("KYC") / Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") due diligence while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements?

Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership with the Most Comprehensive Commercial Credit Database
We are the category-defining player in the market for B2B credit decisioning data and analytics. We believe our long operating history uniquely qualifies and positions us to address the commercial data-driven decisioning needs of our clients due to the breadth and depth of our proprietary Data Cloud. Our Data Cloud includes more than 420 million businesses globally and extends far beyond those for which data is publicly available. The D-U-N-S Number is a widely recognized identifier and is a policy-driven requirement for the process of supplying trade credit for many businesses and governments. Our owned, proprietary data sets include commercial credit and firmographic data, personal contact data, regulatory compliance, receivables, payment history and other data. Our strategic relationships with our global WWN alliances provide us with international data in our global Data Cloud, which we view as a key competitive strength in serving both U.S. and international businesses. The contributory nature of our Data Cloud, where we typically obtain updated information at little or no cost and own most of our data, creates a strong network effect that we believe gives us an expanding competitive advantage over other market participants or potential entrants. Our Data Cloud is also differentiated in our ability to track corporate linkages of child-to-parent organization relationships and define universal beneficial ownership across entities to help clients better understand commercial relationships and make better informed decisions with a more holistic view of the business. As noted by industry research firm Outsell, Inc., "D&B will remain the global leader in the trade credit space due to its ability to drive applicability with D-U-N-S, which remains an industry standard."
Innovative Analytics and Decisioning Capabilities Driving End-to-End Solutions
In a world of increasing data access, the value proposition for companies like ours is shifting from the provision of core data to the generation of analytical insights to inform decisioning processes and optimize workflows, across interrelated business activities. Our end-to-end solutions cover a comprehensive spectrum of use cases across the lifecycle of our clients’ businesses. These use cases continue to evolve as we find additional ways to derive insights from our data. We believe our configurable solutions, in combination with our proprietary Data Cloud, are a key competitive advantage for us and allow us to effectively compete across the entire commercial data and analytics landscape.
Deep Relationships with Blue Chip Clients
With our leading data and analytical insights, we serve many of the largest enterprises in the world, including approximately 90% of the businesses in the Fortune 500, approximately 80% of the Fortune 1000 and approximately 70% of the Global 500 during 2020. Our client base is diversified across size, industry and geography and features minimal concentration. In 2020 and 2019, no client accounted for more than 5% of our revenue, and our top 50 clients accounted for approximately 25% of our revenue. We have held relationships with 21 of our top 25 clients by size of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for more than 20 years, which reflects how deeply embedded we are in their daily workflows and decisioning processes. For both 2020 and 2019, our annual revenue retention rate was 96%.
Scalable and Highly Attractive Financial Profile
We have an attractive business model underpinned by stable and highly recurring revenues, significant operating leverage and low capital requirements that contribute to strong free cash flow. Our high levels of client retention and shift toward multi-year subscription contracts result in a high degree of revenue visibility. The vast majority of our revenues are either recurring or re-occurring in nature. Additionally, we benefit from natural operating leverage given the high contribution margins associated with incremental revenue generated from our centralized Data Cloud and solutions. Despite the investments being made to enhance our technology, analytics and data, our capital requirements remain minimal with capital expenditures (including
capitalized software development costs) of approximately 7% of our revenues in 2020. All of these factors contribute to strong free cash flow generation, allowing us the financial flexibility to invest in the business and pursue growth through acquisitions.
World Class Management Team with Depth of Experience and Track Record of Success
Our senior management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in both the markets we serve and in transforming similar businesses. The previous Dun & Bradstreet management team has been almost completely replaced with an experienced and energized group of senior executives who have spent years leading businesses in the vertical software and data and analytics sectors. Our senior executives have successfully worked together in architecting previous turnaround stories and delivering consistent growth both organically and through acquiring and integrating businesses. Our management team operates under the leadership of Mr. Foley, who has a long, successful history of acquiring, reorganizing and transforming companies by rationalizing cost structures, investing in growth and onboarding and mentoring senior management. Beyond our senior management team, we are focused on attracting and retaining the strongest talent at all levels throughout the organization.
Our Growth Strategy
Enhance Existing Client Relationships
We believe our current client base presents a large opportunity for growth through enhanced cross selling in order to capture more of our clients’ data and analytics spend. As an end-to-end provider of commercial data and analytics, we believe that there are significant opportunities to have clients buy from a consistent, single-source provider and to increase their interaction with our platform. Although our strategic clients used approximately six of our solutions on average, and we are improving our average solutions per client ratio, our overall client base used less than two of our solutions on average as of December 31, 2020. While there is still room to add additional products to our strategic client base, which represents less than 1% of our total client base, we believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the number of solutions per client in the remainder of our client base. Our new go-to-market strategy will enable us to increase the number of touchpoints with key decision makers within any given client and allow us to identify and sell the right solutions to each decision maker’s respective department. By focusing on enhancing the quality of our data and analytics, we will be able to produce more valuable insights, increasing client engagement across our existing solutions and driving clients towards new, innovative solutions.
Win New Clients in Targeted Markets
We believe that there is substantial opportunity to grow our client base. While we have significant market share in the enterprise and mid-market, there continues to be opportunity to win new clients. There are several instances where we have built a successful long-term enterprise client relationship with a particular company, but its competitors are not our clients. Our focus is to leverage our best practices from serving one company and articulate the value to similar companies that may benefit from our solutions and experience.
We also believe there is significant opportunity to expand our presence in the SMB market. We currently serve approximately 90,000 SMB clients out of the millions of businesses within the global marketplace. In addition, we are servicing over 1,000 businesses a day on average that seek our solutions and D-U-N-S Number and have over 1,000,000 businesses leveraging our business credit and insights.  We have existing relationships with many SMBs through solutions enabling the proactive monitoring of their D-U-N-S Number. However, we have not historically capitalized on the opportunity to cross-sell them into our solutions. We are rolling out our Marketplace, an integrated web platform that will provide these businesses with an introduction to Dun & Bradstreet’s capabilities and solutions for their potential use. By leveraging this go-to-market channel 
and offering more simplified solutions that are easily integrated into client workflows, we can continue to expand our reach among SMBs.
Develop Innovative Solutions
Given the depth and coverage of information contained in our proprietary Data Cloud, we believe we can continue to develop differentiated solutions to serve our clients in an increasing number of use cases. As we continue to gather and incorporate additional sources of data, the resulting analytics and insights we are able to provide within our solutions will be increasingly impactful to our clients and their decisioning processes. By improving the quality and breadth of our Data Cloud, we will be able to expand into adjacent use cases and leverage our data insights in new functional areas such as collections, fraud and capital markets. We will also be able to identify and further penetrate attractive addressable markets, as demonstrated by the development of our Risk & Compliance solutions, a high growth area within our Finance & Risk solutions, in order to better address the GRC market. These additional solutions utilize existing data architecture to generate high contribution incremental revenue streams.
Expand Our Presence in Attractive International Markets
Despite our global presence and industry leading position in the North American market, we remain relatively under-penetrated in international markets, with International revenue accounting for less than 20% of our business in 2020. We believe that expanding our presence in owned international markets can be a significant growth driver for us in the coming years. Our international growth strategy begins with localizing current solutions to meet global demand and, similar to our domestic strategy, includes a focus on cross-selling and upselling, winning new clients and developing innovative solutions. On January 8, 2021, we acquired Bisnode. We expect the acquisition will position us to rapidly expand across the Scandinavian, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and central European countries.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
While the core focus of our strategy is to grow organically, we believe there are strategic acquisition opportunities that may allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base, increase the breadth and depth of our data sets and further strengthen our solutions. We believe there are attractive synergies that result from acquiring small companies that provide innovative solutions and integrating these solutions into our existing offerings to generate cross-selling and upselling opportunities across our existing client base, as demonstrated by our recent success of integrating Lattice, coAction.com and Orb. Additionally, there are potential cost synergies that could result from integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating platform. Our leadership team has a proven track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating companies to drive long-term value creation, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pursuing acquisitions.
Our Clients
We have a diversified client base with approximately 137,000 clients worldwide, including approximately 90% of the Fortune 500, approximately 80% of the Fortune 1000 and approximately 70% of the Global 500 during 2020.
Our client base is diversified across size, industry and geography, and features minimal concentration; with no client accounting for more than 5% of revenue and our top 50 clients accounting for approximately 25% of revenue. Our clients include enterprises across nearly all industry verticals, including financial services, technology, communications, retail, transportation and manufacturing, and our data and analytics support use cases of all types. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from companies in the financial services industry. We have held relationships with 21 of our top 25 clients by size of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more than 20 years, which reflects how deeply embedded we are in their daily workflows and decisioning processes. For 2020, our annual revenue retention rate, reflecting the percentage of prior year revenue from clients who were retained in the current year, was 96%.
In addition to our blue chip corporate client base, we serve a number of government organizations. Through the development of our analytics, we continue to move into mission critical functions with higher applicability across federal, state and local government organizations.
We have a presence in 243 countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greater China and India as of December 31, 2020. Our international presence is organized through the WWN alliances and owned markets. The following table presents the contribution by geography to revenue, which excludes Corporate and other:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Revenue by geography | | | | | 
North America | 83 | % | | 83 | % | 83 | %
International | 17 | % | | 17 | % | 17 | %

Go-to-Market Organization
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on both generating new clients as well as cross-selling and upselling our end-to-end solutions to existing clients. Our salesforce is segmented into three distinct categories: strategic sales, field sales and inside sales. To more effectively align our salesforce with our clients, we have also organized these distribution channels into geographic territories supported by specialized sales support and centralized sales development teams.
Our strategic sales team covers our largest and most sophisticated clients who typically use multiple D&B solutions across a variety of use cases. These strategic clients are each independently managed by directors who own the client relationship and are equipped to sell all solutions. In many instances, we deploy our employees on-site to assist our clients in implementing and configuring our analytics for various use cases, acting as a "one-stop shop" for our clients’ data and analytics needs.
Our field sales team is geographically distributed and promotes both our Finance & Risk solutions and Sales & Marketing solutions, largely targeting clients with revenues in excess of $250 million. Clients in this grouping typically buy only one of our solutions, and there is ample opportunity to expand the depth of our relationships as we continue to educate and train our sales professionals on selling our full suite of solutions.
Lastly, our inside sales team is focused on all other businesses that are not covered by our other direct sales channels in the emerging and micro business segments. Our specialized sales support and subject matter experts are consolidated in a shared services organization and support all channels as needed. In addition, we are building a sales development representative organization that supports lead generation of our sales teams.
In addition to our direct go-to-market efforts, we also sell through our network of strategic alliances to jointly deliver our data and analytics to our mutual clients. This indirect channel is centrally managed collaboratively within the sales organization and also has responsibility for coordinating all global WWN and owned markets to ensure consistency of approach and account management for our global clients.
Given the breadth of our end-to-end solutions and increased focus on cross-selling, we have spent considerable time training and upskilling our salesforce in a formal sales training program. We now require sales certifications from our salesforce and have instituted talent assessments and mid-year performance check-ins to ensure we continue to shape our culture to winning and accountability.
We have also redesigned our sales compensation plans to incentivize multi-year contracting and cross-selling rather than one-year deals that are renewed each year. This has reinvigorated our salesforce and produced demonstrable results in the number and volume of multi-year contracts being sold today.
Both our Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing solutions are generally licensed via a master agreement or online terms and conditions with corresponding product specific terms that are either in separate order forms or are incorporated into the online terms and conditions. The master agreement and online terms cover high level topics such as license rights and restrictions, confidentiality, data protection and privacy, audit rights, warranties and disclaimers, intellectual property ownership, and termination rights. In some cases, order forms will include the product specific terms such as the solutions being licensed, the specifications, access levels and entitlements for those solutions, pricing and payment terms. Master agreements are typically evergreen and allow orders to be executed on an ongoing basis and online terms are either annual or have a duration equal to the order to which they relate. Order forms may be for one-year or multi-year periods. Most products and solutions are subject to auto-renewal provisions. Master agreements can be terminated for breach by either party, generally after a 15-60 day cure period. Approximately 79% and 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was generated from solutions provided pursuant to fixed price subscriptions.
International Presence
We have operated internationally for over 160 years and benefit from an extensive network and strong global brand recognition. We have an operating framework of owned, majority-controlled and partnered / franchised markets that serve international clients and secure critical global data to support both our United States and international clients. Across all international markets, we leverage our unique data sets and solutions to serve our clients’ Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing needs.
There are certain key international markets in which we operate independently or through joint ventures, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Greater China. As we continue to provide international companies with our best-in-class data on U.S. companies, suppliers and prospects, our solutions have also increasingly become localized in recent years to better serve foreign markets. Our local presence ensures the complete, timely and accurate collection of commercial information. We expect that the acquisition of Bisnode on January 8, 2021 will position us to further strengthen and expand our presence across Europe.
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we also operated through 15 WWN alliances. Our partners license our data and technology, as well as our trademarks and brand, to serve local markets on behalf of Dun & Bradstreet. Our extensive international network enables millions of executives around the world to make confident business decisions with reliable and accessible information. Our strategic relationships with our global WWN alliances provide us with best-in-class breadth of international data in our Data Cloud, which we view as a key competitive strength in serving international enterprises. This approach has improved the applicability of our data to local clients, while enlarging and strengthening the data sets for clients in all geographies.
Competition
We primarily compete on the basis of differentiated data sets, analytical capabilities, solutions, client relationships, innovation and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories across both our Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing solutions. Our competitors vary based on the client size and geographical market that our solutions cover.
For our Finance & Risk solutions, our competition generally varies by client size between enterprise, mid-market and SMBs. Dun & Bradstreet has a leading presence in the enterprise market as clients place a high degree of value on our best-in-class commercial credit database to inform their critical decisions around the extension of credit. Dun & Bradstreet’s main competitors in the enterprise and mid-market include Bureau van Dijk (owned by Moody’s Corporation) in Europe and Equifax and Experian in North America. In the SMB market, commercial credit health becomes increasingly tied to consumer credit health. Our competition in this market generally includes Equifax, Experian and other consumer credit providers that offer commercial data. Additionally, there is a fragmented tail of low cost, vertical and regionally focused point solutions in this market that may be attractive to certain clients but lack the scale and coverage breadth to compete holistically.
For our Sales & Marketing solutions, our competition has historically been very fragmented with many players offering varying levels of data quantity and quality, and with data being collected in ways that may cross ethical and privacy boundaries. Dun & Bradstreet strives to protect the data and privacy of clients and to maintain the highest standards in the ethical acquisition, aggregation, curation and delivery of data. Our direct competitors vary depending on use cases, such as market segmentation, digital marketing lead generation, lead enrichment, sales effectiveness and data management. In the market for contact data, our competition generally includes, ZoomInfo and a few consultancies building bespoke solutions. For other sales and marketing solutions such as customer data platform, visitor intelligence, audience targeting and intent data, we face a number of smaller competitors.
Overall, outside North America, the competitive environment varies by region and country, and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments, availability of data and local business preferences.
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, our direct competition for our Finance & Risk solutions is primarily from Bureau van Dijk, Creditsafe and Experian. Additionally, the Sales & Marketing solutions landscape in these markets is both localized and fragmented, where numerous local players of varying sizes compete for business.
In Asia Pacific, we face competition in our Finance & Risk solutions from a mix of local and global providers. We compete with Sinotrust International Information & Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd., in China and local competitors in India. In addition, as in the United Kingdom, the Sales & Marketing solutions landscape throughout Asia is localized and fragmented.
We believe that the solutions we provide to our clients in all geographies reflect our deep understanding of our clients’ businesses, the differentiated nature of our data and the quality of our analytics and decisioning capabilities. The integration of our solutions into our clients’ mission critical workflows helps to ensure long-lasting relationships, efficiency and continuous improvement.
Technology
Technology is key to how we efficiently collect, curate and ultimately deliver our data, actionable analytics and business insights to make investments in modernizing our infrastructure and optimizing our architecture to increase control, create efficiencies and greatly enhance the ability of our platforms to scale. We have begun the re-architecture of our technology platform to enhance our ability to organize and process high volumes of disparate data, increase system availability and improve delivery, while lowering our overall cost structure and ensuring information security. We continue to work towards evolving Dun & Bradstreet into a platform with the ability to seamlessly add and integrate new data sets and analytical capabilities into our simplified and scaled technology infrastructure.
Intellectual Property
We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, patents and applications to the foregoing. These rights, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We also believe that the Dun & Bradstreet name and related trade names, marks and logos are of material importance to our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software, analytics, algorithms, inventions and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, etc.) and contractual safeguards for protecting them throughout the world.
We own patents and patent applications both in the United States and in other selected countries of importance to us. The patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies and inventions which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection. We believe that the protection of our innovative technology and inventions, such as our proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution, through the filing of patent applications, is a prudent business strategy. Filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology. However, these patents and/or patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third-parties and later asserted against us. Where appropriate, we may also consider asserting, or cross-licensing, our patents.
Workforce and Human Capital Resources
Dun & Bradstreet is committed to creating a passionate, outside-in, forward-leaning culture. We want Dun & Bradstreet to be the best place to work and one that attracts and retains the very best talent. We strive to make our company a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace that will drive personal growth for each of our employees. We design our human resources programs to support these critical objectives. We provide a total rewards package that includes a comprehensive compensation and benefits package designed to support our employees, both at home and at work. We provide learning and development programs for our people to prepare them for their roles and facilitate internal career mobility aiming at creating a high-performing workforce. Our diversity and inclusion programs further enhance our culture with the goal of making our workplace more engaging and inclusive. Our “Corporate Citizenship / Do Good” program is designed to give back to our communities where we live and work, and to support worthy causes around the world. This program further enhances the interaction of our employees at all levels.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented operational changes with the primary objective to provide safety to our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and to comply with government regulations. We have adopted a distributed workforce model, including for some employees, a long-term, full-time work from home arrangement, while implementing additional safety measures for employees and contractors continuing essential and critical on-site work.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,039 employees worldwide, of whom 2,618 were in our North America segment and Corporate, and 1,421 were in our International segment. Our workforce also engages third-party consultants as an ongoing part of our business where appropriate. There are no unions in our U.S. or Canadian operations, and work councils and trade unions represent a small portion of our employees outside of the United States and Canada. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe we maintain strong relations with our employees.
Financial Information by Segment
In addition to our two reportable segments, we have a corporate organization that consists primarily of general and administrative expenses that are not included in the other segments. For financial information by reporting segment, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulatory Matters
Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority for us. This includes compliance, to the extent applicable, with national and local privacy and data protection laws and regulations, anti-corruption laws, export control laws, antitrust/competition laws, and national laws regulating enterprise credit reporting agencies. These laws are enforced by national and local regulatory agencies, and in some instances also through private civil litigation.
We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through a dedicated legal and compliance team situated in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, and China, all reporting to the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer at our U.S. headquarters. Through the legal and compliance functions, we promulgate compliance policies and procedures, provide training to our associates, have a third-party compliance program, monitor all material laws and regulations, monitor and audit the efficacy of our internal compliance-related controls, assist in the development of new products and services, and meet as necessary and appropriate with regulators and legislators to establish transparency of our operations and create a means to understand and react should any issues arise.
Data and Privacy Protection and Regulation
Our operations are subject to applicable national and local laws that regulate privacy, data/cyber security, broader data collection and use, cross-border data transfers and/or business credit reporting. These laws impact, among other things. data collection, usage, storage, security and breach, dissemination (including transfer to third parties and cross-border), retention and destruction. Certain of these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for violations. The laws and regulations that affect our business include, but are not limited to:
•the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive and implementing national legislation, and judicial and regulatory developments on the EU and national level, including the recent Schrems decision and EDPB guidances;
•U.S. federal, state and local data protections laws such as the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTC Act") and similar state laws, state data breach laws and state privacy laws, such as the CCPA and the recently adopted CPRA;
•China’s Cybersecurity Law and other civil and criminal laws relating to data protection;
•other international data protection, data localization, and state secret laws impacting us or our data suppliers; and
•oversight by regulatory authorities for engaging in business credit reporting such as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and People’s Bank of China.
We are also subject to federal and state laws impacting marketing such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and state unfair or deceptive practices acts.
These laws and regulations, which generally are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information available in the marketplace, are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We already incur significant expenses in our attempt to ensure compliance with these laws. Currently, public concern is high with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies in the United States, as well as the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, financial information, medical information, department of motor vehicle data and behavioral data. In addition, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, legislatures and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy and have become increasingly concerned with the use of these types of personal information. As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. Additional legislative or regulatory efforts in the United States could further regulate the collection, use, communication, access, accuracy, obsolescence, sharing, correction and security of this personal information. In addition, any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.
