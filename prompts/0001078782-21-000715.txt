ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(A) BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
 
Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Florida corporation on March 5, 1999 under the name of B Twelve, Inc.. In August, 2002, the Company changed its name from B Twelve, Inc. to Kyto BioPharma Inc. and in May 2018, the name was changed again to Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc.. In July 2019, the Company was re-incorporated as a Delaware company. The Company operates virtually, from public locations or the homes of its officers, and does not currently lease any office space.
 
The Company was originally formed to acquire and develop proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases and had been evaluating a number of strategies. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had accumulated a deficit of $32,380,746 from all prior operations. In April 2018, the Board adopted a new business plan focused on the development of early stage technology and life science businesses through early stage investment funding. The Company has recruited a number of experienced investment consultants from a network that includes angel investors, corporate managers, sophisticated early stage investors and successful entrepreneurs with experience across a number of technology and life science products and markets, and relies on input from these advisors in conducting due diligence and making investment decisions. In order to offset the risk in early-stage investing, the Company works with angel investment groups and other sophisticated investors and participates only after these groups have completed due diligence and committed to invest, in effect becoming lead investors. The Company then completes its own due diligence and invests under identical terms as the lead investors. The Company will do follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies, assuming adequate progress, when portfolio companies initiate new financing rounds. The Company currently does not typically invest more than $250,000 in any single investment. Generally, the Company’s investments represent less than 5% ownership interests, and the Company therefore has no effective control or influence over the management or commercial decisions of the companies in which it invests. The Company plans to generate revenue from realized gains from the sale of the businesses in which it has invested, or some or all of its shareholdings in those cases where portfolio companies go public. Generally, it is expected that investments will be realized from an exit within a period of four years following initial investment. Such exits or liquidity events are outside the Company’s control and depend on merger and acquisition (“M&A”) transactions or an initial public offering (“IPO”) which may result in cash or equity proceeds. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast revenue, net income, and cash flow. Other than making its initial and, potentially, follow-on investments in its portfolio companies, the Company does not provide any financial support to any of its investees.
 
The Company has one regular employee – the CEO. Prior to December 31, 2020 the chief executive officer, Paul Russo, of Kyto Technology and Life Science, Inc. was acting as a consultant to the Company and did not receive contractual compensation for his services in the form of cash. For the year ended March 31, 2021 he was granted 215,000 stock options, and an ex-gratia bonus of $210,000. As of January 1, 2021, Mr. Russo was engaged as an employee of the Company at a salary of $400,000 per annum of which 60% is paid monthly, and the balance deferred to be paid once the Company lists and starts trading on the Nasdaq exchange. The full terms of Mr. Russo’s employment are described in an engagement letter filed on Form 8K on February 1, 2021, incorporated by reference herein, which was approved by the Compensation committee of the Board of Directors on that date.
 
The Company has created a portfolio of minority investments in early-stage start-up companies and derives its revenue opportunity from the sale of those investments. Such sales are outside the Company’s control and depend on M&A transactions or IPOs which may result in cash or equity proceeds. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast revenue, net income, and cash flow. 
As of the date of this filing, the Company had approximately $400,000 of cash to cover its operating expenses, and new investment requirements and is continuing to raise additional funding on a recurring monthly basis. If successful, it will have sufficient funding for further investments and ongoing operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient cash to cover its requirements on attractive terms, if at all, and whether it will be able to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Stay at home orders and general economic uncertainties arising out of the current Covid-19 epidemic have created additional delays and uncertainty. To date there has been no disruption to the Company’s business operations, although some of its portfolio investment companies report delays in their programs.
 
At March 31, 2020, management determined that the Company was an investment company for purposes of ASC 946 disclosure, and committed to follow the specialized accounting and reporting guidance contained therein. Accordingly, a new company, Kyto Investments, Inc. (“KI”) was incorporated in Delaware in December 2020 in preparation for a restructuring and an N-2 Registration Statement filed in March 2021 for review by the SEC. KI is an internally managed, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Immediately upon effectiveness of this N-2 Registration Statement, the Company will merge with KI and the Company will be the surviving entity. As of the completion of the merger, the Company will constitute a “successor issuer” for the purposes of Rule 414 under the Securities Act and may continue the current offering by filing post-effective amendments to the Registration Statements. Prior to the merger, the Company had fewer than 100 non affiliated investors and filed under the 1934 Act relying on exemption Rule 3( c ) (1).

As a BDC, the Company will be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. The Company also intends to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a RIC, the Company is required to comply with additional regulatory requirements. The Company has prepared and submitted sequentially two N-2 Registration Statements to the SEC for review but has not yet received final approval of its registration as at the filing date of this report.
