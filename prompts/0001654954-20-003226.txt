  Material Reclassification, Merger, Consolidation, or Purchase or Sale of Significant Assets
  
  Sale of Assets to California Cryobank Stem Cell Services LLC
  
 On February 7, 2018, the Company announced that it entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 6, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”), with California Cryobank Stem Cell Services LLC (“FamilyCord”). The sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets pursuant to the Purchase Agreement was completed on May 17, 2018.
  
 Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, FamilyCord acquired from CBAI substantially all of the assets of CBAI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and assumed certain liabilities of CBAI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The sale did not include CBAI’s cash and certain other excluded assets and liabilities. FamilyCord agreed to pay a purchase price of $15,500,000 in cash at closing with $3,000,000 of the purchase price deposited into escrow to secure CBAI’s indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
  
 The Purchase Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type and nature. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, CBAI indemnified FamilyCord for breaches of its representations and warranties, breaches of covenants, losses related to excluded assets or excluded liabilities and certain other matters. The representations and warranties set forth in the Purchase Agreement generally survive for two years following the closing.
  
  CBAI previously disclosed that it anticipates distributing proceeds from the FamilyCord sale to shareholders. On February 11, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan of dissolution (the “Plan”) that is subject to shareholder approval. If the Company’s shareholders approve the Plan, the Company presently intends to make an initial distribution of at least $0.0048 per share of common stock as promptly as reasonably possible thereafter. Based on the information currently available to it, the Company is unable to estimate the aggregate amount which will ultimately be distributed to its shareholders. The actual amounts of any distributions may vary substantially, depending on, among other things, whether the Company becomes subject to any additional liabilities or claims, including potential claims for indemnification relating to sales of the Company’s assets, whether the Company incurs unexpected or greater than expected losses with respect to contingent liabilities, the extent to which the Company is able to monetize any remaining non-cash assets and any future amounts received by the Company in connection with, among other things, all future amounts received by the Company, including the amount of FamilyCord sale proceeds to be released from escrow upon the termination of the escrow in May 2020 CBAI and its Board of Directors continue to contemplate a distribution, given the Company’s expenses and other contingencies the total proceeds ultimately paid out to shareholders will be significantly less than the gross purchase price the Company received from its Purchase Agreement with FamilyCord.
  
  BioCells Acquisition and Subsequent Sale
  
 In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina (“BioCells”), providing for the Company’s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells (the “Shares).
  
 On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.

The Company received the settlement payment on November 15, 2018 and wrote off the remaining unpaid receivable of $89,609 remaining under the terms of the Agreement.
  
  VidaPlus
  
 On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain. The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing. The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that were incurring annual storage fees. The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR). In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525. Converting the investment from a loan into equity was to take place within 24 months of the date the amount of shares due to the Company pursuant to the second tranche is calculated. According to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
  
 In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of Tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement. Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
  
 In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares. At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus. Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under either Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise. Pursuant to the Agreement, CBAI held a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples. CBAI held that pledge until such time as it converted the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into VidaPlus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. CBAI was required to make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which meant that such conversion would take place around or before February 2014. CBAI also held a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus. On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.  The Company is entitled to an additional ownership stake of approximately 2.24% in connection with the forgoing, bringing its total ownership percentage to approximately 9.24%.
  
 The Company holds approximately 9.24% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the equity investment and loans receivable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the investment as a result of recurring and continued operating losses at VidaPlus. Fair value of the loans receivable is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by assets pledged against the loans. The Company recorded an impairment of 100% of the book value of the equity investment and convertible loan receivable.
