ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 14, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We believe our management team is well-positioned to capitalize on trends and to identify, acquire, and manage a business that can benefit from their operational, strategic, managerial and transaction experience, as well as their differentiated networks.
 
We will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We may also look at earlier stage companies that exhibit the potential to change the industries in which they participate and which will offer the potential of sustained high levels of revenue and earnings growth.
 
On October 31, 2022, we announced that we entered into a business combination agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, with Chijet Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Chijet”), each of the referenced holders of Chijet’s outstanding shares (collectively, the “Sellers”), Chijet Motor Company, Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Chijet (“Pubco”), and Chijet Motor (USA) Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Merger Sub”). Chijet indirectly holds controlling interests in Shandong Baoya New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd., a Chinese company (“Baoya”), which is a producer and manufacturer of electric vehicles, and FAW Jilin Automobile Co., Ltd., a Chinese company (“FAW Jilin”), which manufactures and sells traditional fuel vehicles. The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to herein as the “Business Combination” or the “BCA”. Pursuant to the BCA (a) Pubco will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital shares of Chijet held by the Sellers in exchange for ordinary shares of Pubco, and any shares Chijet holds in Pubco shall be surrendered for no consideration, such that Chijet becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco and the Sellers become shareholders of Pubco (the “Share Exchange”); and immediately thereafter (b) Merger Sub will merge with and into JWAC, with JWAC continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco.
 
The BCA provides that at the effective time of the Business Combination (the “Effective Time”):
 

(i) | all of the outstanding shares of JWAC’s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “JWAC Common Stock”) will be exchanged for the right to receive the ordinary shares of Pubco, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Pubco Ordinary Shares”), comprising 14,705,000 Pubco Ordinary Shares; and all of the outstanding shares of JWAC’s Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), according to our certificate of incorporation, will be converted into JWAC Common Stock and likewise exchanged for the right to receive 3,450,000 Pubco Ordinary Shares (following which exchange all shares of JWAC Common Stock and such shares of Class B Common Stock will be cancelled and cease to exist); and 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | the registered holder of each outstanding right to receive one eighth (1/8) of one share of JWAC Common Stock (collectively, the “JWAC Rights”) will be issued the number of full shares of JWAC Common Stock to which such holder of JWAC Rights is eligible, and which shall be exchanged for the equivalent number of Pubco Ordinary Shares, comprising the amount of 1,803,625 Pubco Ordinary Shares; and 
(iii) | the Sellers will receive the number of Pubco Ordinary Shares in the Share Exchange that shall have an aggregate value equal to One Billion Six Hundred Million Dollars ($1,600,000,000), comprising the amount of 157,519,170 of Pubco Ordinary Shares, subject to certain Sellers having an earnout (the “Earnout”) which would adjust downwards the consideration they receive by up to Six Hundred Seventy Four Million ($674 million) based on certain post-Closing financial performance and stock price metrics of Pubco, and all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the BCA. 

 
Upon the closing of the transactions, the combined company will be named Chijet Motor Company, Inc., and intends to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the new ticker symbol “CJET.”

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to identify and acquire a business with untapped opportunity for building a public company. We believe that our management’s and directors’ experiences, from evaluating assets through investing and company building, will enable us to source and execute a business combination with high-quality targets. Our selection process will leverage the relationships of our board with leading venture capitalists, private equity and hedge fund managers, respected peers, and our network of investment banking executives, attorneys, and accountants. Together with this network of trusted partners, we intend to capitalize the target business and create purposeful strategic initiatives in order to achieve attractive growth and performance after our initial business combination.
 
In particular, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination on private companies that have positive operating cash flow or compelling economics and clear paths to positive operating cash flow, significant assets, and successful management teams that are seeking access to the U.S. public capital markets. Our selection process is expected to leverage our board’s deep and broad network of relationships, industry expertise and deal sourcing capabilities to provide us with a strong pipeline of potential targets. 
 
Acquisition / Investment Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We used this criteria in evaluating initial business combination opportunities. We expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity.
 
The Board considered a number of factors pertaining to the Business Combination as generally supporting its decision to enter into the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, but not limited to, the following material factors:
 

● | Growth Prospects. Analytical data suggests that consumers are receptive to vehicles using alternative fuel and energy sources. The transition to vehicles powered by cleaner forms of energy and regulation thereof in certain geographic regions bodes well for adoption of Chijet’s technology on a significant scale; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad Customer Base. Given the auto industry and electric vehicle industry particulars, Chijet has a broad potential customer base across multiple continents and industries, especially those regions with higher energy prices and taxes on carbon emitting energy sources; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Due Diligence. Business, financial and technical due diligence examinations of Chijet and discussions with Chijet’s management team were conducted, including extensive in-person meetings and calls with Chijet’s management team and its representatives regarding Chijet’s operations and financial prospects, technical analysis. Additional legal and technical review of Chijet’s material contracts, intellectual property and labor matters was conducted. In addition, JWAC engaged AlixPartners, a firm with an expertise in the auto industry to give it access to the report that such firm had prepared for Deep Medicine Acquisition Corp (DMAQ) in its proposed business combination with Chijet. Members of JWAC’s board had several calls with members of AlixPartners to discuss their findings, as well as to ask specific questions relating to its findings in such report. Such due diligence examination of Chijet, in consultation with JWAC’s legal, technical, and financial advisors, indicated to JWAC management that Chijet could assemble the required elements to create a foundation for a potentially very successful vehicle company; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stockholder Liquidity. The obligation in the Business Combination Agreement to have Pubco Ordinary Shares issued as merger consideration listed on the Nasdaq, a major U.S. stock exchange, which the Board believes has the potential to offer JWAC stockholders enhanced liquidity following the Business Combination; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management Team Continuity. Chijet’s senior management team including Liu Shengwang, Wang Xiangyin, Fang Jun, Li Na, and Wang Xinjian, intend to remain with the Combined Company in the capacity of officers following the Business Combination, providing beneficial continuity in advancing Chijet’s strategic and growth goals; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lock-Up. Key Chijet Holders (including its management team) agreed to be subject to lockup provisions of 6 months in respect of their Pubco Ordinary Shares (subject to certain customary exceptions), which would provide important stability to the Combined Company; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Valuation Report. On September 30, 2022, JWAC engaged a third-party for the benefit of its Board in connection with the consideration by the Board of the Business Combination between JWAC and Chijet pursuant to which JWAC would acquire all or substantially all of the assets and business of Chijet (the “Acquired Business”) in consideration of the issuance of common stock of the surviving company. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Alternatives. The Board believes, after a thorough review of other business combination opportunities reasonably available to JWAC that the proposed Business Combination represents the most promising potential business combination for JWAC and the most attractive opportunity based upon the process utilized to evaluate and assess other potential acquisition targets. Given the demand for electric and traditional fuel vehicles and Chijet’s proprietary process, customers and customer pipeline, JWAC’s Board believes Chijet offers its stockholders the most potential value when compared to other target candidates; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Negotiated Transaction. The financial and other terms of the Business Combination Agreement and the fact that such terms and conditions are reasonable and were the product of arm’s length negotiations between JWAC and Chijet. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria as well as other considerations and factors that our management team and advisors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may or may not be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant.
 
JWAC has entered into an extension loan, funding the Trust Account for $1,380,000 in exchange for an unsecured promissory note, which we refer to as the extension loan. The funds for the extension were advanced by Chijet in exchange for a promissory note, with a similar extension loan to be made three months from such date in the same amount by Chijet. The extension loans, along with the other funds in the Trust Account will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of public shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of public shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of our initial Business Combination. The extension loans bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the consummation of our Business Combination. If the Company does not complete the Business Combination by March 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be extended by means of a further contribution to the Trust Account in accordance with the JWAC Certificate of Incorporation or amendment to such certificate), the loans will not be repaid.
 
In order to meet JWAC’s working capital needs, the Sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, and which we refer to as working capital loans. Each such loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at a holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. If JWAC does not complete a business combination, JWAC may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay these loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay these loans. 
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct thorough due diligence that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private shares and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. On October 26, 2022, we announced that we entered into the Business Combination Agreement. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.

Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of private shares, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination which has not yet been identified. Accordingly, investors are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business.
 
We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating Chijet, our management considered a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 
● | brand recognition and potential; 
● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | barriers to entry; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 


4
-


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | impact of regulation on the business; 
● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating, we conducted an extensive due diligence review which encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which was made available to us. This due diligence review was conducted by our management.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test. The JWAC Board determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed Business Combination.

We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until March 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be extended by means of a further contribution to the Trust Account in accordance with the JWAC Certificate of Incorporation or amendment to such certificate), subject to applicable law in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to redeem any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, sponsor, or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to redeem their shares, our officers, directors, sponsor, or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of redemptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Redemption Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Our sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.

-


Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact.
 
Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If JWAC has not completed the Business Combination with Pubco by March 9, 2023 (unless otherwise extended in accordance with our certificate of incorporation) and has not completed another business combination by such date, JWAC will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem its public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest will be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of JWAC’s remaining stockholders and its board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, dated December 6, 2021, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, placement shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, placement shares and public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares and placement shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus), although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
 
JWAC expects that all costs and expenses associated with implementing its plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although it cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing JWAC’s plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes, JWAC may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of JWAC’s creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of JWAC’s public stockholders. JWAC cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While JWAC intend to pay such amounts, if any, JWAC cannot assure you that JWAC will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share (which was the offering price per unit in our initial public offering)” and other risk factors contained herein.
 
JWAC will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than JWAC’s independent auditors), prospective target businesses and other entities with which JWAC does business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. The Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under JWAC’s indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
 
If JWAC files a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and may be included in JWAC’s insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of JWAC’s stockholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the Trust Account, JWAC cannot assure you JWAC will be able to return $10.00 per share to JWAC’s public stockholders. Additionally, if JWAC files a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable performance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by JWAC’s stockholders. Furthermore, the JWAC Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to JWAC’s creditors or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. JWAC cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
JWAC’s public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) JWAC’s completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of JWAC Common Stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the JWAC Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of JWAC’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with JWAC’s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if JWAC does not complete JWAC’s initial business combination by that applicable date (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of the public shares if JWAC has not completed an initial business combination by the March 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be extended by means of a further contribution to the Trust Account in accordance with the JWAC Certificate of Incorporation or amendment to such certificate), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Because the Company will request stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to (i) waive its redemption rights with respect to their Private Placement Shares in connection with the completion of the Business Combination, (ii) waive its redemption rights with respect to their Private Placement Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity and (iii) waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Private Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period. In addition, the Sponsor has agreed to vote any share it held in favor of the Business Combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by March 9, 2023 (unless otherwise extended in accordance with our certificate of incorporation) and has not completed another business combination by such date then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company; 
● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our initial public offering on an initial business combination.

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private shares, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to redeem or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and 
● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 1061 E. Indiantown Road, Suite 110, Jupiter, Florida 33477, and its telephone number is (561) 244-7100. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $100 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to JWAC matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process JWAC is in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and will have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
To the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property.
