Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a life sciences company pioneering a novel technology for bioengineering fully transplantable organs to help save and improve patients’ lives. Founded in 2009, we are one of a small group of companies at the forefront of developing alternatives to human-donor organ transplants, and within this small group of companies there are important differences between the technologies being developed. Our proprietary technology is a scalable platform that uses a two-step method of decellularization and recellularization designed to remove the porcine cells from the organs obtained from pigs and replace them with unmodified human cells. Our initial development focus is on bioengineering livers and kidneys, and our technology platform is also applicable to bioengineering other organs including, hearts, lungs and pancreases. We have collaborations with the Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai and the Texas Heart Institute, and have received strategic investments from Baxter, CareDx and DaVita.
We believe we are uniquely positioned and that our technology has multiple potential benefits:

● | Designed to reduce the risk of organ rejection. We recellularize the decellularized porcine organs with unmodified human cells. We believe the use of unmodified human cells in our bioengineered organs could result in a favorable organ rejection profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preserves natural organ structures and functions. We individually perfuse the organs throughout the decellularization and recellularization steps to preserve the mechanical structures and vascular networks of the porcine organs as we transform them into bioengineered organs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proven safety profile and efficient regulatory pathways. Our decellularization process is designed to remove the porcine cells from the organs obtained from pigs, which is the same process our commercialized products utilize, and they are not classified or regulated as xenotransplants. Therefore, because our bioengineered organs are decellularized with the same process as our commercialized products and recellularized with unmodified human cells, we believe they should not be regulated as xenotransplants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilizes existing supply chains for organ procurement. We procure our porcine organs from readily available farm sources and do not rely on breeding genetically modified animals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-house manufacturing capabilities. Our in-house manufacturing facility allows us to manufacture our bioengineered organs while controlling our development timelines and production quality.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collaborations with leading transplant institutions and strategic partners. Our relationships with Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Texas Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Baxter, DaVita and CareDx provide us with access to highly respected third-party partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop bioengineered organs and be the first to market with alternatives to human-donor organ transplants. The key elements of our strategy include: 

● | Advance our initial product candidate, MiroliverELAP, into phase 1 clinical trials shortly after our IND clearance is received from the FDA
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance the pre-clinical development of our fully implantable bioengineered organ programs, Miroliver and Mirokidney, and further establish our regulatory pathway with the FDA
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage our in-house manufacturing capabilities to control our development timelines and production quality
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broadly communicate our unique positioning and technology platform to increase awareness of our Company
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Foster and potentially grow our relationships with leading transplant institutions and strategic partners
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Bioengineered Organ Technology Platform
Our technology platform encompasses two proprietary steps referred to as decellularization and recellularization. Decellularization is a process that is designed to remove the porcine cells from the organs obtained from pigs to create a purified acellular extracellular matrix (“ECM”). Recellularization is a process that re-seeds the ECM with unmodified human cells inside individual bioreactors. Throughout this two-step process, the organ is perfused with a gentle solution to purify and re-seed the ECM while preserving the mechanical structures and vascular networks. Our technology platform was originally developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota (the “University”) and we have an exclusive license agreement with them. 
Decellularization
Decellularization is a process that removes the porcine cells from the organs obtained from pigs to create a purified acellular ECM. Organs are notoriously complex to decellularize and reproduce synthetically because they are dense with vasculature. Our novel decellularization process solves for the challenging anatomy of organs by cannulating the native vasculature and perfusing the organ with a gentle cleaning solution which maximizes the surface areas exposed to the detergent. Our proprietary perfusion process purifies the organs while preserving the mechanical structures and vascular networks. This process allows for a very effective and efficient decellularization process that can be completed in less than 24 hours. Following decellularization, the organ goes through a series of washes to remove the detergent and disinfect the ECM over a period of two to three days. The result is a completely purified and preserved native scaffold that can be stored for up to 12 months, containing the appropriate microenvironment required for the introduction of organ- specific unmodified human cells.
Decellularization of Porcine Liver

These images have been provided to demonstrate the decellularization process, and are not protypes for our BEL product candidate, and do not represent results from a clinical trial.

Recellularization
Recellularization is a process that incorporates perfusion to re-seed the ECM with unmodified human cells inside individual bioreactors. We source the human cells from human kidneys and livers not placed for transplant. We have agreements with several Organ Procurement Organizations (“OPOs”) to secure our supplies of human kidneys and livers. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to isolate the required cells from even highly compromised organs and these isolated cells are either directly seeded, or cultured and expanded in proprietary media, which we believe will enable us to recellularize multiple ECMs from one human organ. The recellularized organ matures in a bioreactor where it is continuously perfused with nutrient-rich media and oxygenated under normal physiological conditions. Our entire recellularization process can be completed in two to four weeks depending on the organ type. Our finished bioengineered organs will be able to be transplanted utilizing the same techniques and equipment as current organ transplantation procedures, which we believe could prove favorable in the adoption of our products. 
A landmark publication by Nature Medicine described perfusion decellularization as a technique to generate acellular whole organ matrices. Since then, several notable publications such as Journal of Hepatology, Nature Communications Biology, Nature Biomedical Engineering, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology and Transplant Proceedings have reported the use of the Company’s perfusion decellularization technology as the basis of their animal studies in multiple whole organs including livers, kidneys, hearts, lungs and pancreases. The animal organ matrices studied in these articles were subsequently re-seeded with various cell types, including human cells, using the Company’s perfusion recellularization technology. An important conclusion of these studies is that they each resulted in the creation of functional cellular phenotypes and increased cellular viability on the ECMs which is critical to bioengineering an organ. These third-party studies provide a large body of data supporting the merits of our technology.
Our Bioengineered Organ Pipeline
All of our bioengineered organ transplant programs utilize our proprietary technology platform. Our product pipeline is being thoughtfully developed by leveraging data and learnings from prior programs to inform our development decisions for future programs. The first programs we developed are Miromesh and Miroderm, which are commercialized for hernia repair and wound care applications, respectively. Both products received 510(k) clearances from the FDA and are not classified or regulated as xenotransplants. Both products are derived from porcine livers and utilize our proprietary perfusion decellularization process to create an ECM implant. These products have been on the market for over six years and have been implanted in thousands of patients since then. Over that time, we have completed three post-market clinical studies and we believe this provides valuable safety data to leverage in the development of our current pipeline. In June 2019, we decided to focus all of our resources on bioengineering human organ transplants, so we licensed Miromesh and Miroderm to a business named Reprise Biomedical, Inc (“Reprise”). In March 2021, we divested the entirety of our equity ownership in Reprise and continue to collect royalties relating to the licensing of these products. 
As Miromesh and Miroderm utilize our decellularization process and are not regulated as xenotransplants, and our recellularization process incorporates unmodified human cells, we believe our bioengineered organs should not be regulated as xenotransplants. Our current expectation for our bioengineered organs is that they will be regulated as biologics or potentially combination products. We believe that either classification will lead to a more efficient regulatory pathway than if they were to be classified as xenotransplants. 
The FDA defines xenotransplantation as any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues or organs. The guidance also specifically states that xenotransplantation does not include transplantation, implantation or other use of acellular animal tissues. During our decellularization process, we remove all animal cells and the acellular scaffold is recellularized with unmodified human cells, which we believe will lead regulators to determine that our bioengineered organs are not xenotransplants. However, neither the FDA or any other regulator has informed us what classification our product candidates will be regulated as. Further, as part of our regulatory pathway we will need to seek an exemption from the FDA for the current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTP”) prohibition against pooling cells from two or more donors during manufacturing.

Our Bioengineered Organ Pipeline
Bioengineered External Liver Assist Product
MiroliverELAP is our External Liver Assist Product (“ELAP”) and is designed to provide liver dialysis for acute liver failure patients. The ELAP System consists of an external perfusion system and our bioengineered liver (“BEL”) that will reside outside of the human body to provide temporary liver support to patients with acute liver failure. We believe this will be the first-ever clinical trial designed to assess the ability of a BEL to deliver critical liver function in humans. 
We published two important studies providing additional proof of concept supporting our BELs. One of the studies was published in a 2019 publication of Nature Biomedical Engineering and demonstrated the ability to revascularize a decellularized liver scaffold with human vascular cells and sustain perfusion in a large animal recovery model. In 2021, the second study was published in Nature Communications Biology and builds on the previous study by implanting a liver scaffold seeded with human endothelial cells and porcine hepatocytes into a pig donor recipient and showed hepatic function and sustained blood perfusion. The success of these preclinical studies supports our intentions to commence human trials for our ELAP product candidate.
Demonstrated Ex Vivo Liver Function
Figure: BELs seeded and cultured with endothelial cells and primary hepatocytes demonstrate liver specific function through the production of Albumin and Urea, and the clearance of ammonia in a challenge assay during bench testing.
Another significant milestone was our ability to demonstrate liver functionality following the addition of liver hepatocytes. During bench testing, we demonstrated the ability of the recellularized grafts to perform key liver functions, including albumin production, urea synthesis and an important liver function, ammonia clearance. These studies have been completed with porcine and human hepatocytes. Our optimization efforts have led to an increase in hepatocytes 

4




seeded into the livers to over 10 billion, which we can consistently manufacture and consider to be a key clinical threshold.
We are pioneering a new class of therapy with our bioengineered organs, and similar to innovators of other new classes of therapies we are working closely with the FDA to establish our regulatory pathway. In the first quarter of 2022 we received a response from the FDA to our pre-IND submission and we anticipate filing an IND application in the second half of 2022, followed by the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial shortly after our IND clearance is received from the FDA.
Bioengineered Liver Program
Miroliver is our fully implantable bioengineered liver intended to treat patients with acute and chronic liver failure that we have been developing since 2011 in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic. This program is an orthotopic liver transplantation (“OLT”) where the native liver is completely removed and replaced with our Miroliver. The Miroliver is bioengineered by recellularizing a decellularized porcine liver with human endothelial cells (vascular), hepatocytes and accessory cells (liver cells), and cholangiocytes (bile duct cells), which can be anastomosed directly into the host’s circulatory system. Miroliver will be considered for replacement of a diseased or malfunctioning native liver in patients who have reached the limits of other medical therapies and lack access to a transplantable liver due to, acute liver failure, complications of cirrhosis, liver-based metabolic disease, systemic complications of chronic liver disease, and chronic liver disease. 
Surgical Implantation of a Revascularized Liver Graft in a Large Animal
Figure: The surgical implantation and perfusion of our revascularized BEL into a pig model demonstrating the ability to surgically implant the graft and achieve active perfusion by the recipient. This study was performed at the Mayo Clinic. These images have been provided to demonstrate the process of surgically implanting a BEL and are not prototypes of the BEL that we expect to use for human clinical trials.
In a 2019 study published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, we completed a large animal study that demonstrated the ability to revascularize a decellularized liver scaffold with human vascular cells and sustain perfusion in a large animal recovery model. This study highlighted three key milestones: (1) demonstrated sustained patency which has been a significant vascular challenge inhibiting bioengineering of organs; (2) demonstrated the ability to non-destructively monitor the revascularization process, an important step in manufacturing and quality control, and this was achieved through monitoring metabolic function during the bioreactor phase by monitoring the glucose consumption rate (“GCR”); and (3) demonstrated the ability of the introduced endothelial cells to upregulate the expression of liver specific endothelial cell markers and detection of fenestrations, a hallmark attribute of liver sinusoidal endothelium, demonstrating the potential ability of the decellularized matrix to provide the appropriate cellular signals or cues.

In a 2021 study published in Nature Communications Biology, we completed the first ever heterotopic implant of our BEL transplant into a large animal. The transplant was part of a preclinical study in collaboration with researchers at Mayo Clinic, designed to assess the initial transplantation and functionality of a bioengineered liver in an acute liver failure model. It utilized decellularized porcine liver scaffolds recellularized with human vascular cells and porcine hepatocytes, which were implanted into pigs suffering acute liver failure. The study included five pigs, of which three were implanted with a liver scaffold seeded with human vascular cells and porcine hepatocytes. All pigs were monitored for up to 48 hours, during which time the transplanted organ showed critical performance metrics, including the ability to sustain blood flow and key liver function both before and after transplantation. These post-operative results address the critical vascular challenge in tissue engineering that has previously inhibited advancement in this field. The results showed that the pigs that received the BELs maintained detectable hepatic health in the graft, sustained blood perfusion, and demonstrated early liver function post transplantation.
Successful Bile Duct Seeding and Staining
Figure: Localization and cell specific expression of key cholangiocyte markers following their seeding into BEL grafts. Cells were detected with the following markers: EpCam, a general epithelial marker, Cytokeratin 19 (CK19)- a general cholangiocyte marker, Cytokeratin 7 (CK7)-a cholangiocyte marker localized to larger bile ducts, Alpha-tubulin which stains the presences of a key cholangiocyte feature and GGT- a transmembrane glycoprotein localized to the luminal surface. All sections were counterstained with DAPI a nuclear stain.
Our fully transplantable Miroliver includes the recellularization of the biliary system which is achieved through the seeding of bile duct cells (cholangiocytes) directly into the bile duct. The BEL utilized in our ELAP does not require cholangiocytes. We have demonstrated the ability to isolate, culture, expand and seed cholangiocytes. We achieved a key milestone by demonstrating site specific localization and the appropriate phenotypic expression within our BEL grafts. Seeded cholangiocytes were identified within the biliary tree with high levels of expression of the general cholangiocyte marker, Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), along with the appropriate cuboidal morphology and polarization. Cytokeratin 7 (CK7), which is localized to larger bile ducts was present in the larger ducts but absent in smaller ones. Impressively, alpha-tubulin, which stains the presences of a key cholangiocyte feature, the central cilia, was localized in the lumen. Lastly, Gamma-glutamyltransferase (“GGT”) was localized to the luminal surface of the bile ducts. Collectively, the positive staining and site- specific localization of key markers confirm our ability to recellularize the biliary tree.
We are pioneering a new class of therapy with our bioengineered organs, and similar to innovators of other new classes of therapies we are working closely with the FDA to establish our regulatory pathway. We have had consultations with the FDA and we anticipate submitting our pre-IND request in 2023, followed by the filing of an IND application and the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial shortly after our IND clearance is received from the FDA.
Bioengineered Kidney Program
Mirokidney is our fully implantable bioengineered kidney (“BEK”) intended to treat patients with end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”) that was awarded the Kidney X prize from Department of Health and Human Services and the American Society of Nephrology in 2019. Our Mirokidney is bioengineered through the recellularization of a decellularized porcine kidney with human endothelial cells (vascular) and human renal specific cells, including key cells of the glomerulus (mesangial cells and podocytes) and nephron (proximal and distal tubule cells, thin and thick limb Loop of Henle cells, and collecting duct cells). The BEK can be connected directly into the host’s circulatory system 

6




using a heterotopic kidney transplant (“HKT”) procedure where the native kidneys are left in place and a single kidney is grafted into the vasculature. HKT procedures are the standard of care for kidney transplants and are generally considered to pose less safety risks to patients than orthotopic implants. The BEK will be considered for replacement of a diseased or malfunctioning native kidney in patients who have reached the limits of other medical therapies and lack access to a human-donor transplantable kidney due to chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) or ESRD. CKD and ESRD are often the result of diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, cystic kidney disease or other common conditions. We anticipate the BEK will be studied for supplementation of diseased or malfunctioning native kidneys in adults and for its ability to support life sustaining hemi-filtration.
Demonstrated Kidney Vascular Patency in Preclinical Models
Figure: OLT of human endothelialized BEK grafts in a pig model. Adult pigs underwent unilateral nephrectomy followed by OLT of endothelialized kidney grafts. An anastomosed BEK graft is shown before and after reperfusion. Compilation of follow-up angiographies performed on a kidney graft through Day 14 demonstrate continuous perfusion of the implant revascularized BEK. These images have been provided to demonstrate the process of transplanting BEK grafts, and the corresponding results in follow-up angiograms, and are not prototypes of our BEK.
In a study performed in conjunction with transplant surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital we demonstrated key functional aspects for our BEKs including long-term patency of a revascularized kidney after implantation in a large animal model. The first key finding of this study is that we demonstrated our ability to revascularize a decellularized porcine kidney and utilize the metabolic marker of GCR as a predictor of revascularization, which will serve as an important manufacturing control. The GCR is directly correlated to the ability of the BEK to remain patent. Second, we demonstrated that revascularized BEKs, based on predictive GCR rates, were able to be heterotopically transplanted into our large animal model with direct renal artery and vein anastomosis, highlighting the similarities to normal kidney transplantation. Our transplanted revascularized kidneys maintained whole kidney perfusion over 14 days as measured by angiograms and demonstrated the ability to withstand physiological pressures and flow. Maintaining perfusion in our transplanted revascularized kidneys in a normal transplant model was a key milestone and solves an issue which has inhibited the advancement of bioengineering organs and complex tissues. In separate bench testing studies, we have further demonstrated early kidney function, including creatinine clearance.
Following the successful revascularization of the kidney, we focused on the recellularization of the glomerular and nephron structures within the kidney. We achieved this milestone by demonstrating our ability to procure, isolate, and seed revascularized BEKs with both human and porcine kidney cells, human renal specific cells for the glomerulus (Mesangial Cells and Podocytes) and nephron (proximal and distal tubule cells, thin and thick limb Loop of Henle cells, and collecting duct cells). Isolated tubule epithelial cells were seeded into decellularized localized to nephron tubules and collecting ducts and demonstrated a >50% matrix coverage after 14 days. This heterogenous mixture of kidney

parenchymal cells proliferated, expressed E-cadherin with a tubular epithelial morphology and more importantly, acquired a ciliated brush border, a key hallmark of mature and functioning proximal tubules.
Demonstrated Nephron Recellularization
Figure: Tubule epithelial cells were seeded localized to nephron tubules and collecting ducts as detected by positive E-cadherin staining. Total coverage increased from ~10% to ~50% after 14 days of continuous perfusion within the BEK with active proliferation as characterized by positive Ki67+ staining. Electron microscopy of the tubules demonstrated the presence of ciliated brush border, a key hallmark of mature and functioning proximal tubules cilia formation (arrows).
Isolated human kidney cells seeded into the decellularized matrix with expression of epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (“EpCAM”) indicative of a distal tubule or collecting duct phenotype and expression of the proximal tubule markers aquaporin-1 (“AQP1”) and type I gamma-glutamyltransferase (“GGT1”) with positive Ki67 co-expression of the latter indicating proliferation of primary proximal tubule cells in recellularized BEK. Additional studies have demonstrated the ability to localize endothelial and epithelial cells to the glomerulus with site specific orientation.
We are pioneering a new class of therapy with our bioengineered organs, and similar to innovators of other new classes of therapies we are working closely with the FDA to establish our regulatory pathway. We anticipate submitting our pre-IND request in 2023, followed by the filing of an IND application and the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial shortly after our IND clearance is received from the FDA.
Potential Future Programs
Currently, we are directing nearly all of our resources towards the development of our MiroliverELAP, Miroliver and Mirokidney programs. In the future, we may decide to develop additional programs on our own or in collaboration with other organizations or institutions. For example, our bioengineered human organ technology platform has broad applicability to other organs such as hearts, lungs and pancreases (for the treatment of diabetes).

Beyond the applicability of our technology platform in other organs, we may explore the merits of using stem cells to recellularize our decellularized organs. This could include the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPSCs”) that would either be patient derived (autologous) or derived from a universal donor (allogeneic). Among other benefits, we believe the use of iPSCs could potentially eliminate the need for immunosuppression, provide benefits such as making the recellularized organ more patient-specific in the case of an autologous approach, as well making the manufacturing process more efficient in the case of an autologous approach.
In addition, we believe our technology and intellectual property has applicability to bioengineered partial organs, including heart valves, glands, tissues and bones.

Market
Organ transplantation is one of the largest unmet medical needs facing the world today. According to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplant (“GODT”), in 2019 there were 157,155 organ transplant procedures performed globally and 40,540 performed in the U.S. within our addressable markets. Organ transplant procedures declined slightly in 2020 and 2021 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical procedures suggesting future years may see an uptick in procedural growth. Kidney and liver transplants make up over 80% of the transplant procedures performed and they are the initial target markets for our bioengineered organ product candidates. Below is a summary of the organ transplants performed in 2019 and the U.S. organ transplant waitlist as of March 24, 2022.

For each organ type, the organ transplant numbers only represent patients who were fortunate enough to receive a transplant and do not represent the entirety of potential demand. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in early 2022 the organ transplant waitlist in the U.S. was 116,388 and kidneys and livers made up nearly 95% of that total. Additional demand for organ transplants may come from severely ill patients who currently do not qualify for an organ transplant waitlist because their disease stage isn’t severe enough to be allocated a transplantable organ. If additional supply of transplantable organs were available, such as our bioengineered organ product candidates, we believe the demand for organ transplants could increase significantly.
Kidney
​
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), it is estimated that 37 million people in the U.S. have kidney disease and most of these cases are undiagnosed. Chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) and end stage renal disease (“ESRD”) can be treated, but damage to the kidney cannot be repaired or reversed. Because CKD and ESRD are irreversible, once a patient begins dialysis they will remain on dialysis until they receive a transplant or they die. United States Renal Data System (“USRDS”) estimates over 550,000 patients in the U.S. receive dialysis, and the median wait time for a kidney transplant is 49.2 months. Five-year survival rates for patients receiving dialysis are less than 50%, compared to over 80% for kidney transplant recipients. 
The costs associated with dialysis are staggering: Medicare-related spending for CKD and ESRD patients exceeded $119 billion in 2018 and the American Journal of Transplantation estimates each kidney transplant could save the health care system over $1.5 million. According to a 2021 white paper from Optum, Inc., monthly dialysis costs as much as $23,000 per patient. The report highlights that compared to dialysis, kidney transplantation leads to higher patient survival, improved quality of life and lower costs to the healthcare system. It also emphasizes that the benefits of preemptive transplants are widely recognized; defined as transplants that occur before patients progress to ESRD. For patients living with CKD, receiving a kidney transplant before they need to start dialysis allows them to stay healthier and live longer than if they were to receive a transplant after their kidneys fail. 
If approved, we believe our Mirokidney product candidate could provide a viable treatment for patients suffering from ESRD and CKD while also providing significant cost savings to the health care system.

Liver
Unlike ESRD patients who can survive for years on kidney dialysis as they await a kidney transplant, there is currently not a similarly effective solution for end stage liver disease (“ESLD”) patients. There have been technologies developed referred to as liver dialysis but they have not proved successful because they primarily filter the blood but do not replicate the hundreds of other functions the liver performs. The liver performs many complex functions in the body including protein production, metabolization, production of bile to digest fat and absorb vitamins, storage of vitamins, regulation of blood clotting, removal of bacteria from the blood to fight infection, and removal of toxic byproducts of medications and alcohol.
Chronic Liver Failure
According to the Cleveland Clinic, it is estimated that 30 million people in the U.S. have some type of liver disease and 5.5 million Americans have chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. There are many different causes of liver disease including viral infections, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, inherited genetic diseases, autoimmune disorders and cancer. Chronic liver disease can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes if it has not progressed to ESLD. Once it progresses to ESLD a liver transplant is typically the best treatment option. 
If our Miroliver product candidate gains approval we believe it could provide a viable treatment for patients suffering from ESLD who ultimately require a transplant.
Acute Liver Failure
Approximately 80,000 patients are hospitalized in the U.S. each year with acute forms of liver failure, acute on chronic liver failure and severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, collectively “ALF”. ALF refers to a rapid loss of liver function - days or weeks – often in a person who has no history of preexisting liver disease. Common causes include hepatitis viruses, drugs such as acetaminophen and excessive alcohol use. ALF can cause serious complications including excessive bleeding and pressure on the brain, making it a medical emergency that requires hospitalization. Patients suffering from ALF often receive liver dialysis treatments which are intended to provide support until the patient’s liver realizes spontaneous recovery or as a bridge to liver transplant. Liver dialysis has historically been associated with the challenges described in the previous paragraph, and the outcomes for ALF patients are estimated to be 45% spontaneous recovery, 25% liver transplantation and 30% death without transplant.
If approved, we believe our MiroliverELAP product candidate could better replicate the functions of a human liver than currently available liver dialysis treatment options which could lead to a significantly higher percentage of spontaneous recoveries. Additionally, if our Miroliver product candidate gains approval we believe it could provide a viable treatment for patients suffering from ALF who ultimately require a transplant.
Competition
The life sciences industry is characterized by the rapid development of technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our technologies, approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages in our target markets. We are striving to be first to market with our product candidates and we expect substantial competition over time. We also believe the organ transplant market is unique because it is one of the largest unmet medical needs facing the world today and therefore many companies may enjoy commercial success with their products, regardless of technology modality, upon gaining regulatory approval. We compete in two primary market segments: External Liver Assist and Whole Organ Transplant. 
External Liver Assist Technologies
With respect to MiroliverELAP, we are not aware of any commercialized or in-development external liver assist systems utilizing bioengineered organs. There are companies who have developed liver dialysis products and others may be in development, however we believe our MiroliverELAP bioengineered organ technology could better replicate the functions of a human liver than currently available liver dialysis treatment options. 

10




Whole Organ Transplant Technologies
We segment the whole organ transplant marketplace into three primary technologies: bioengineering, xenotransplantation and 3D printing. We categorize our MiroliverELAP, Miroliver and Mirokidney product candidates as bioengineering.

● | Bioengineering: We believe we are the only company with the intellectual property and know-how pertaining to the development of bioengineered organs utilizing perfusion decellularization and recellularization. Our bioengineered organs encompass the use of decellularization which creates an ECM void of animal cells, recellularization which re-seeds the ECM with unmodified human cells, and perfusion which maintains the structure and vasculature of the organ throughout both steps. We believe these components create significant favorable differentiation versus alternative technologies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Xenotransplantation: We are aware of xenotransplantation technologies being developed by Revivicor, Inc., a subsidiary of United Therapeutics Corporation, eGenesis, Inc., Recombinetics, Inc. and potentially other companies. Xenotransplanation has been active for decades and recent advances of CRISPR technology have reinvigorated the field. CRISPR technology edits parts of the genome by removing, adding or altering sections of the DNA sequence. Xenotransplantation utilizing CRISPR is being investigated in the genetic engineering of pigs in an attempt to remove immunogenic proteins in hopes of enabling direct transplant of porcine organs into humans.

Some of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license, or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
Collaborations and Partnerships
Mayo Clinic
On January 1, 2011, we entered into a license agreement with the Mayo Clinic, and have thereafter entered into subsequent amendments (as amended, the “Mayo Agreement”), pursuant to which we and the Mayo Clinic have agreed to collaborate to test and evaluate the viability of the transplantation of a recellularized liver. Specifically, the collaboration aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a transplanted recellularized liver in a recipient large animal, along with determining the most effective conditions and techniques for re-seeding the liver. We are responsible for delivering the recellularized liver to the Mayo Clinic, whose surgeons are responsible for the transplantation and evaluation of the recellularized liver. The Mayo Clinic will own all rights to any inventions or discoveries solely developed pursuant to the Mayo Agreement, however, we have the exclusive right to license any such inventions or discoveries. To date, we have completed hepatocyte isolations, created surgical transplant models, generated transplant data from the BEL published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, and submitted the data pertaining to initial liver function, which is for publication. 
Mount Sinai
On October 19, 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Mount Sinai Hospital, whereby we have developed a large animal kidney transplantation model to demonstrate continuous blood flow through a perfusion decellularized and recellularized transplanted kidney. Utilizing this model, we have achieved transplantation of numerous revascularized kidneys by the surgeons at Mount Sinai. Neither party is subject to any royalty or milestone obligations. The agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty days written notice to the other party, and is 

11




set to expire in March of 2023. Any inventions, patentable or not, conceived during the course of the collaboration shall be owned solely by either Mount Sinai or us, to the extent reduced to practice by such party’s employees. However, (i) we shall be granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use such inventions conceived solely by Mount Sinai employees for our non-commercial, internal research activities; provided that we shall not be granted such license over surgical techniques developed solely by Mount Sinai employees and (ii) Mount Sinai shall be granted an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free license to use such inventions conceived solely by our employees for its internal research and teaching purposes. We and Mount Sinai shall jointly own any inventions conceived by employees of both parties.
Texas Heart Institute
On October 1, 2013, we entered into a sub-license agreement with THI, and have thereafter entered into subsequent amendments thereto (as amended, the “THI License Agreement”), pursuant to which we have granted THI an exclusive sub-license to our intellectual property related to the transplantation of the heart organ in human beings, whereby perfusion decellularization and/or perfusion recellularization has been utilized in any portion of the creation or manufacture of such whole heart organ. Under this agreement, THI is required to achieve certain milestones by certain dates, and the failure to do as much provides us with the right to terminate the THI License Agreement. These milestones require THI to, among other things: (i) develop the cardiac decellularization and recellularization process, resulting in a functional recellularized heart, (ii) complete preclinical studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a whole heart transplantation in large animals using perfusion technology and (iii) to file an IND submission for a phase 1 trial and complete a FHI clinical trial. Once the first- in-human clinical trial is completed, all licensing rights will revert from THI back to us and THI will receive a 5.0% royalty on all of our commercial sales of products related to the transplantation of the heart organ in human beings using the perfusion decellularization and recellularization process. Further, to the extent we fail to meet any of our milestones after the licensing rights have reverted from THI back to us, and are provided written notice by THI of such failure, and fail to cure such failure in 60 days, the sub-license will revert back to THI, subject to a 10.0% royalty due to us on all of THI’s commercial sales of products related to the transplantation of the heart organ in human beings using the perfusion decellularization and recellularization process. The THI License Agreement may be terminated upon a breach of the agreement or our or THI’s bankruptcy, and shall have no further effect on a patent-by-patent basis, once the applicable patent term has expired. Additionally, if THI fails to meet any milestone, we may terminate their sub-license rights, however, to the extent we are granted FDA approval within three years of such termination, THI will retain their 5.0% royalty right. If we do not obtain such approval within three years, all licenses, sublicenses and royalty obligations under the agreement shall immediately terminate. To date, progress has been achieved on the initial recellularization of the bioengineered heart. 
University of Minnesota
On February 4, 2010, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the University of Minnesota (“the University”), and have thereafter entered into subsequent amendments thereto (as amended, the “EPLA”). The EPLA grants us an exclusive license over the decellularization and recellularization of organs and tissues, among other processes and products, and such patents provide us with exclusivity in numerous jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the U.S., throughout Europe, China, Australia and Japan. We entered into an amendment to the EPLA on September 15, 2016, which transferred the ownership, right, title and interest in all of the licensed patents under the EPLA to the Company. Under the EPLA, the Company is required to make annual minimum royalty payments to the University totaling the greater of $500,000 and the sum of 6.5% of net sales of any licensed products. Further, to the extent we license any products developed under the EPLA to an assignee, we shall provide payment in the amount of 25% of such royalties received by such assignee to the University. We also pay the University an annual maintenance fee of $5,000. There are no milestone payments due under the EPLA. As of December 31, 2021, we have paid the University $1,125,081 under the EPLA. The EPLA and the royalties due thereunder will continue in full force and effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the licensed patents are no longer valid. Further, the EPLA does not have any termination provisions. We entered into an amendment to the EPLA on February 21, 2021, which allows us to defer the payment of any difference between the $500,000 minimum annual payment and what was actually provided to the University for each of calendar years 2020 and 2021 and such difference shall be added to the minimum sum required for calendar years 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Reprise Biomedical, Inc.
Concurrently with the spin-out of Reprise Biomedical, Inc. (“Reprise”) on June 30, 2019, we entered into a patent and know-how license agreement with Reprise, and have thereafter entered into subsequent amendments thereto (as amended, the “Reprise License Agreement”), which entitles us to an annual payment from Reprise equal to the greater of $500,000 and 6.5% of all sales of products utilizing our decellularization technology, including, but not limited to, Miromesh and Miroderm, and which grants them an exclusive license over any acellular products derived from our perfusion decellularization technology, which does not include: (i) decellularized whole organs, (ii) all non-clinical applications or (iii) use in 3D printing applications. There are no milestone or other payments due under the Reprise License Agreement. Reprise provided us with total royalty payments of $33,066 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $46,530 during the year ended December 31, 2020 under the Reprise License Agreement. We also recorded a long-term receivable of $920,404 and $453,470 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, related to the minimum royalty due from Reprise, but due to the uncertainty regarding collectability, we fully reserved against the receivable. The Reprise License Agreement and the royalties due thereunder will continue in full force and effect on a product- by-product and country-by-country basis until the licensed patents are no longer valid or unless we terminate the agreement. We may terminate the Reprise License Agreement, (i) in the event of a breach, (ii) if Reprise fails to make any payment due under the agreement and does not cure such non- payment within the applicable time period and (iii) in the event of Reprise’s bankruptcy. Further, we entered into an amendment to the Reprise License Agreement on February 21, 2021, which allows Reprise to defer the payment of any difference between the $500,000 minimum annual payment and what was actually provided to us for each of calendar years 2020 and 2021 and such difference shall be added to the minimum sum required for calendar years 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We intend to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including any relevant exclusivity through supplementary protection certificates.
Patents
We own numerous patents and/or patent applications which relate to our material products, including patents and/or patent applications with respect to Miroliver, Mirokidney, Mirolung, Miroheart, Miropancreas, perfusion decellularization, perfusion recellularization, revascularization, acellular matrix and the use of stem cells. Although in the aggregate our intellectual property is of material importance to our business, we do not believe that any single patent is of material importance to our product portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, we wholly own or exclusively license 8 issued U.S. patents and 14 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our products and process. The U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2026 and 2036. We also wholly own or exclusively license 115 foreign patents and 24 pending foreign patent applications relating to our products and process. The foreign patents are expected to expire between 2026 and 2036. 
The pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2026 and 2040, without accounting for potential patent term extensions and adjustments.
We expect to seek 5-year patent term extension (“PTE”) under the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act (the “ACT”). The ACT allows the extension of the term of a patent claiming a product that requires regulatory approval prior to being sold. The determination as to whether PTE should be granted is made by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”), in consultation with the regulatory agency responsible for approval of the product. See “Government Regulation — U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity” for more details related to the limitations and guidelines surrounding PTEs under the ACT.

Additional protection may be sought through FDA exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Exclusivity of 7 years or under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 of 12 years. 
Employees
As of February 28, 2022, we had 61 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
Properties
We lease our corporate headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota which houses all of our employees as well as our research and development and in-house manufacturing capabilities. Our headquarters totals approximately 42,000 square feet, including 11,000 square feet dedicated to in-house manufacturing. We believe our in-house manufacturing facility provides us with adequate capacity to manufacture our bioengineered organs while controlling our development timelines and production quality through clinical trials.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We maintain 11,000 square feet of in-house manufacturing capabilities within our corporate headquarters where we produce all of our bioengineered organs. This facility will be maintained to the same standards as our previous cGMP manufacturing facility that received ISO 13485 certification for manufacturing of sterile decellularized porcine matrix. We believe our in-house manufacturing facility provides us with adequate capacity to manufacture our bioengineered organs while controlling our development timelines and production quality through clinical trials.
We source the porcine raw materials for our bioengineered organs from two suppliers that we have long-term relationships with. We have relationships with several OPOs to source human kidneys and livers not placed for transplant in order to isolate organ specific cells that we utilize to recellularize the ECM for our bioengineered organs. We also source certain cells from commercially available cell lines.
Government Regulation
Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which our products may be marketed. Specifically, in the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs, biologics and medical devices and requires new product approvals or clearances to assure safety and effectiveness of these products. Governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing and marketing. In the U.S., in addition to meeting FDA regulations, we are also subject to other federal laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act, as well as certain state laws.
Some human cell or tissue products that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient are regulated solely as human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue- based products (“HCT/Ps”) and do not require the FDA’s premarket review. If these cell or tissue products do not meet the FDA’s requirements for regulation solely as an HCT/P, they likely require FDA premarket review and approval of a BLA in order to be marketed. The regulatory classifications and corresponding pathways for our MiroliverELAP system and our bioengineered organ transplant products have not yet been established. The MiroliverELAP system could be classified by the FDA as a combination biological product and medical device regulated as a biologic. We are unsure whether the FDA will likewise classify our bioengineered organ transplant products as a combination biological product and medical device regulated as a biologic, or something else. It is clear that the cellular component of the MiroliverELAP system and the bioengineered organ transplant products would be considered cellular products regulated by the FDA as biological products. However, it is less clear how the FDA will regulate the extracellular matrix component, though it is possible that the FDA would view the extracellular matrix as a medical device or a xenotransplant. Regardless of how the FDA views the extracellular matrix, the cells would likely be viewed as providing the primary mode of action, which means that the products will require approved BLAs in order to be marketed in the U.S. Additionally, commercial production of these products needs to occur in FDA-registered facilities in compliance with cGMP requirements for 

14




biologics. Depending on how the FDA decides to regulate the extracellular matrix, we may be subject to additional requirements for medical devices, such as the quality system regulation for medical devices, or for xenotransplants.
Regulatory Process
The FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Obtaining approval of a BLA for a new biological product is a lengthy process leading from development of a new product through preclinical and clinical testing. This process takes a number of years and the expenditure of significant resources.
The FFDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, use, adverse event reporting, advertising and promotion of our products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications and criminal prosecution.
Product Approval
In order to obtain an FDA license for, or approval of, a new biological product or a new combination medical device biological product regulated as a biological product, sponsors must submit proof of safety, purity and potency. In most cases, such proof entails extensive nonclinical, also known as preclinical, studies in animal models and well-controlled clinical trials in human subjects. Although not explicitly part of the statutory standard for a BLA, when FDA reviews a therapeutic biologic, it evaluates whether the application has provided substantial evidence of effectiveness. The testing, preparation of necessary applications and processing of those applications by the FDA is expensive, may take several years to complete and could have uncertain outcomes. The FDA regulatory review and approval process is complex and can result in requests for additional data, increased development cost, time to market delays, or preclude us from bringing to market new products. The FDA may also require post- marketing studies and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (“REMS”) as conditions to approval. These requirements will add to the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost to sell our products, due to complex distribution and restricted commercial operations. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with applicable regulations is not maintained or if safety issues are identified during routine safety monitoring following commercialization.
Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. To conduct a clinical trial in the U.S., the study sponsor is required to submit an IND application, including the study protocol, prior to commencing human clinical trials. The submission must be supported by data, typically including the results of nonclinical, manufacturing and laboratory testing. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with Good Laboratory Practice (“cGLP”). Long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, is conducted if warranted, and its results are submitted to the IND to support a future BLA. Following the initial submission of the IND, the FDA has 30 days to review the application and raise safety and other clinical trial issues through a partial or full clinical hold. If questions or objections are not raised within that period, the clinical trial may commence according to the investigational protocol submitted to the FDA and following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for each of the clinical sites where the study will be conducted. Protocol amendments need to be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. Clinical studies can also be conducted outside of the U.S. with or without a U.S. IND. However, a clinical trial application (CTA) or IND is required to be submitted to the local competent regulatory authority to begin conducting human clinical trials. The CTA has similar data requirements to those of an IND.
For products that are regulated as biologics, the FDA requires: (i) nonclinical animal testing to establish a safety profile and/or a starting dose for initiation of clinical trials in humans; (ii) submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective prior to the initiation of human clinical trials; (iii) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product for its intended use; (iv) submission to the FDA of a BLA; and (v) review and approval of the BLA as well as pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facilities by the FDA.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may sometimes overlap:

15





● | Phase 1-The biological product is initially tested for safety and tolerability. In the case of biological products and those for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is generally conducted in healthy patients. These trials may also provide early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2-These trials are conducted in a limited number of subjects in the target population to determine a safe and effective dosage to evaluate in Phase 3 and to identify possibly related adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3-These trials are undertaken to provide evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. Phase 3 studies are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as post-marketing trials, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA has express statutory authority to require post- market clinical trials . All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements in order protect the health and safety of human subjects and for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully or within any specified period, or at all. Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHSA Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

16




After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA review and approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The BLA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the quality and manufacture of the product, including, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, of the product based on these results. If the product is deemed a combination product then the agency will also review the other constituent part during the application review. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, as well as an annual prescription drug product program user fee, which may total several million dollars and are increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs, including to review 90 percent of standard BLAs within 10 months from the date the application is filed. The FDA can refer applications for novel biologics, or biologics which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee-typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic is manufactured, or tested, as part of a pre-license inspection. The FDA will not approve the product unless it verifies that compliance with requirements for cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure and potent and provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use.
Based upon our expectation that the cellular component of the ELAP System and the bioengineered organ transplant products would be considered cellular products regulated by the FDA as biological products, the FDA also will not approve our products if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the current cGTP. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissues intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. To assure cGMP, cGTP, cGLP and cGCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter means that the BLA will not be approved in its present form and generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission. Complete responses may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The agency will review such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA approval is never guaranteed, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the regulatory requirements are not satisfied.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a biologic may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS with a biologic can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the biologic. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the biologic’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

17




Under current requirements, facilities manufacturing biological products for commercial distribution must be registered with the FDA. In addition to the preclinical studies and clinical trials, the BLA includes a description of the facilities, equipment and personnel involved in the manufacturing process. A biologics license, which is the product’s approval, is granted on the basis of inspections of the applicant’s facilities in which the primary focus is on compliance with cGMP and the ability to consistently manufacture the product in the facility in accordance with the BLA. If the FDA finds the results of the inspection unsatisfactory, it may decline to approve the BLA, resulting in a delay in production and commercialization of products.
Regulation of Combination Products in the U.S.
Certain products may be comprised of components, or constituent parts, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

● | A product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the FFDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
Regenerative Advanced Therapies
As part of the Cures Act, Congress amended the FFDCA to create a pathway to facilitate development and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHSA Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a product as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the product meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained 

18




from a meaningful number of sites. Therapies with a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation will be eligible for accelerated approval through, as appropriate:

(i) | Surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit; or
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another benefit of RMAT designation is that it creates the possibility to meet post-approval requirements beyond the standard, controlled clinical trial. Post-approval requirements can possibly be met through:

● | Clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the designation also includes early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products, devices and combination products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices, testing and other materials used in our manufacturing process for any products that we commercialize or may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products and certain combination products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, monitoring and reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, periodic reporting requirements and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. Similarly, there are a number of post-marketing requirements for devices, including medical device reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and corrections and removal reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. Additionally, devices must comply with the cGMP requirements that are set forth in the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, including complaint handling and corrective and preventative actions.
After a BLA is approved, the biological product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, and potency of biological products. After approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Further, for BLAs, changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or 

19




BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. Similarly, changes to approved or cleared devices may require FDA’s premarket review.
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, by us or our suppliers, may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, license revocation, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product and medical device manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, devices and combination products are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval, with certain exceptions.
Pediatric Research Equity Act
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or BLA supplement claiming a new indication must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, for a new product, new indication or dosage form. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations, rather than ignoring pediatric indications for adult indications that could be more economically desirable. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. By its terms, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, unless the FDA issues regulations saying otherwise. Because the FDA has not issued any such regulations, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication, and waivers are not needed at this time. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our current or future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S.. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.

Biosimilars
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. That Act created an approval pathway authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biologics, which could allow competitors to reference future data from our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval and increase the risk that our product candidates may face competition sooner than anticipated. Biosimilars are biological products which are “highly similar” to a previously approved biologic product or “reference product” and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency as shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biosimilar and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Advertising and Promotion
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and devices including regulating through standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional activities involving the internet. The agency also prohibits the off-label promotion of biologics, devices and combination products, and provides guidance on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities to ensure that these activities are not promotional. Any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity and significant penalties, including the issuance of untitled or warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, corrective advertising, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, injunctions, and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and effectiveness of a biological product or device that are consistent with the FDA approval or clearance, and the company is allowed to actively market and promote a biological product or device only for the particular use and treatment approved or cleared by the FDA.
Orphan Drug
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested to and granted by the FDA before submitting a BLA. Among the benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. However, the first applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the biologic was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity, which would most likely run concurrently with the exclusivity, if any, received from the time of first licensure of a reference product, does not prevent the FDA from approving a different biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition.

Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of biological products and devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other federal, state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the FFDCA, Anti- Kickback Statute, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and similar state laws. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a biological product manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or order of an item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti- kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our sales and marketing practices and/or our relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti- kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we have commercialized and intend to continue to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have developed a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we are subject.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, referred to as the Sunshine Act, requires biological product manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.

International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, development, commercial sales, manufacturing, and distribution of product candidates. The marketing authorization approval process and requirements vary from country to country, as do product classifications. Particularly in the area of regenerative medicines, the regulatory pathways may be unclear. The review timelines may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. As of right now, the Company is focused on product development in the U.S. and has not spent significant time or resources exploring product development in any country other than the U.S..
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials, including biological materials, which subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, or holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
Legal Proceedings
We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the results of any such disputes, and despite the potential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse material impact on us due to diversion of management time and attention as well as the financial costs related to resolving such disputes.
