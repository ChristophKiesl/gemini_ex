ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Overview and Strategy
 Helios Technologies, Inc. (“Helios,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a global industrial technology leader that develops and manufactures solutions for both the hydraulics and electronics markets. We were originally founded in 1970 as Sun Hydraulics Corporation, which designed and manufactured cartridge valves for hydraulics systems. We changed the Company’s legal name on June 13, 2019, from Sun Hydraulics Corporation to Helios Technologies, Inc.  
 Today we operate under two business segments: Hydraulics and Electronics. These businesses design and manufacture hydraulic cartridge valves, hydraulic quick release couplings and customized electronic controls systems and displays for a variety of end markets, as well as design complete hydraulic systems.  
 A little over five years ago, we set out a 10-year vision to achieve $1 billion in sales through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and to deliver operating margins in excess of 20%. 
 In addition to our expectation of compounded annual organic growth in the high single digits to low double digits, we have an active pipeline and a history of acquiring companies with niche technologies as well as strong profitability. We are augmenting our strategy with additional value streams that will help us to execute on our goals and potentially accelerate the achievement of our strategic vision. We believe the value streams will deliver growth, diversification and market leading financial performance as we develop into a more sophisticated, globally oriented, customer centric and learning organization. These are: 
  
1. | Protect the business through customer centricity and drive cash generation through the launch of new products and leveraging existing products;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Think and act globally to better leverage our assets, accelerate innovation and diversify end markets by driving intra- and inter-company initiatives and by building in the region for the region;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Create greater opportunities for growth while reducing risk and cyclicality by diversifying our markets and sources of revenue by swarming commercial opportunities that leverage our products and technologies’ value in new markets such as defense and commercial food service; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Develop our talent, our most critical resource, through a culture of customer-centricity through the embracement of diversity, engagement of the team, focus on shared, deeply rooted values and promotion of a learning organization.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy is underpinned by the execution of acquisitions which we expect to include bolt-on flywheel type acquisitions (up to $100 million in enterprise value) and the evaluation of more transformative type acquisitions ($100 million to $1 billion in enterprise value). The objective of our acquisition strategy is to enhance Helios by:
  
• | Growing our current product portfolio or adding new technologies and capabilities that complement our current offerings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding geographic presence; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | Bringing new customers or markets.
--+-----------------------------------

 To support the execution of our strategy, our financial strategy is oriented on delivering industry leading margins, a strong balance sheet and sufficient financial flexibility to support organic and acquisitive growth.
 We align our internal key performance indicators with our strategy to ensure our short-term actions will deliver long-term expectations.

A primary focus of our strategic thinking is the identification of megatrends that will impact the future capital equipment and industrial goods markets. We have identified three megatrends: globalization, growing sophistication of safe machinery and equipment and increased computing power, as further described below: 
 Globalization. We believe global population growth and urbanization, driven predominantly by Asian mega-cities, will generate ongoing demand for infrastructure projects, resources and food production, all of which require equipment and machinery from our key end markets.  
 Sophistication of safe machinery and equipment. Machine users increasingly demand safety, productivity, efficiency, and automated control. Advancements in the design of these machines require continuous evolution of critical components such as hydraulic and electronic functionality and control.  
 Increased computing power. In the current electronic and digital age, electronics are increasingly used to activate processes which were once activated only manually or mechanically. Information is increasingly being converted into a form that allows it to be processed, stored and transmitted digitally, resulting in both time and energy savings.  
 Our culture of innovation is at the core of our business. We have approximately 200 engineers in support of product innovation, as well as technical support and customer service. We believe our product innovation will aid organic growth and fill the expected demand resulting from the identified megatrends. All growth initiatives are intended to preserve Helios’s history of superior profitability and financial strength.
 Acquisitions
 We initiated our strategy to diversify and grow in 2016 with an acquisition in the electronics industry which served a variety of end markets.  Since then, our acquisitions have further diversified our product offerings and the markets we serve as well as expanded our geographic presence.

• | On December 5, 2016 we acquired Enovation Controls, LLC (“Enovation”). With this acquisition, we expanded our electronic and digital capabilities and further diversified our business, gaining access to the new, highly specialized engine driven equipment, marine and recreation vehicle markets and customers seeking complete machine control.

Business Segments
 Our Hydraulics segment includes products sold under the Sun Hydraulics, Faster and Custom Fluidpower brands. The Electronics segment includes products sold under the Enovation Controls, Murphy and Balboa Water Group brands. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  
Hydraulics
 There are three key technologies within our Hydraulics segment:  cartridge valve technology (“CVT”), quick-release hydraulic couplings solutions (“QRC”) and hydraulic system design (“Systems”). Our CVT products provide functions important to a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate and control pressures. We pioneered a fundamentally different design platform employing a floating construction that results in a self-alignment characteristic. This design provides better performance and reliability advantages compared with most competitors’ product offerings. Our cartridge valves are offered in five size ranges and include both electrically actuated and hydro-mechanical products. They are designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.  
 Hydraulic systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems, making it necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication. In response to this we have aggressively expanded our CVT offering of electrically actuated cartridge valves. In 2017, we introduced FLeX™, a new electro-hydraulic product line offering high-performance electro-hydraulic products. Since 2018, we have continued to introduce new products under the FLeX™ Series, further expanding our electro-hydraulic product offering for both the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets. 
 QRC products allow users to connect and disconnect quickly from any hydraulic circuit without leakage and ensure high-performance under high temperature and pressure using one or multiple couplers. Quick connection of multiple hydraulic lines can be accomplished through the use of a MultiFaster or casting solution. Simultaneous connection of several lines is an important feature in many applications and allows for dramatic reduction of connection time, even when the system is under pressure. We design, engineer and distribute hydraulic coupling solutions primarily in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets.  
 Systems provides engineered solutions for machine users, manufacturers or designers to fulfill complete system design requirements including electro-hydraulic, remote control, electronic control and programmable logic controller systems, as well as automation of existing equipment. The systems we manufacture:
  
• | are highly efficient;
--+----------------------


• | increase and optimize productivity;
--+------------------------------------


• | introduce safer operating procedures;
--+--------------------------------------

 5
 

 
• | are smaller in size than competitive products;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | allow for ease of maintenance; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | reduce energy costs.

Product categories include traditional mechanical and electronic gauge instrumentation, plug and go CAN-based instruments, robust environmentally sealed controllers, hydraulic controllers, pumps and water flow systems, engineered panels, process monitoring instrumentation, printed circuit board assembly and wiring harness design. Our technologies can be used in both mobile, or DC power applications, as well as fixed, or AC power applications.  
 We offer our customers the ability to customize software on their products from the graphics for our PowerView®™ line of LCD displays. Our displays offer easy-to-read, bonded LCD graphical views with the industry's best readability even in direct sunlight or harsh weather conditions. Our controllers are built with the ability to withstand a wide ambient temperature range. User friendly software configuration tools allow engineers and non-engineers alike to create customized systems that solve complex problems on their equipment making the user experience more seamless.  
 Our panel solutions offer customized design and simple, turnkey solutions and our Industrial Panel Division offers engineers dedicated to applications, wire harnesses, panels and software development. Engineers focus entirely on custom and standard solutions built to desired specifications. Our services for design and development include on-site installation and testing with reviews to ensure the solution works with the application out of the box.  
 Globally, electronics products are sold primarily direct to OEM customers, with about 25% sold through independent, authorized channel partners in 2020. We continue to implement a strategic initiative to further diversify our channels to market, our geographic reach and end markets served. In addition to acquisitions such as Balboa, this effort includes the development of distribution partners globally. These efforts assist in our ability to diversify our global customer base, allowing us to grow more quickly, diversify the end-markets we serve, and expand our customer base.
 Engineering
 Subsequent to the end of 2020, we established the Helios Center of Engineering Excellence, LLC to serve both our segments. Helios Engineering will play an important role in all aspects of our business including design, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Importantly, Helios Engineering will advance ongoing joint product development efforts to address the megatrend of the electrification of machines.

Engineering teams work cross-functionally between the segments where engineers in the Electronics segment bring expertise to enable electrification of products and systems within the Hydraulics segment. While the core value of our products have been critical to our companies’ historical success and will remain important in the future, we see significant opportunities in bringing together the technology of hydraulics and electronics to create new products to better serve future market trends.  
 Manufacturing
 Hydraulics
 We utilize process-intensive manufacturing operations that make extensive use of automated handling and assembly technology, where possible, to perform repetitive tasks, thus promoting manufacturing efficiencies and workplace safety. We employ lean techniques to continually improve our productivity and efficiency. Our hydraulics business is capital intensive which affords us the ability to choose whether we produce in-house and/or out-source component parts and finishing processes. We have manufacturing hubs in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and APAC providing “in the region, for the region” support to our customers. In 2019, we added manufacturing capacity and capability in China, further extending our global footprint as part of that element of our strategy. 
 We hold significant raw materials, work in process and finished goods in all of the businesses within the Hydraulics segment. The raw materials used, primarily aluminum and steel, are commercially available from multiple sources.  Finished goods consist of customer orders that are completed but have not been shipped.  
 We have negotiated certain long-term agreements (“LTA”) with our key suppliers. Terms and conditions of these agreements include pricing, annual quantity estimates, quality standards, safety stock quantities and lead time expectations. The LTAs are intended to provide the Company and the supplier with a framework for effective long-term planning and utilization of assets. 
 Electronics
 We offer a wide range of advanced manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including mechanical and electrical hardware design, software design, product testing, harness engineering and more. State-of-the-art manufacturing and test capabilities include LCD bonding, surface mount technology (“SMT”) with 3D solder paste inspection, 3D automated optical inspection, x-ray inspection and highly accelerated life test and highly accelerated stress screen (“HALT” and “HASS”) chambers for accelerated product lifecycle testing. Multipoint functional testing is conducted to ensure quality control of our products before they are delivered to our customers. Products are serialized, and test data is captured against serial numbers and stored in a manufacturing execution system (“MES”) database. 
 Our global operating system is tied together via an enterprise and manufacturing resource planning system, and we deploy Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma principles and tools to drive ongoing quality and productivity improvements. This allows us to identify and remove variation and waste in our manufacturing and business processes while driving continuous improvements in lead times and quality. 
 We are a customer focused, project-based organization engaging with customers in long-term product plans and contracts, backed by vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. Our strategic investment in vertically integrated manufacturing processes such as wire processing, sheet metal fabrication, LCD bonding, and surface mount technology enable speed to market in developing highly engineered electronics engine and machine control solutions for OEMs.  
 Our globally aligned raw materials and finished goods inventory strategies allow us to maintain high service levels for customers. Electronics raw materials long lead times are carefully planned and managed to ensure we meet demand.

Sales and Marketing
 In 2020, no single customer made up more than 6% of consolidated net sales across the company.  
 Hydraulics
 In 2020, 78% of Helios’s sales were derived from the Hydraulics segment. Our 2020 Hydraulics segment sales were distributed fairly evenly among our three major geographic regions with 32% to the Americas, 32% to EMEA and 36% to APAC. 
 We market and sell hydraulic products through value-add distributors and directly to OEMs. Our global channel partner network includes representation in many industrialized markets, and approximately 60% of segment sales are attributed to our channel partners who generally combine our products with other hydraulic components to design a complete hydraulic system. Sales direct to OEMs for integration in their machines make up the remaining 40%. We rely heavily on our distribution network in the U.S. with 72% of segment sales in this region going through channel partners. In EMEA and APAC, sales are split more evenly between OEMs and distributors. Technical support is provided by local experts based at each of our global operations.
 We provide end users with technical information through the websites of our operating companies and catalogs in multiple languages, including all information necessary to specify and obtain our products. We believe this approach helps stimulate demand for our products.  
 Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally both to OEM customers and through distributors. OEM sales constituted 75% of total Electronics segment sales in 2020. Building strong partnerships with OEMs is a priority. We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products. We work closely with our OEM customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications. Our hardware and software products are designed and modified with the customer utilizing our extensive application knowledge to create unique system level products that cannot be easily replaced by simply switching out components. Twenty-four-hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers.  
 Our OEM sales team collaborates with large OEMs, whereas the Distributor sales team works with a large number of distributors of varying sizes. Over the last few years, we reconstituted our sales teams to create a heavier focus on distributor sales. Overall, approximately 25% of 2020 segment sales were derived from independent, authorized distributor channel partners.
 Geographically, our 2020 Electronics segment sales represented 81% to the Americas, 9% to EMEA and 10% to APAC. There is a well-defined initiative to grow sales in EMEA and APAC as part of our growth strategy. Additionally, synergies identified at the time of acquisition utilize customer relationships from the Hydraulics segment to create pull through of electronic products, and joint product development has created additional sales opportunities for both segments.

Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories: full-line hydraulics system producers, component-only producers of CVT or QRC products, and low-cost producers. Most competitors market globally.  Full-line producers, such as Parker Hannifin and Danfoss, can provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including components functionally like those manufactured in our Hydraulics segment. Similar to Helios, component-only producers are entities that offer only CVT or QRC products, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers. These include HydraForce, Inc. and Delta Power Company.  Low-cost producers, such as Winner and Valvole Italia, are competitors who have emerged in low-cost production areas such as APAC and Europe. These competitors will typically copy our products and like products designed by competitors. Low-cost producers generally have a limited product range compared with full line or cartridge valve and quick release coupling only producers, which restricts their ability to be competitive. 
 We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multinational companies with full electronics offerings, such as Continental and Garmin, to small niche companies that specialize in one product type. Enovation Controls is a niche player in the displays, controllers, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. Balboa is a niche player providing single source control and water flow systems in the health and wellness industry. 
 The market for products designed and manufactured by Enovation Controls is relatively fragmented with the top four to six companies comprising the majority of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space. Enovation Controls differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on mid-market niche markets that are not well served by the large competitors. Our engagement and speed to market set us apart from larger competitors. 
 Balboa Water Group is the largest supplier of integrated end-to-end solutions for the therapy and wellness spa and bath market and is the only supplier capable of providing the full spectrum of components, from controls and displays to pumps and jets. By providing integrated architecture of hardware and software that is customized to match specific OEM products, Balboa creates a high cost to switch suppliers.
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up-front engineering and programming costs, and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service. 
 Human Capital
 We believe our employees are fundamental to our success. We are focused on continuing to attract and retain strong talent and furthering the development of our workforce through programs that not only enhance technical abilities but also strengthen leadership, communication and collaboration skills that contribute to our high performing, team-oriented culture. Helios is committed to attracting and developing a diverse workforce. In our core values, we believe that we should treat others as they want to be treated, fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for our colleagues and their ideas.
 At the end of our 2020 fiscal year we employed over 2,000 colleagues worldwide. Approximately 54% of our employees are located in the Americas region, 27% in the EMEA region and 19% in APAC. In addition, we have a committed service agreement with a third party that supports nearly 1,200 jobs in Mexico and serves as an integral part of our supply chain. We also hire consultants, independent contractors and temporary workers as needed to augment our workforce.

Employees are guided by our core values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Company and its employees believe that respecting others means recognizing the dignity of every person and embracing diversity around the globe. Helios is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and encourages diversity in its hiring and employment practices. Our leadership and employees strive to “do the right thing by living with integrity,” which includes caring for communities around the world and the people they employ.
 We continue to promote diversity throughout our organization. Notably, sixty percent (60%) of our executive officers are female and our executive team represents three different national origins. 
 As part of our talent development initiatives, and to support our diversity and inclusion efforts, we partner with a third-party consulting firm with whom we have developed and launched multiple programs including the Helios Leadership Development Program (“HLDP”), with employees based in six different countries. The in-depth year-long program reinforces the importance of diversity & inclusion, as well as many elements of business acumen. Also core to the program was the establishment of a global mentoring program to help guide these future leaders of our Company.
 Our employees also participate in a 3C Triad Coaching Program, a three-month online coaching program which focuses on the core elements of Coaching, Communication & Collaboration. The Triad Program goals are to build leadership capabilities while developing skills to support the growth and development of peers, and involves participants from nine countries across all of our businesses.
 The Company is committed to the safety of its employees. Each company within our group maintains environmental, health and safety policies that seek to promote the operation of our business in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and our employees. Several of our businesses have onsite medical clinics for employees and their families. Our companies offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members.
 We have approximately 440 employees in Italy who are represented by a union. We have constructive and productive dialog on a regular basis with union leaders. To the best of our knowledge, there is no labor dispute, strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending or threatened against or affecting the Company, nor is there any basis for any of the foregoing.  
 Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own approximately 270 active patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products and businesses. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights. However, our patents are important in the defense of our intellectual property from competitors who exploit product development that is not otherwise legally protected by its creator.
Governmental Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including in foreign jurisdictions, relating to our business practices, labor and employment, construction, land use, and taxation, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our company and which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 10
 
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly.
 Export Controls and Trade Policies
 We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, we are subject to trade and import and export regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). Our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, including trade restrictions, tariffs and sanctions.
Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.
Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 The Company's operations are subject to extensive and stringent governmental regulations including regulations related to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and similar safety and health regulations promulgated in other countries. The Company's employees in its manufacturing facilities operate complicated machinery that may cause substantial injury or death upon malfunction or improper operation. The Company's manufacturing locations are subject to the workplace safety rules and regulations of OSHA and local safety and health laws. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of these laws. However, in the event that the Company is unable to comply with OSHA or other environmental requirements, the Company could be subject to substantial sanctions, including restrictions on its business operations, monetary liability and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.
Sustainability
 Corporate responsibility and sustainability are reflected in the Company’s business strategy. The board of directors recently reviewed the Company’s historical commitment to principles of corporate and social responsibility. The Company is committed to reducing emissions, recycling, and minimizing its environmental footprint and has implemented several strategies to achieve these goals. The Company is also fully committed to the safety of its employees and the safety of those who use its products. Additionally, the Company actively seeks to support diversity initiatives in its hiring and employment practices. The Board and its committees will continue to assist the Company in its oversight of corporate social responsibilities, significant public policy issues, health and safety, and climate-change related trends.
