Our direct sales organizations serve customers globally across the commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor, general electronics, network test and network visibility markets.
To complement our direct sales force, we have an extensive network of channel partners around the world. These channel partners include resellers, manufacturer’s representatives and distributors. They serve thousands of customers across a wide range of end-user markets. They are expected to provide the same level of service and support as our direct sales force for the products they sell and generate new sales opportunities to extend our reach. Electronic commerce and tele‑sales channels are also in place for transactional, lower-touch sales.
For certain verticals such as network monitoring and performance management, our go-to-market solution strategy is based on strategic relationships with technical partners to provide the customer with a complete solution. In these cases, we work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
Manufacturing 
To maximize our productivity and our ability to respond to market conditions, we have significant in-house manufacturing capabilities that are supplemented by contract manufacturers. Our in-house manufacturing efforts are focused on the highest value added, more complex and highly technical aspects of production, and we use contract manufacturers for assembly, printed circuit board production, metal die-casting and plastic moulding. We have manufacturing centralized in Penang, Malaysia, our largest manufacturing facility, which focuses on the final assembly of our most sophisticated instruments and on final tuning, calibration and test of instruments across the broader portfolio. Our other principal manufacturing facilities are in California and Colorado in the United States, and outside of the United States in Germany and Japan.
We also operate three technology centers located in Santa Rosa, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Boeblingen, Germany that collectively provide key components and sub‑systems for our instruments, including microwave monolithic integrated circuits, thick and thin film circuits, optical components, high-speed probes and precision machining. Our technology centers provide a competitive advantage by developing and manufacturing differentiated technology components with performance levels that are not available commercially. We generally manufacture products after we have received firm orders for delivery.
Marketing
Keysight Global Marketing positions the company brand and drives growth through programs to increase awareness, reputation, and demand for Keysight’s software-centric test and measurement solutions in the industries we serve. We take a multi-pronged approach to building brand equity, including articulating a strong brand purpose, establishing our presence in key markets, deploying behavior-based and geo-targeting advertising to increase online reach, and maintaining leadership in worldwide earned media mentions. We support growth initiatives through high-value content, industry events and local market activities, and implement digital programs to attract new accounts. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we emphasized virtual events that enabled customers to remotely innovate and learn. We continue to expand Keysight University, an online learning platform for engineers, with courses for every career level, and have launched a Virtual Solutions Center to showcase 

solution use cases. At our premium Keysight World virtual events, we bring together customers, industry thought leaders, academics and Keysight experts to share the applications and benefits of breakthrough technologies. We continuously adopt leading-edge marketing practices, technology, and data-driven investments to stay at the forefront of the industry and maximize marketing ROI for Keysight.
Human Capital
We have a diverse, inclusive and respectful work environment, where employees are offered challenging assignments, development opportunities, competitive salaries and a safe workplace. As of October 31, 2021, we had approximately 14,300 employees worldwide representing more than 80 self-identified nationalities working across approximately 30 countries. Of those employees, 5,200 are located in North America, including 5,000 in the U.S., 2,700 are located in Europe and 6,400 are located in Asia.
Culture, Values and Standards
Our core values and culture reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and outstanding corporate citizenship. We adhere to the tenets of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and core International Labor Organization conventions, and we are an affiliate member of the Responsible Business Alliance. We comply with the labor and employment laws of all countries in which we operate, prioritizing fair employment practices, labor compliance, nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity. Our KLM is the framework for how we do business, enabling us to execute on our strategies with our customers, stockholders and employees while demonstrating our values of Speed and Courage, Uncompromising Integrity, High Performance, Social Responsibility and One Keysight. 
We believe our culture fosters employee inclusion, engagement and innovation, which we believe is a competitive advantage. We are committed to maintaining a work environment founded on respect for all in the workplace regardless of race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status, national origin, or any protected class. Our Keysight Standards of Business Conduct ("SBC") govern our dealings with our customers, competitors, suppliers, third-party partners, as well as with our fellow employees, and is available for review on our website. Our employees are responsible for upholding the SBC, and SBC training is required annually for all our employees. 
Governance and Oversight
The Chief People and Administrative Officer ("CAO") is responsible for developing and executing the company’s human capital strategy. This includes directing Keysight's global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, education and organization development, workplace strategies, and ensuring effective and efficient internal company operations. The CAO is responsible for developing and integrating the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion priorities and strategy.
The Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and CAO regularly update our board of directors and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) on human capital matters. In addition, in this past year the board of directors changed the name of the Committee from the Compensation Committee to the Compensation and Human Capital Committee and revised the Committee Charter to reflect the Committee’s increased oversight responsibility for Human Capital management.
Hiring, Retention and Succession Planning
As an engineering company, we understand that Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ("STEM") education is critical to creating a pipeline of future engineers. We support STEM education through a variety of company-sponsored and employee-led programs, such as “Introduce a Girl to Engineering” and “Expand Your Horizons,” which introduce school-age students to engineering.
Our talent acquisition and Human Resources teams work with business leaders to understand and align on business goals and strategies and how they impact our talent needs. The teams use this information to inform recruiting efforts and to build talent pipelines to support growth. In partnership with the marketing team, we have built a strong company brand utilizing multiple communication platforms, social media, and online job boards to highlight Keysight culture, our achievements, business and overall mission, all to better enable us to attract top talent.
We are continuously refining and expanding our talent acquisition strategies and processes, from interviewing to onboarding. As part of our talent acquisition strategy, we provide training to recruiters and hiring managers to assist them in recruiting and hiring top talent. “Developing Job Descriptions & Marketing Job Openings Inclusively” and “SELECT – The Neuroscience of Better Hiring” are two examples of courses available to recruiters and hiring managers. Through our global end-to-end onboarding project, we have created a smooth and simple onboarding experience for our new hires. We had a global 

job acceptance rate of 86.3 percent in fiscal year 2021. The number of software engineers in our R&D function have more than doubled since we became an independent company.
On at least an annual basis, our business leaders are required to evaluate employee contributions to the company and to identify key contributors, as well as those in need of improvement. Our annual rewards process provides each employee with feedback on their performance over the past fiscal year and rewards achievement. Working with Human Resources, business leaders develop retention strategies and initiatives to keep critical talent focused and engaged and to minimize attrition. Our business leaders re-allocate resources where needed to balance attrition, retirements and the need to source new capabilities. The average tenure of our employees is 12.7 years. Our three-year average employee turnover rate was approximately 6.2 percent and has been lower than the industry average for the past five years.
Through succession planning and leadership development, we are developing our leadership bench. We have identified core competencies for our leadership positions along with a learning and development framework that can help leaders refine those skills. The executive team is actively involved creating, reviewing and revising succession plans. Succession planning sessions are conducted annually in each business and at many levels in the organization. These reviews provide visibility to the overall leadership bench, potential gaps, top talent and development plans.
Globally, 4 percent of our employee population is eligible to retire. In the U.S. and Japan, employees eligible to retire are 27.1 percent and 15.7 percent, respectively. We recognize that many of these employees have valuable skills and historical information and that knowledge transfer is critical. As part of our knowledge transfer practices, we utilize a combination of work shadowing, paired work, coaching, documenting workflows, and cross-training. In the U.S., we have a program specifically designed to enable retirement-ready critical talent to gradually reduce hours, giving us time to transfer critical information and processes. Once retired, these former employees are given the opportunity to consult with us on a limited basis to provide on-going mentoring and training.
Diversity and Equal Employment Policy
We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion helps us attract and retain the best talent and drives high performance through innovation and collaboration. Diversity is a competitive advantage, and we strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment that fosters respect for individuals, their ideas and contributions. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives and cultures work together.
Diversity, equity and inclusion are among our CEO's top priorities. In addition to our broader diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, we set near-term objectives to increase representation of under-represented minorities. We have a Senior Director of Diversity and Inclusion who is responsible for driving implementation of new and ongoing initiatives to continue to foster a diverse and inclusive environment.
Our staffing policies underscore our commitment to diversity, ethics, integrity and compliance. In order to increase the pool of diverse candidates for open positions, we participate in diversity-focused career fairs and conferences in the U.S., Asia and Europe. We identify diversity recruiting business champions to develop business-specific talent acquisition plans, and we have partnerships with universities worldwide that are aligned with our strategic talent needs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCU") in the United States.
We seek to create an environment where employees can be successful and provide mentoring programs, inclusive benefits, support for employee network groups, and training for every stage of employment.
As of October 31, 2021, women represented 30.3 percent of our global workforce, and underrepresented minorities represented 35.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. The percentage of women in leadership positions (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President, Senior Manager, Integrating Manager, Operating Manager and Supervisor) globally was 23.4 and the percentage of underrepresented minorities was 31.4. At the senior executive level (Officer, Senior Vice President, Vice President), 18.2 percent were women and 21.6 percent were underrepresented minorities. Our Board has ten members, three of whom are women, and one is a self-identified underrepresented minority.
In the U.S., we are seeking to expand our Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American and Pacific Islander representation in our workforce. We established annual hiring goals to improve our workforce diversity. In fiscal year 2021, 34.4 percent of our global external new hires were women, falling short of our fiscal year 2021 goal of 35 percent. In fiscal year 2021, 46.4 percent of external new hires in the U.S. were underrepresented minorities, exceeding our goal of 45 percent. Our fiscal year 2022 hiring goal is intended to show improvement, with an increase to 35.4 percent global external new hires being women and 47.4 percent of external new hires in the U.S. being underrepresented minorities. A metric in our short-term executive compensation program for fiscal year 2022 is tied to the achievement of these goals. To measure achievement of 

this goal, we are using the California Assembly Bill 979 definition of underrepresented minorities, which includes Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, or gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. 
Learning and Development
We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit that creates a mindset of professional growth and continuous improvement. We emphasize on-the-job learning through stretch assignments and development opportunities as well as education. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, classes and resources to help them excel in their careers and share what they know with others. Our Keysight University platform offers training and development programs, as well as learning resources. Our Employee Educational Assistance Program provides financial and management support to eligible employees, allowing them to pursue academic degrees related to their field of work. Employees are eligible for tuition reimbursement programs and distance learning degree programs with major universities.
Many of our employees are required to take annual training courses related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy, and workplace health and safety. We also have leadership development programs available to employees, including the New Manager Training Program, Manager’s Boot Camp, and Executive Online Development Program. 
We hold an annual Keysight Executive Development ("KED") program with senior leaders to align on strategy and key focus areas for the company. Portions of these recorded sessions are then cascaded down to all Keysight employees. Our KLM was rolled out during a KED program, and subsequently over 11,500 Keysight employees have completed customized KLM training.
In addition, we expect all of our managers to complete the Yale University Fostering Inclusion & Diversity program by the end of fiscal year 2022.
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees' contributions to value creation and business results. These programs include competitive base salaries and variable pay, which reward company and individual performance; share-based equity award grants; health and welfare benefits; time-off; development programs and training; and opportunities to give back to our communities through donations of time and money. We seek to ensure pay parity across our organization. In 2021 we achieved a worldwide male to female salary ratio of nearly 1:1. We monitor our benefits programs to ensure they meet the health and welfare needs of our employees.
Listening to Employees
We provide multiple avenues for employee input. Our Open-Door Policy provides employees with direct access to any level of management to discuss ideas, get input on career development and discuss concerns in a constructive manner. The MyVoice program fosters inclusion through engagement surveys on a variety of topics that give us insight on what employees value and helps us identify where to prioritize our efforts. We also created a global Inclusion Council comprised of employees from all functions and across the globe to help formulate our goals and track our progress.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment and provide a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program, and maintaining robust emergency and disaster recovery plans. We promote the health and wellness of our employees through our Employee Well Being programs and workplace accessibility and accommodations.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we operated in accordance with three guiding principles – keep employees and their families safe and healthy, keep Keysight strong for our employees and customers, and help our communities. Our actions in response to the pandemic have been guided by these priorities. As we were making plans to return employees to our facilities, the prevalence of the Delta variant resulted in a delay of those plans. Most recently, in accordance with a Presidential mandate for federal contractors, we instituted a vaccine mandate for all U.S. employees unless they have approved medical or religious accommodations.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer. At October 31, 2021, our unfilled backlog was approximately $2,115 million as compared to approximately $1,709 million at October 31, 2020, primarily driven by strong order growth and an increase in solutions sales with a longer order-to-revenue cycle. We expect the majority of unfilled backlog to be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property 
We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark. 
Materials 
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials, such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address the potential disruption in, and other risks related to, our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of solutions for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at optimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. With the global shortages and increased lead-times for commodities such as semiconductors and passive components, we have placed orders in advance for assurance of supply. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulations
Our company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and solutions, and it is our policy to comply with the laws in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include but are not limited to those related to environment, corruption, bribery, import and export controls, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor and data privacy. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks related to government regulations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental Regulations
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur additional costs in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. ("HP") for subsurface contamination that was known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the "Separation"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the 

properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.
In connection with the Separation, Agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from Agilent to us. We cannot be sure that Agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
We maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
Import/Export Regulations
We sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with the U.S Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs limiting or banning sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations. 
On August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we will pay a penalty of $6.6 million, $2.5 million of which is suspended, over three years, and we have engaged a special compliance officer for three years. The suspended portion of the penalty will be reduced by amounts we spend on qualifying compliance activities during the three year period. Working with the special compliance officer, we will continue to develop and refine ITAR-related compliance and training programs to prevent future violations of these regulations. Changes in the law may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell certain products and solutions and may require us to develop additional compliance programs and training.
Anti-Corruption Regulations
Because we have extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs. 
Data Privacy Regulations 
With extensive operations all over the world, we must comply with complex regulations governing data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and data privacy regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations require careful handling of internal data. We have internal data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations and devote resources to keep up with changing data privacy regulations. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risk of fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs related to compliance and may restrict our business operations.
Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to and comply with health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations may differ by country, requiring us to keep track of varied and complex requirements. In the U.S. we are subject to federal and state Occupational Health and Safety laws as well as federal, state and local requirements, including specifically Executive Order 14042 (the “Order”), Ensuring Adequate Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors, which requires all U.S. employees of federal contractors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 unless they have an approved religious or medical accommodation. We have put policies and practices in place and are devoting resources to comply with the Order, which could result in loss of key personnel. Similar mandates have been issued in countries outside of the U.S. Health and safety laws, regulations and orders, including the Order, and are subject to change over time and will require monitoring and may cause us to incur additional costs related to compliance.
