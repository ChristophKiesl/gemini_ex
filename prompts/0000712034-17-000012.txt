ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the terms "ACCO Brands," "ACCO," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ACCO Brands Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005, and its consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries.
Overview of the Company
ACCO Brands is one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded business, academic and selected consumer products. Our widely recognized brands include Artline®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, Wilson Jones® and many others. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We seek to develop new products that meet the needs of our consumer and commercial end-users. We compete through a balance of product innovation, category management, a low-cost operating model and an efficient supply chain. We sell our products to consumers and commercial end-users primarily through resellers, including wholesalers and retailers, on-line retailers, and traditional office supply resellers. Our products are sold primarily to markets located in the U.S., Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 43% of our sales were outside the U.S., up from 40% in 2015.
The majority of our revenue is concentrated in geographies where demand for our product categories is in mature stages, but we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and new products. Over the long-term we expect to derive growth in faster growing emerging geographies where demand in the product categories in which we compete is strong, such as in Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. We plan to grow organically, supplemented by strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent categories. Historically, key drivers of demand for our products have included trends in white-collar employment levels, education enrollment levels, gross domestic product (GDP), growth in the number of small businesses and home offices, as well as consumer usage trends for our product categories.
We believe our leading product positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in product innovation and drive growth across our product categories. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source approximately half of our products, primarily from China.
On May 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia Stationery Industries, Inc. (the "PA Acquisition"), which indirectly owned the 50% of the Pelikan Artline joint-venture and the issued capital stock of Pelikan Artline Pty Limited (collectively, "Pelikan Artline") that was not already owned by the Company. Prior to the PA Acquisition, the Company's investment in the Pelikan Artline joint-venture was accounted for under the equity method. The results of Pelikan Artline joint-venture are included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the PA Acquisition, May 2, 2016. Pelikan Artline's product categories include writing instruments, notebooks, binding and lamination, visual communication, cleaning and janitorial supplies, as well as general stationery. Its industry-leading brands include Artline®, Quartet®, GBC®, Spirax® and Texta®, among others. Pelikan Artline is currently being integrated with our existing businesses in Australia and New Zealand.
On January 31, 2017, ACCO Europe, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its previously announced acquisition (the "Esselte Acquisition") of Esselte Group Holdings AB ("Esselte"). The results of Esselte are not included in the 2016 results. For further information, see "Note 20. Subsequent Events" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.
Reportable Segments
The Company's three business segments are described below.
ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International
ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International design, market, source, manufacture and sell traditional office products, academic supplies and calendar products. ACCO Brands North America comprises the U.S. and Canada, and ACCO Brands International comprises the rest of the world, primarily Northern Europe, Australia, Brazil and Mexico.
1

Our business, academic and calendar product lines use name brands such as Artline®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, NOBO®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, Wilson Jones® and many others. Products and brands are not confined to one channel or product category and are sold based on end-user preference in each geographic location.
The majority of our office products, such as stapling, binding and laminating equipment and related consumable supplies, shredders and whiteboards, are used by businesses. Most of these end-users purchase their products from our customers, which include traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and other retailers, including on-line retailers. We supply some of our products directly to large commercial and industrial end-users, and provide business machine maintenance and certain repair services. Additionally, we supply some similar private label products.
Our academic products include notebooks, folders, decorative calendars and stationery products. We distribute our academic products primarily through mass merchandisers and other retailers, such as grocery, drug and office superstores, as well as on-line retailers. We also distribute to small independent retailers in emerging markets and supply some private label academic products.
Our calendar products are sold through all the same channels where we sell business or academic products, as well as directly to consumers, both on-line and through direct mail.
Computer Products Group
Our Computer Products Group designs, sources, distributes, markets and sells accessories for laptop and desktop computers and tablets. These accessories primarily include security products, input devices such as presenters, mice and trackballs, ergonomic aids such as foot and wrist rests, docking stations, and other PC and tablet accessories. We sell these products mostly under the Kensington®, Microsaver® and ClickSafe® brand names, with the majority of revenue coming from the U.S. and Northern Europe. Our computer products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, principally in Asia, and are distributed from our regional facilities. Our computer products are sold primarily to consumer electronics retailers, information technology value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, and office products retailers, as well as directly to consumers on-line.
For further information on our business segments see "Note 16. Information on Business Segments" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.
Customers/Competition
Our sales are generated principally in the U.S., Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 43% of our net sales were outside the U.S. Our top ten customers accounted for 56% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales to Staples, our largest customer, amounted to approximately 14%, 14% and 13% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales to Wal-Mart amounted to approximately 10% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales to Office Depot amounted to approximately 10% and 11% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Sales to Office Depot were below 10% for the year ended December 31, 2016. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business serves a limited number of large and sophisticated customers, and a substantial reduction in sales to one or more of these customers could adversely impact our operating results," and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Our customers are primarily large global and regional resellers of our products including traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers, on-line retailers and other retailers. Mass merchandisers and retail channels primarily sell to individual consumers but also to small businesses. We also sell to office supply retailers, commercial contract dealers, wholesalers, distributors and independent dealers who primarily serve commercial end-users. Over half of our product sales by our customers are to commercial end-users, who generally seek premium products that have added value or ease-of-use features and a reputation for reliability, performance and professional appearance. Some of our binding and laminating equipment products are sold directly to high-volume end-users and commercial reprographic centers. We also sell directly to consumers.
Current trends among our customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times and in smaller quantities. Another trend is for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and sell those products, which compete with our products, under the retailer's own private-label brands. Our increased focus on the mass channel and sales growth with on-line retailers has helped to partially offset declines in the office superstore and wholesaler channels due to consolidation and channel shifts. Historically, large office superstores and wholesalers have maintained a significant market share in business, academic and dated goods, but these customers are experiencing increasing competition from mass merchandisers and on-line 
2

retailers. The combination of these market influences, along with a continuing trend of consolidation among office superstores, resellers and wholesalers has created an intensely competitive environment in which our principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers they use. This results in pricing pressures and the need for stronger end-user brands, broader product penetration within categories, ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in customer service.
Competitors of our ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International segments include 3M, Blue Sky, Carolina Pad, CCL Industries, Dominion Blueline, Fellowes, Franklin Covey, Hamelin, House of Doolittle, LSC Communications, Newell Rubbermaid, Smead, Spiral Binding and numerous private label suppliers and importers. Competitors of the Computer Products Group include Belkin, Fellowes, Logitech, Targus and Zagg.
See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our historical office superstore and wholesale customers may further transform their business models, which could adversely impact our sales and margins," "- Shifts in the channels of distribution for our products could adversely impact our business," "- Challenges related to the highly competitive business segments in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our ongoing business, results of operation and financial condition," "- Our success partially depends on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands, including price expectations," and "- The market for computer products is rapidly changing and highly competitive."
Certain financial information for each of our business segments and geographic regions is incorporated by reference to "Note 16. Information on Business Segments" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.
Product Development
Our strong commitment to understanding our consumers and defining products that fulfill their needs drives our product development strategy, which we believe is and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Our new products are developed from our own consumer understanding, our own research and development or through partnership initiatives with inventors and vendors. Costs related to consumer and product research when paid directly by ACCO Brands are included in marketing costs and research and development expenses, respectively. Research and development expenses amounted to $21.0 million, $20.0 million and $20.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 1.3%, 1.3% and 1.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our success partially depends on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands, including price expectations."
We consistently review our businesses and product offerings, assess their strategic fit and seek opportunities to divest nonstrategic businesses and rationalize our product offerings. The criteria we use in assessing the strategic fit include: the ability to increase sales for the business; the ability to create strong, differentiated brands; the importance of the business to key customers; the business's relationship with existing product lines; the importance of the business to the market; and the business's actual and potential impact on our operating performance. See also "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Raw Materials
The primary materials used in the manufacturing of many of our products are paper, plastics, resin, polyester and polypropylene substrates, steel, wood, aluminum, melamine, zinc and cork. These materials are available from a number of suppliers, and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials. Based on our experience, we believe that adequate quantities of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks associated with currency volatility could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flow and results of operations," "- Fluctuation in the costs of raw materials, labor and transportation and changes in international shipping capacity as well as issues affecting port availability and efficiency, such as labor strikes, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition," and "- Changes to current policies by the U.S. government could adversely affect our business."

Supply
Our products are either manufactured or sourced to ensure that we supply our customers with appropriate customer service, quality products, innovative solutions and attractive pricing. We have built a customer-focused business model with a flexible supply chain to ensure that these factors are appropriately balanced. Using a combination of manufacturing and third-party sourcing also enables us to reduce our costs and effectively manage our production assets by lowering capital investment and working capital requirements. Our strategy is to manufacture locally those products that would incur a relatively high freight and/or duty expense or have high service needs and source those products that have a high proportion of direct labor cost. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source the remaining half. Low-cost sourcing primarily comes from China, but we also source from other Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe.
Seasonality
Historically, our business has experienced higher sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Two principal factors contribute to this seasonality: (1) we are a major supplier of products related to the "back-to-school" season, which occurs principally from June through September for our North American business and from November through February for our Australian and Brazilian businesses; and (2) several products we sell lend themselves to calendar year-end purchase timing, including AT-A-GLANCE® planners, paper organization and storage products (including bindery) and Kensington® computer accessories, which have higher sales in the fourth quarter driven by traditionally strong fourth-quarter sales of personal computers and tablets. As a result, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, most of our earnings in the second half of the year and much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters as receivables are collected.

Sales Percentages by Fiscal Quarter | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
1st Quarter | 18 | % | | 19 | % | 20 | %
2nd Quarter | 26 | % | | 26 | % | 25 | %
3rd Quarter | 28 | % | | 28 | % | 28 | %
4th Quarter | 28 | % | | 27 | % | 27 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition."
Intellectual Property
We have many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to our business. The loss of any individual patent or license, however, would not be material to any business segment or to the Company as a whole. Many of ACCO Brands' trademarks are only important in particular geographic markets or regions. Our principal registered trademarks are: ACCO®, Artline®, AT-A-GLANCE®, ClickSafe®, Derwent®, Esselte®, Five Star®, GBC®, Hilroy®, Kensington®, Leitz®, Marbig®, Mead®, MicroSaver® NOBO®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Rexel®, Swingline®, Tilibra®, and Wilson Jones®. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our inability to secure, protect and maintain rights to intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our business."
Environmental Matters
We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling, disposal and clean-up of waste materials and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. In the opinion of our management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition and results of operations or competitive position. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to global environmental regulation and environmental risks, product content and product safety laws and regulations, international trade laws and regulations as well as laws, regulations and self-regulatory requirements relating to privacy and data security."
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,040 full-time and part-time employees. There have been no strikes or material labor disputes at any of our facilities during the past five years. We consider our employee relations to be good.
