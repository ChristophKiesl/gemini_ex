Item 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
 
Contango ORE, Inc. (“CORE” or the “Company”) engages in exploration for gold, silver, and copper ores in the State of Alaska. The Company’s largest asset is a 30.0% membership interest in Peak Gold, LLC (the “Joint Venture Company”), which leases approximately 675,000 acres from the Tetlin Tribal Council and approximately 13,000 acres of State of Alaska mining claims (the “Manh Choh Joint Venture Property,” which the Company previously referred to as the “Peak Gold Joint Venture Project”) for exploration and development and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CORE Alaska, LLC (“CORE Alaska”). The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC (“Contango Minerals”), owns a 100% interest in the mineral rights to approximately 200,000 acres of State of Alaska mining claims located north and northwest of the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property (the “Contango Property”).  As of June 30, 2021 the Company had approximately $35.2 million in cash and is actively working to acquire additional properties in Alaska for exploration.  The acquisitions may include leases or similar rights from Alaska Native corporations or may include filing Federal or State of Alaska mining claims by staking claims for exploration.
 
In February 2021, the Village of Tetlin Tribal Council approved of a new name, the “Manh Choh Project,” for the Peak Gold Joint Venture Project.  The renaming was a result of close consultation with the local Upper Tanana Athabascan Village of Tetlin on whose land the project is situated.  The name “Manh  Choh” (“mon-CHO”) can be translated from the Upper Tanana Athabascan language to “Big Lake,” referring to the nearby Tetlin Lake, a site of high cultural and subsistence significance for the community. 
 

Kinross Transaction
 
On September 29, 2020, the Company, CORE Alaska, LLC and KG Mining (Alaska), Inc. (“KG Mining”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “CORE Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which CORE Alaska sold a 30.0% membership interest (the “CORE JV Interest”) in the Joint Venture Company, to KG Mining (the “CORE Transactions”). The CORE Transactions closed on September 30, 2020.  In consideration for the CORE JV Interest, the Company received $32.4 million in cash and 809,744 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”). The 809,744 shares of Common Stock had been acquired by KG Mining from Royal Gold, as part of the Royal Gold Transactions (described below) and were subsequently canceled by the Company. Of the $32.4 million cash consideration, $1.2 million constituted a reimbursement prepayment to the Company by KG Mining of amounts relating to CORE Alaska’s proportionate share of certain silver royalty payments that the Joint Venture Company may be obligated to pay to Royal Gold, with the understanding that as a result of such reimbursements, KG Mining would bear the entire economic impact of those silver royalty payments due from the Joint Venture Company.  Concurrently with the CORE Purchase Agreement, KG Mining acquired 100% of the equity of Royal Alaska, LLC (“Royal Alaska”) from Royal Gold, which held a 40.0% membership interest in the Joint Venture Company.  As of June 30, 2021, the Company held a 30.0% membership interest, and KG Mining held a 70.0% membership interest, in the Joint Venture Company. 
 
Immediately prior to the Kinross Transactions (described below), the Joint Venture Company, the Company, Contango Minerals, CORE Alaska, Royal Gold and Royal Alaska entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Joint Venture Company completed the formation of Contango Minerals and contributed approximately 167,000 acres of Alaska state mining claims to it, subject to an Option Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Option Agreement”). Under the Option Agreement, Contango Minerals granted the Joint Venture Company an option, subject to certain conditions contained in the Option Agreement, to purchase approximately 13,000 acres of the Alaska state mining claims which were contributed to Contango Minerals pursuant to the Separation Agreement, together with all extralateral rights, water and water rights, and easements and rights of way in connection therewith, that are held by Contango Minerals.  As a result, at the closing of the CORE Transactions, the Company received the equity of Contango Minerals and control of approximately 167,000 acres of Alaska state mining claims.  Peak Gold subsequently exercised the Option Agreement and now owns the 13,000 acres of the Alaska state mining claims previously subject to the Option Agreement.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the CORE Transactions, KG Mining, in a separate transaction, acquired from Royal Gold (i) 100% of the equity of Royal Alaska, which held a 40.0% membership interest in the Joint Venture Company and (ii) 809,744 shares of Common Stock held by Royal Gold (the “Royal Gold Transactions” and, together with the CORE Transactions, the “Kinross Transactions”).  After the consummation of the Kinross Transactions, CORE Alaska retained a 30.0% membership interest in the Joint Venture Company. KG Mining now holds a 70.0% membership interest in the Joint Venture Company and serves as the manager and operator of the Joint Venture Company. KG Mining and CORE Alaska entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Joint Venture Company (the “A&R JV LLCA”) on October 1, 2020 to address the new ownership arrangements and to incorporate additional terms that will permit the Joint Venture Company to further develop and produce from its properties.
 
Kinross is a large gold producer with a diverse global portfolio and extensive operating experience in Alaska. The Joint Venture Company plans to mine ore from the Peak and North Peak deposits and then process ore at the existing Fort Knox mining and milling complex located approximately 250 miles away. The use of the Fort Knox mill is expected to accelerate the development of the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property and result in significantly reduced upfront capital development costs, smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline and less overall risk for Manh Choh Joint Venture Property.
 
Background
 
On January 8, 2015, the Company and a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”) formed the Joint Venture Company. The Company contributed a 100% leasehold interest in an estimated 675,000 acres (the “Tetlin Lease”) from the Tetlin Tribal Council, the council formed by the governing body for the Native Village of Tetlin, an Alaska Native Tribe (the “Tetlin Tribal Council”); and State of Alaska mining claims near Tok, Alaska (together with other property, formerly the “Peak Gold Joint Venture Property”), and Royal Gold made an initial investment into the Joint Venture Company of $5.0 million. By September 29, 2020, Royal Gold had contributed approximately $37.1 million to the Joint Venture Company and earned a cumulative economic interest of 40.0%.  The proceeds from the investments were used for exploration of the Peak Gold Joint Venture Property. Royal Gold served as the manager of the Joint Venture Company and managed, directed, and controlled operations of the Joint Venture Company until the Kinross Transactions.
 
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $35.2 million of cash.  On December 10, 2020, the Management Committee of the Joint Venture Company (the “Management Committee”) approved a total budget of $18.0 million for the calendar year 2021 to undertake in-fill drilling, engineering and environmental studies necessary to complete a feasibility-level study, additional exploration, community relations, and to prepare the project for formal permitting.  On June 22, 2021 the Management Committee voted to increase the exploration budget by $0.2 million for interpretation of archive drilling, adopting oriented core and geological consulting.  The Company’s proportionate share of the approved budget is approximately $5.5 million. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had funded approximately $2.5 million to the Joint Venture Company during calendar year 2021.  In addition, the Company plans to fund an approximately $3.0 million exploration program to continue its exploration efforts on its earlier stage Eagle and Hona projects located immediately north of the Manh Choh project area, and to explore for additional resources on 100%-owned Triple Z prospect in late 2021, focused on the areas immediately adjacent to the known Joint Venture Company resources.  Field work on the Eagle/Hona project began in July 2021.  During the first quarter of calendar year 2021, the Company staked a new property called Shamrock in the Richardson Mining District located in central Alaska right along the Alaska Hwy corridor approximately 70 miles from Fairbanks, Alaska.  The property includes a total of 361 Alaska state mining claims covering approximately 52,640 acres and gives the Company a dominant land position in the Richardson district.  The property has excellent infrastructure being right along the Alaska Hwy and adjacent to the Trans Alaska Pipeline with several gravel roads and ATV trails providing good access to entire property. 
 
Properties
 
Since 2009, the Company’s primary focus has been the exploration of a mineral lease with the Native Village of Tetlin whose governmental entity is the Tetlin Tribal Council (“Tetlin Tribal Council”) for the exploration of minerals near Tok, Alaska on a currently estimated 675,000 acres (the “Tetlin Lease”) constituting the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property and almost all of the Company’s resources have been directed to that end. All significant work presently conducted by the Company has been directed at exploration of the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property and increasing understanding of the characteristics of, and economics of, any mineralization. The Company also separately owns the mineral rights to approximately 200,000 acres of State of Alaska mining claims for exploration. There are no known quantifiable mineral reserves on the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property, the Contango Property or any of the Company’s other properties as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7.

The Tetlin Lease originally had a ten-year term beginning July 2008, which was extended for an additional ten years to July 15, 2028. If the properties under the Tetlin Lease are placed into commercial production, the Tetlin Lease will be held throughout production and the Company would be obligated to pay a production royalty to the Tetlin Tribal Council, which varies from 3.0% to 5.0%, depending on the type of metal produced and the year of production. In June 2011, the Company paid the Tetlin Tribal Council $75,000 in exchange for reducing the production royalty payable to them by 0.25%. In July 2011, the Company paid the Tetlin Tribal Council an additional $150,000 in exchange for further reducing the production royalty by 0.50%. These payments lowered the production royalty to a range of 2.25% to 4.25%, depending on the type of metal produced and the year of production. The Tetlin Tribal Council had the option to increase its production royalty by (i) 0.25% by payment to the Joint Venture Company of $150,000, (ii) 0.50% by payment to the Joint Venture Company of $300,000, or (iii) 0.75% by payment to the Joint Venture Company of $450,000.  The Tetlin Tribal Council exercised this option on December 30, 2020.  In lieu of a cash payment, the $450,000 will be credited against future production royalty and advance minimum royalty payments due by the Joint Venture Company to the Tetlin Tribal Council under the lease once production begins. 
 
The Joint Venture Company has also historically held certain State of Alaska unpatented mining claims for the exploration of gold ore and associated minerals.  Prior to the Kinross Transactions, the Joint Venture Company, Contango Minerals Alaska, LLC, an Alaska limited liability company formed by the Joint Venture Company (“Contango Minerals”), the Company, CORE Alaska, Royal Gold and Royal Alaska entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Joint Venture Company formed Contango Minerals, contributed approximately 167,000 acres of Alaska state mining claims to it (Eagle, Noah, Triple Z, and Tok), and retained an additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty interest on certain of the Alaska state mining claims that were contributed. After the formation and contribution to Contango Minerals, the Joint Venture Company made simultaneous distributions to Royal Alaska and CORE Alaska by (i) granting a new 28.0% net smelter returns silver royalty on all silver produced from a defined area within the Tetlin Lease and transferring the additional 1.0% net smelter returns royalty described above to Royal Gold and (ii) assigning 100.0% of the membership interests in Contango Minerals to CORE Alaska, which were in turn distributed to the Company, resulting in Contango Minerals becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Separation Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.
 
In connection with the Separation Agreement, the Joint Venture Company and Contango Minerals entered into an Option Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Option Agreement”). Under the Option Agreement, Contango Minerals granted to the Joint Venture Company the option, subject to certain conditions contained in the Option Agreement, to purchase approximately 13,000 acres of the Alaska state mining claims, together with all extralateral rights, water and water rights, and easements and rights of way in connection therewith, that are held by Contango Minerals, and which were transferred to Contango Minerals pursuant to the Separation Agreement.  Subject to the conditions in the Option Agreement, the Joint Venture Company had the right exercise the option to purchase the Alaska state mining claims, in whole or in part, at an exercise price of $50,000.  The Joint Venture Company exercised the option in June 2021, and paid the Company 50,000 for all of the Alaska state mining claims outlined in the Option Agreement.
 
The Company believes that it and the Joint Venture Company hold good title to their properties, in accordance with standards generally accepted in the mineral industry. As is customary in the mineral industry, the Company conducted only a preliminary title examination at the time it entered into the Tetlin Lease. The Joint Venture Company conducted a title examination prior to the assignment of the Tetlin Lease to the Joint Venture Company and performed certain curative title work.  Before the Joint Venture Company begins any mine development work, however, the Joint Venture Company is expected to again conduct a full title review and perform curative work on any defects that it deems significant. A significant amount of additional work is likely required in the exploration of the properties before any determination as to the economic feasibility of a mining venture can be made.
 
The following table summarizes the Tetlin Lease and unpatented mining claims held by the Joint Venture Company and the Company as of June 30, 2021 :

Strategy
 
Retaining Proven Executive Leadership.  Effective as of January 6, 2020, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse was appointed to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse will perform the functions of the Company’s principal executive officer.  Also effective on January 6, 2020, the size of the Board was increased from four to five directors with Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the increase.  Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse, 65, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trilogy Metals Inc. from January 2012 until December 2019. Between May 1999 and January of 2012, he served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of NOVAGOLD Resources, Inc.  In December 2020, Mr.  Van Nieuwenhuyse hired two employees to assist with the execution and field management of the Company's exploration of its 100% owned properties. 
 
Partnering with strategic industry participants to expand future exploration work. In January 2015, the Company formed the Joint Venture Company pursuant to the JV LLCA with Royal Gold. Under the JV LLCA, Royal Gold was appointed as the manager of the Joint Venture Company, initially, with overall management responsibility for operations of the Joint Venture Company. As of October 1, 2020, in conjunction with the Kinross Transactions and the signing of the A&R JV LLCA, KG Mining became the manager of the Joint Venture Company (the “Manager”).  KG Mining may resign as Manager and can be removed as Manager for a material breach of the A&R JV LLCA, a material failure to perform its obligations as the Manager, a failure to conduct the Joint Venture Company operations in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws, and other limited circumstances. The Manager will manage and direct the operation of the Joint Venture Company, and will discharge its duties, in accordance with approved programs and budgets. The Manager will implement the decisions of the Management Committee and will carry out the day-to-day operations of the Joint Venture Company. Except as expressly delegated to the Manager, the A&R JV LLCA provides that the Management Committee has exclusive authority to determine all management matters related to the Company. The Management Committee currently consists of one appointee designated by the Company and two appointees designated by KG Mining.  The Representatives designated by each member of the Joint Venture Company vote as a group, and in accordance with their respective membership interests in the Joint Venture Company. Except in the case of certain actions that require approval by unanimous vote of the Representatives, the affirmative vote of a majority of the membership interests in the Joint Venture Company constitutes the action of the Management Committee.
 
Structuring Incentives to Drive Behavior. The Company believes that equity ownership aligns the interests of the Company’s executives and directors with those of its stockholders. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s directors and executives beneficially own approximately 23.5% of the Company’s Common Stock. An additional 11.8% of the Company’s Common Stock is beneficially owned by the Marital Trust of Mr. Kenneth R. Peak, the Company’s former Chairman, who passed away on April 19, 2013.
 
Acquiring exploration properties.  The Company anticipates from time to time acquiring additional properties in Alaska for exploration, subject to the availability of funds. The acquisitions may include leases or similar rights from Alaska Native corporations or may include filing Federal or State of Alaska mining claims by staking claims for exploration. Acquiring additional properties will likely result in additional expense to the Company for minimum royalties, minimum rents and annual exploratory work requirements.

Exploration and Mining Property
 
Exploration and mining rights in Alaska may be acquired in the following manner: public lands, private fee lands, unpatented Federal or State of Alaska mining claims, patented mining claims, and tribal lands. The primary sources for acquisition of these lands are the United States government, through the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, the Alaskan state government, tribal governments, and individuals or entities who currently hold title to or lease government and private lands.
 
Tribal lands are those lands that are under control by sovereign Native American tribes. Areas that show promise for exploration and mining can be leased from or joint ventured with the tribe controlling the land, including land constituting the Tetlin Lease.
 
The State of Alaska government owns public lands. Mineral resource exploration, development and production are administered primarily by the State Department of Natural Resources. Ownership of the subsurface mineral estate, including alluvial and lode mineral rights, can be acquired by staking a 40 -acre or 160 -acre mining claim, which right is granted under Alaska Statute Sec. 38.05.185 to 38.05.275, as amended. The State of Alaska government continues to own the surface estate, subject to certain rights of ingress and egress owned by the claimant, even though the subsurface can be controlled by a claimant with a right to extract through claim staking. A mining claim is subject to annual assessment work requirements, the payment of annual rental fees and royalties due to the State of Alaska after commencement of commercial production. Both private fee-land and unpatented mining claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to permitting requirements of federal, state, tribal and local governments.
 
Services Provided by Tetlin Village Members
 
Since the start of the term of the Tetlin Lease, the Company has worked closely with the Tetlin Tribal Council to train and employ Tetlin Tribal members and their family members during the Joint Venture Company’s project exploration programs. During the Joint Venture Company’s exploration programs, there were typically 10 to 15 Tetlin residents working on the Joint Venture Company’s project employed on a seasonal basis through Avalon. Their duties included reconnaissance soil, stream sediment and pan concentrate sampling, diamond drill core processing, drill pad construction and related tasks, expediting services, food services, database management, vehicle transportation and maintenance services, reclamation activities, and project management tasks.

Community Affairs
  
In April 2015, the Joint Venture Company entered into a Community Support Agreement (as amended, the “Support Agreement”) with the Tetlin Village for a one-year period, which was extended for two additional two-year periods under the same terms. Under the extended Support Agreement, the Joint Venture Company provided payments to the Tetlin Village four times during the year for an aggregate amount of $110,000 through January 1, 2017, and an additional $100,000 each year through January 1, 2020.   The Support Agreement has been extended for two additional one-year periods under the same terms.  Under the latest extension, the Joint Venture Company will provide payments to the Tetlin Village four times during the year for an aggregate amount of $100,000 through January 1, 2022.  The Support Agreement defines agreed uses for the funds and auditing rights regarding use of funds. In addition, the Joint Venture Company supports the Tetlin Village in maintenance of the village access road, which is used by the Joint Venture Company. 
Adverse Climate Conditions
 
Weather conditions affect the Company’s and the Joint Venture Company’s ability to conduct exploration activities and mine any ore from the Contango Property and the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property in Alaska. While the Company believes exploration, development work and any subsequent mining may be conducted year-round, the arctic climate limits many exploration and mining activities during certain seasons.
Competition
 
The Company currently faces strong competition for the acquisition of any new exploration-stage properties as well as extraction of any minerals in Alaska. Numerous larger mining companies actively seek out and bid for mining prospects as well as for the services of third party providers and supplies, such as mining equipment and transportation equipment. The Company’s competitors in the exploration, development, acquisition and mining business will include major integrated mining companies as well as numerous smaller mining companies, almost all of which have significantly greater financial resources and in-house technical expertise. In addition, the Company will compete with others in efforts to obtain financing to explore our mineral properties.
Government Regulation
 
The Company and the Joint Venture Company’s mineral exploration activities are generally affected by various laws and regulations, including environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to the exploration of minerals. Various federal and Alaskan laws and regulations often require permits for exploration activities and also cover extraction of minerals. In addition, the Tetlin Lease is located on land leased from the Tetlin Tribal Council. Federally recognized Native American tribes are independent governments, with sovereign powers, except to the extent those powers may have been limited by treaty or by the United States Congress. Such tribes maintain their own governmental systems and often their own judicial systems and have the right to tax, and to require licenses and to impose other forms of regulation and regulatory fees, on persons and businesses operating on their lands. As sovereign nations, federally recognized Native American tribes are generally subject only to federal regulation. States do not have the authority to regulate them, unless such authority has been specifically granted by Congress, and state laws generally do not directly apply to them and to activities taking place on their lands, unless they have a specific agreement or compact with the state or federal government allowing for the application of state law. The Company believes that the Joint Venture Company will continue to use its best efforts to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but the denial of permits required to explore for or mine ore may prevent it from realizing any revenues arising from the presence of minerals on its properties.
Environmental Regulation
 
The Company believes that the Joint Venture Company is currently operating in compliance with all environmental regulations. While the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Office of Project Management and Permitting coordinates the permitting of mine projects on state lands, it has no jurisdiction on Native American land such as the Tetlin Lease. However, the Joint Venture Company has voluntarily elected, with the concurrence of the Tetlin Tribal Council, to conduct its mineral exploration activities under the same terms and conditions as required on State of Alaska mining claims.
 
Hard Rock Exploration Permits and Temporary Water Use Permits covering past and planned activities on the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property were issued by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources to the Company and the Joint Venture Company and consist of the following multi-year permits:
 

1. | Alaska Hard Rock Exploration and Reclamation Permit #2626 covering exploration drilling activities on the Tetlin Lease. This permit now extends through December 31, 2025. Each year during the term of the permit, the Joint Venture Company will submit a reclamation statement detailing reclamation actions taken and a letter of intent to do reclamation for the following year.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Alaska Temporary Water Use Permit F2020-093, allowing a maximum withdrawal of 12,000 gallons per day. The permit expires December 31, 2025. These water use authorizations are specific to Alaska Hard Rock Exploration permit #2626. 
3. | Alaska Mining Permit Application (APMA) F192900 covering exploration activities for a 5-year period on the Hona Exploration Project was received on August 6, 2019. 
4. | Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G), Habitat Division issued the Fish Habitat Permit FH19-III-0117 for activities associated with F192900 on June 4. The Fish Habitat Permit will expire on December 31, 2023. 
5. | Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR), Division of Mining, Land and Water issued a Temporary Water Use Authorization (TWUA) for the Hona exploration area on August 12, 2019. 

 
   7

 

The above referenced State of Alaska permits were issued to the Company and assigned to the Joint Venture Company to cover its access road, drill pad and core drilling impacts. The Company does not anticipate that the Joint Venture Company will require additional permits from the State of Alaska for the remainder of the 2021 calendar year. Reclamation of surface disturbance, if any, associated with our exploration activities is conducted concurrently where required.
 
The Joint Venture Company also has received a Nationwide Permit #6, Permit #POA-2013-286, from the U.S. Department of the Army Corps of Engineers with respect to the Joint Venture Company’s intended drilling and access-related disturbances on wetlands within the Tetlin Lease, which is valid through December 31, 2022. However, such lands were classified as wetlands more than 20 years ago and much of the land covered by such permit has since been burned by natural wildfires. As a consequence of the wildfires and natural habitat changes that have taken place since the wildfires, the Manh Choh Joint Venture Property may no longer be considered wetlands according to Corps of Engineers guidelines. 
 
The Company began collecting baseline environmental data in 2012 and the Joint Venture Company has continued this process. The Joint Venture Company has not developed a comprehensive environmental permitting strategy as the Joint Venture Company remains in an exploration stage. If and when its exploration work is significantly advanced that additional baseline environmental studies and prefeasibility studies are desirable, the Joint Venture Company will be required to expend considerable funds and resources for an environmental impact statement and related studies to advance any mining project.
 
Any future mining operations are subject to local, state and federal regulation governing environmental quality and pollution control, including air quality standards, greenhouse gas, waste management, reclamation and restoration of properties, plant and wildlife protection, cultural resource protection, handling and disposal of radioactive substances, and employee health and safety. Extraction of mineral ore is subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Such regulation can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating mining facilities or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit planned operations.
 
Significant fines and penalties may be imposed for failure to comply with environmental laws. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of releases of hazardous substances. In addition, the Joint Venture Company may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damages as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances.
 
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the State of Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, impose a variety of health and safety standards on numerous aspects of employee working conditions related to mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures and operating equipment. In addition, the Joint Venture Company may be subject to additional state and local mining standards. The Company believes that the Joint Venture Company currently is in compliance with applicable mining standards; however, the Company cannot predict whether changes in standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Joint Venture Company’s business, financial condition or otherwise impose restrictions on its ability to conduct mining operations.
 
A typical time frame for baseline environmental studies and permitting for a gold mine in Alaska may consume a decade or more. There are numerous state and federal permits and authorizations required from many different state and federal agencies. Federal legislation and regulations adopted and administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Mine Safety and Health Administration, and other federal agencies, legislation such as the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and various laws and regulations administered by the State of Alaska including the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, have a direct bearing on exploration and mining operations conducted in Alaska. These regulations will make the process for preparing and obtaining approval of a plan of operations much more time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources coordinates the permitting of mining operations in the State of Alaska, has developed a process to integrate federal, state and local government requirements to obtain mine permits, and also provides an opportunity for public comment. Plans of operation will be required to include detailed baseline environmental information and address how detailed reclamation performance standards will be met. In addition, all activities for which plans of operation are required will be subject to a new standard of review by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which must make a finding that the conditions, practices or activities do not cause substantial irreparable harm to significant scientific, cultural, or environmental resource values that cannot be effectively mitigated.
 
CERCLA generally imposes joint and several strict liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, with respect to the release of hazardous substances (as designated under CERCLA) into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases, third parties, to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such action. The Joint Venture Company’s mining operations may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of “Hazardous Substances”.
