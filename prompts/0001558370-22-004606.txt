Overview

We are a precision genetic medicine company dedicated to our mission of developing gene therapies with the potential to restore, improve, and preserve high-acuity physiologic hearing for individuals who live with disabling hearing loss worldwide. We have built a precision genetic medicine platform that incorporates a proprietary vector library consisting of variants of a small virus commonly used in gene therapy, known as adeno-associated virus, or AAV, and a novel delivery approach. We are executing on our core strategic initiatives, which include the advancement of our lead product candidate, AK-OTOF; expansion of our pipeline to include programs focused on other monogenic conditions as well as inner ear conditions of complex etiology, such as AK-antiVEGF for vestibular schwannoma; and development of internal manufacturing capabilities and, ultimately, a commercial infrastructure. We believe the genetic medicines we are developing have the potential to create a new standard of care for, and to transform the lives of individuals and their families, with disabling hearing loss, by providing a meaningful alternative to the invasive and limited current non-pharmacologic treatments. Our aim is to leverage our capabilities to become a fully integrated biotechnology company. We believe our platform and our team together provide a unique advantage to efficiently develop potential genetic medicines for a variety of inner ear conditions. 
              Hearing loss is one of the world’s largest unmet medical needs. Approximately 466 million people around the world, including 34 million children, live with disabling hearing loss, and a growing body of evidence suggests hearing loss can have a significant impact on cognitive development, psychiatric health, and healthy aging. We estimate that AK-OTOF has a potential addressable population of up to approximately 7,000 individuals, which is a subset of the total population of individuals with hearing loss due to mutations in the otoferlin gene, or OTOF, in the United States and European Union. Vestibular schwannoma, an inner ear condition of complex etiology, is among the most common type of intracranial tumor and affects approximately 200,000 individuals in the United States and Europe. In the United States, over 3,000 new vestibular schwannoma cases are diagnosed each year. Recent advances in genetic medicine have created the possibility of addressing the root cause of conditions that have a genetic basis. Serious conditions that previously had no pharmacologic treatments and, in some cases, insufficient non-pharmacologic interventions now have the potential to be addressed with one-time gene therapy administrations, including potential gene editing therapies, that can restore critical function to the eye, the spinal cord, the brain, and other organs. Despite these advances, we believe genetic medicine development for hearing loss and other inner ear conditions has been hindered by the unique anatomical delivery challenges of the inner ear. To overcome these challenges, our team has combined a proprietary vector library of synthetic AAVs that recreates the evolutionary lineage of current naturally occurring viruses, known as ancestral AAV, or AAVAnc, and a novel delivery approach that leverages minimally-invasive surgical techniques familiar to otologic surgeons. Our delivery approach is designed to allow for safe and effective delivery of product candidates and distribution of product candidates across the full length of the cochlea. The surgical approach is routine in standard otologic practice and the device is designed to deliver product candidates in a fixed volume at a controlled flow rate. Our proprietary vector library and delivery approach allow us to utilize AAV-enabled multimodal capabilities, including viral vector delivery to the target cell population where the full-length transgene is split into two vectors, known as a dual vector method. 
Our focused candidate selection criteria allow us to identify promising targets covering a range of inner ear cell types, including sensory hair cells and non-sensory supporting cells, to treat a broad range of inner ear conditions. We seek programs that have clinically well-established, objective, and quantifiable endpoints that can be incorporated in translatable nonclinical models during development, which we believe may provide drug development advantages, including the potential for more rapid clinical development. Additionally, given the epidemiology and severity of the conditions we are initially targeting, available regulatory pathways such as orphan drug designation and expedited pathways for serious conditions may provide the potential for more rapid regulatory approval. Our clinical development plan for AK-OTOF includes measurement of the auditory brainstem response, or ABR, an objective, clinically accepted endpoint, which we believe provides both clinical and regulatory advantages.

We have generated promising nonclinical data for our lead product candidate, AK-OTOF, a gene therapy for the treatment of hearing loss due to mutations in the OTOF gene. The OTOF gene encodes otoferlin, a protein that enables the inner hair cells of the cochlea, or the organ in the inner ear responsible for hearing, to release neurotransmitter vesicles in response to stimulation by sound to activate auditory neurons. The auditory neurons then carry electrically encoded acoustic information to the brain, which allows us to hear. We aim to restore otoferlin expression through targeted delivery of a proprietary AAVAnc capsid, known as AAVAnc80, containing the OTOF gene to individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss. We have selected AAVAnc80 from the larger AAVAnc vector library based on its high observed transduction efficiency in inner hair cells. Affected individuals are typically born with Severe-to-Profound hearing loss, which is confirmed through ABR testing, a commonly used measure of hearing loss. Based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we are designing our Phase 1/2 trial to include ABR as an efficacy endpoint. We believe that this will enable us to quickly determine a clinical response and potentially result in rapid advancement towards a pivotal trial. There are no pharmacologic therapies currently approved for the treatment or management of OTOF-mediated hearing loss, or any other form of sensorineural hearing loss. We believe our product candidate has the potential to restore physiologic hearing and provide long-lasting benefits to these individuals and their families. We are targeting submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AK-OTOF for the treatment of OTOF-mediated hearing loss to FDA in the first half of 2022. 
In addition to pursuing opportunities that require transduction of target cell populations to express intracellular genes of interest, we have also identified inner ear conditions that can potentially be treated with secreted proteins. AK-antiVEGF is our product candidate for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma, benign tumors that form in the cells around the vestibulocochlear nerve within the internal auditory canal. We believe an AAVAnc80 vector encoding a secreted anti-VEGF protein, delivered to the inner ear in the same manner as other programs in our pipeline, has the potential to stabilize tumor size and preserve hearing, while potentially avoiding the systemic side effects of high dose intravenous VEGF inhibitor infusion and potentially removing or reducing the need for surgical tumor resection and/or radiation. We completed a pre-IND meeting with FDA in October 2020. We plan to submit an IND for AK-antiVEGF in 2022. 
Our diversified portfolio of product and research candidates has been selected to leverage our platform across multiple inner ear conditions, starting with those resulting from mutations in a single gene, or monogenic forms of hearing loss, such as OTOF-mediated hearing loss, and building toward clinical development of genetic medicines for the most common forms of hearing loss, such as age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. In addition to our AK-OTOF and AK-antiVEGF programs, our pipeline product and research candidates address a range of inner ear cells and leverage different modalities. These programs include AK-CLRN1 for Usher Type 3A, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by progressive loss of both hearing and vision, and a program targeting gap junction protein beta 2 gene, or GJB2, for a common form of monogenic hearing loss.
To support the research and development of novel genetic medicines for disabling hearing loss, we initiated efforts to better understand the genetic causes and natural history of multiple forms of sensorineural hearing loss. We launched the ResonateTM program, which provides access to genetic testing for eligible individuals with auditory neuropathy at no cost to participants, their insurance providers, or their healthcare providers. Today, few individuals with hearing loss receive a genetic diagnosis and a key barrier is the availability and accessibility of genetic testing. In 2020, we initiated a natural history study to support development of AK-OTOF. The study will, amongst other objectives, provide additional information on the natural course of OTOF-mediated hearing loss and better define the potentially addressable patient population. 
We believe that our focus on developing internal manufacturing capabilities provides a competitive advantage. In 2020, we completed development of internal infrastructure, including acquisition and installation of equipment as well as successful completion of commissioning runs, necessary to manufacture vectors for good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies. We are establishing current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, capabilities that we believe will enable the manufacture of gene therapy vectors to support activities through Phase 1/2 clinical trials for our product candidates. We have also partnered with third-party manufacturers for production of IND-enabling nonclinical and cGMP material for our product candidates. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to further optimize our manufacturing capabilities to cost-effectively produce high-quality AAV vectors. We believe that our 

8



manufacturing processes, methods, expertise, facilities, and scale will give us a significant advantage in the development and ultimately commercialization of our AAV product candidates. 
We have assembled a world-class team with expertise in auditory anatomy and physiology, otopathology, human genetics, inner ear drug delivery, gene therapy and rare disease drug development, and commercialization. Our strong relationships with various stakeholders in the hearing health ecosystem will support our product development and our potential for future commercial success. Our relationships with leading academic researchers allow for the investigation of a wide range of inner ear gene targets and generation of initial in vivo proof of concept data across many indications and modalities that would not be possible using internal resources only. 
We believe that our promising nonclinical data, scientific expertise, product development strategy, planned manufacturing capabilities, and robust intellectual property portfolio position us as a leader in the development of precision genetic medicines for inner ear conditions.

Our Focus—Otology
Hearing Loss Overview
Hearing loss is one of the world’s largest unmet medical needs. Approximately 466 million people around the world, including 34 million children, live with disabling hearing loss. We estimate that AK-OTOF has a potential addressable population of up to approximately 7,000 individuals, which is a subset of the total population of individuals with hearing loss due to mutations in the OTOF gene in the United States and European Union. Vestibular schwannoma, an inner ear condition of complex etiology that AK-antiVEGF aims to address, is among the most common type of intracranial tumor and affects approximately 200,000 individuals in the United States and Europe. In the United States, 

9



over 3,000 new vestibular schwannoma cases are diagnosed each year. Vestibular schwannomas may result in a variety of symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, headaches, and impaired balance.
A growing body of evidence suggests hearing loss can have a significant impact on cognitive development, psychiatric health, and healthy aging. A prevalence-based cost analysis by researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the World Health Organization estimate the overall global economic costs of hearing loss in 2019 alone to be more than $981 billion, a figure that includes direct medical costs as well as indirect cost to families and society. In the United States, the direct cost to the healthcare system due to hearing loss is up to $12.8 billion annually, and this number fails to capture the considerable indirect societal costs. Early intervention has the potential to significantly improve the lives of affected individuals and their families as well as to reduce the significant economic impact of hearing loss.
Hearing loss can occur from the interference or blockage of sound transmission in the ear canal or middle ear, referred to as conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss can also occur as a result of dysfunction of the cochlea or auditory nerve, which is referred to as sensorineural hearing loss and includes many forms of genetic hearing loss, age related hearing loss, and noise related hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is the most prevalent form of hearing loss across all age groups. Our initial goal is to restore, improve, and preserve hearing for those with genetic forms of sensorineural hearing loss by targeting a known condition-causing gene or pathway. 
Congenital hearing loss is hearing loss at birth, and it is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in children. It is estimated that 60% to 80% of congenital hearing loss in the United States and Europe is sensorineural hearing loss due to genetic causes, which suggests that over 8,000 children are born with genetic forms of sensorineural hearing loss every year in these regions. Approximately 75% of these genetic hearing loss cases are nonsyndromic, meaning hearing loss that is not associated with other signs or other symptoms of medical importance. The remaining individuals with genetic forms of hearing loss have syndromic hearing loss, which means that in addition to hearing loss the individual has other symptoms of medical importance. More than 400 syndromes that include hearing loss have been identified, including Usher’s Syndrome, the most common type of autosomal recessive syndromic hearing loss, which typically also results in disabling vision loss. There are approximately 30 genes associated with autosomal recessive syndromic hearing loss and 10 genes associated with autosomal dominant syndromic hearing loss.
How We Hear

Hearing is the physiologic process by which environmental sounds are converted to a stream of neurologic signals that are processed by the brain. The ear consists of the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear, which includes the cochlea. Sound enters the ear through the external auditory canal of the outer ear, where it vibrates the tympanic membrane, or the ear drum. These sound vibrations are then relayed through the middle ear by a chain of three small bones called ossicles. The last of these bones, called the stapes, articulates with the cochlea at the oval window and passes sound energy into the cochlea. There are two openings from the middle ear into the inner ear, the round window membrane, or RWM, and the oval window. The cochlea contains a long, coiled, ribbon-like epithelial membrane that is suspended between two cochlear fluid compartments (shown in the bottom left image). Sensory cells called hair cells, arranged in a highly ordered fashion, sense the movement of fluid and convert the fluid waves into nerve impulses that are sent along the auditory nerve to the brain. As shown in the image on the right below, the cochlea contains a single row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells, along with a variety of non-sensory supporting cells, such as Pillar cells, Hensen’s cells, inner border cells, and Claudius cells. Neurotransmitter is released at the base of inner hair cells in response to sound, and results in activation of spiral ganglion cells and transmission of acoustic information to the brain.

10



How We Hear
The mechanical, biochemical, and molecular properties of the hair cells vary systematically along the length of the coiled membrane of the cochlea such that it is more responsive to high frequency sounds at the base and to low frequency sounds at the apex.
The human cochlea takes shape early in fetal development and is normally fully functional before birth. The cells that make up the cochlea do not divide post-development, and, as a result, the size of the cochlea (approximately 9mm by 5mm) remains unchanged from birth through adulthood.
The intricate interplay of inner ear structures required for hearing can be disrupted by changes in the DNA that encodes essential proteins or that regulates their function. Millions of people worldwide have disabling hearing loss as a result of genetic mutations affecting any one of over 150 genes linked to cochlear dysfunction. There are more than 6,000 known variants across these genes that can result in cochlear pathology and hearing loss. Depending on the genes involved, various subpopulations of cells in the cochlea can be affected.
Diagnosing Hearing Loss
A diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss depends on the demonstration of reduced hearing sensitivity, or acuity, by auditory testing. Typically, sounds are played to an individual through headphones at different loudness levels and different frequencies. The frequency, or pitch, of tones at which hearing loss is assessed is measured in hertz, or Hz, and can be designated as:

● | Low, up to 500 Hz;
--+-------------------


● | Middle, 501 to 2000 Hz;
--+------------------------


● | High, 2001 to 8000 Hz; or
--+--------------------------


● | Ultrahigh, greater than 8000 Hz.
--+---------------------------------

The audiometric threshold is the quietest level at which the individual responds at each frequency. For individuals who are unable to respond to sound by raising their hand or speaking, ABR testing can be used to determine the audiometric threshold by indicating whether the inner ear and the brain pathways respond to sounds; in other words, ABR testing can determine the audiometric threshold, and assess auditory function, without the need for a voluntary subject response. ABR is measured with electrodes that attach to the skin near the ear, and the electrodes are connected 

11



to a computer that records brain wave activity in response to sounds transmitted through earphones. In ABR testing, the audiometric threshold is the quietest level that can produce a brain wave.
Hearing loss is measured in decibels, or dB, relative to normal hearing, with 0 dB hearing loss serving as the normative reference. Hearing acuity for children is typically classified as normal if audiometric thresholds are 25 dB hearing loss or less. Severity of hearing loss is typically graded as follows:

● | Mild: 26 to 40 dB hearing loss
--+-------------------------------


● | Moderate: 41 to 55 dB hearing loss
--+-----------------------------------


● | Moderately Severe: 56 to 70 dB hearing loss, sometimes grouped with Moderate
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Severe: 71 to 90 dB hearing loss
--+---------------------------------


● | Profound: greater than 90 dB hearing loss
--+------------------------------------------

These hearing loss classification ranges are depicted in the audiogram below, which includes examples of speech and environmental sounds and shows an individual with Severe-to-Profound hearing loss that is bilateral, or appearing in both ears. The circles and Xs represent hearing thresholds at given sound frequencies in the right and left ears, respectively. An individual with this audiogram would be unable to hear sounds at lower dB levels above the circles and Xs.

12



​
Children with Severe-to-Profound hearing loss cannot perceive typical speech sounds, depicted in the darker shaded area of the figure above and sometimes referred to as the speech banana, and are unlikely to develop verbal language. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes congenital hearing loss as a potential neurodevelopmental emergency that should be identified as early as possible in order to enable early intervention. Experience with pediatric cochlear implants, or CIs, has demonstrated that a child has a better chance to develop normal speech and language the earlier a child receives the implant. There appears to be a window of time during the development of the auditory cortex where the absence of auditory input results in failure to develop the synaptic and neuronal networks necessary for verbal language. As a result, with federal government support, every state in the United States has established an Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program.
Today, 97% of newborns in the United States have their hearing screened, and most individuals with Severe-to-Profound congenital hearing loss in the United States are identified shortly after birth. Hospitals typically use either ABR or otoacoustic emission, or OAE, testing to identify hearing loss in newborns. ABR testing reflects how the cochlea, auditory nerve, and auditory pathways in the brain are working, a measure of auditory function. OAE testing reflects whether outer hair cells in the cochlea respond to sound, a measure of cochlear function. These cells respond to sound by vibrating, and each vibration produces a very low level sound that echoes back into the ear canal and can be measured with a microphone. In OAE testing, a small earphone containing speakers and a microphone is placed in the ear to deliver sounds into the ear and measure the sounds that come back. OAE testing is more sensitive to other middle 

13



ear problems than ABR, but does not detect problems in the auditory nerve or brain pathways. ABR testing, on the other hand, provides direct evidence of an auditory signal that is transmitted from the cochlea to the brain. As a result, though OAE testing could be an important eligibility determinant for future interventional trials or treatment options because it can be used to evaluate the presence and viability of hair cells, ABR testing is a more relevant measure of clinical efficacy and is routinely relied upon in clinical practice to determine whether sound is being encoded by and transmitted through the cochlea and auditory nerve to the brain.
Current Treatment Options
Children and adults with Severe-to-Profound sensorineural hearing loss typically do not benefit from hearing aids. Currently, the only option for some forms of Severe-to-Profound sensorineural hearing loss is receiving a CI, a surgically implanted device. However, only approximately 50% of deaf children in the United States receive a CI even though more than 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents. Among adults who have developed Severe-to-Profound hearing loss in the United States, fewer than 10% receive a CI.
Receiving a CI requires a surgical procedure that takes approximately two to four hours and typically involves drilling through the mastoid bone and placement of a permanent electrode in the cochlea. The damage inherently sustained by the sensory epithelium in this procedure makes the CI likely incompatible with future restorative biologic therapies involving the cochlear sensory cells. Although CIs have improved the outcomes of many congenitally deaf children, the auditory signal they transmit is impoverished compared to that provided by physiologic hearing and a CI does not restore normal hearing. Recipients of CIs often report difficulty understanding speech in many real-world environments, even with low levels of background noise, and complex multiple-speaking conversations typical of many group settings are often challenging. The normal, physiologic ear's fine frequency discrimination and sensitivity to a wide, dynamic range of sound intensities allows for extraction of emotional content from speech, environmental sounds, and music. In contrast, the CI is not able to transmit this complex auditory content.
In addition, although the cochlea itself does not increase in size from birth through adulthood, the surrounding skull changes considerably over time. As a result, children who receive an implant at a young age can experience negative consequences from anatomical movement and may require surgical revision to correct poor outcomes due to CI migration. Furthermore, extensive speech-language therapy following implantation is required for children to develop verbal language. The necessity of this therapy, combined with the frequent follow-ups required for device maintenance, contribute to poorer outcomes in children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, CIs can fail, resulting in revision surgeries or reimplantation in up to 10% of cases, with a median time to device failure of 60 months. 
Some companies are studying investigational product candidates in clinical trials, such as corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, that are administered to the middle ear through the ear drum, or intratympanically. Intratympanic administration consists of injecting drug in liquid or gel form through the ear drum and relies on passive diffusion of the drug from the middle ear into the inner ear through the RWM. Many drugs cannot readily cross these barriers and are therefore not candidates for intratympanic delivery. In general, the larger a molecule, the less amenable it is to diffusion across biological barriers. AAV vectors are more than 10,000-fold larger than the small molecules currently being tested using intratympanic administration. Even the small molecules that can diffuse across these barriers do so in a manner that is expected to be highly variable between individuals, and once they enter the inner ear fluid space, poor diffusion throughout the length of the cochlea is anticipated. This would result in large concentration gradients from the base of the cochlear spiral, where the molecules enter the inner ear, toward the apex; very little drug would reach even the middle frequency regions of the cochlea that are important for functional hearing. We believe that for AAV vectors to achieve consistent distribution throughout the full length of the cochlear sensory epithelium, a novel delivery approach is required.
Advantages and Potential for Genetic Medicine
Recent advances in genetic medicine have created the possibility of addressing the root cause of conditions that have a genetic basis. Serious conditions that previously had no pharmacologic treatments and, in some cases, insufficient 

14



non-pharmacologic treatments can now potentially be addressed with one-time gene therapy administrations, including potential gene editing therapies, that can restore critical function to the eye, the spinal cord, the brain, and other organs. 
We believe the anatomy and biology of the inner ear make it uniquely suited for the delivery of one-time gene modifying therapeutics. Genetic medicine using AAV vectors is a promising therapeutic approach for inner ear conditions for several reasons:

● | the inner ear, which contains the auditory sensory epithelium, has reduced immune surveillance, similar to that in the central nervous system;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the anatomy of the ear is fully developed at birth, making it an attractive target for early surgical delivery of therapies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sensory cells within the inner ear are non-dividing, allowing for the possibility of durable expression following a single administration of AAV;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the aggregate clinical experience with AAV delivery in both adults and children through multiple routes of administration has established AAV as an accepted delivery vehicle;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lower doses of vector are required given the size of the ear and the small number of target cells; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with approximately 75 autosomal recessive nonsyndromic genes that mediate hearing loss, there are a significant number of potential therapeutic targets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite these advantages, AAV genetic medicine development for hearing loss conditions has been hindered by the unique anatomical delivery challenges of the inner ear. Because the sensory epithelium of the inner ear is suspended between two fixed-volume fluid chambers and encased in bone, it has proven challenging to achieve sufficient drug distribution without damaging sensory cells. Multiple studies have demonstrated that infusion of fluid into a closed cochlear system can produce threshold shifts, or decreases in hearing sensitivity, that are dependent on flow rate and infusion time. Others have shown that diffusion-based delivery, from the middle ear into and through the inner ear fluids, is highly variable and too slow relative to absorption by surrounding tissue to result in even distribution along the sensory epithelium. These challenges informed our strategy of developing a novel inner ear delivery approach designed to consistently achieve even distribution throughout the cochlea.
By building upon recent advances in genetic medicine and combining them with the appropriate delivery approach, we believe we can effectively address the underlying cause of many different forms of inner ear dysfunction and hearing loss with inner ear-directed therapies that are single-administration and carry the potential to restore, improve, and preserve high-acuity physiologic hearing for individuals who live with disabling hearing loss worldwide.
Our Platform
Our precision genetic medicine platform enables delivery of genetic medicines to the inner ear utilizing a proprietary library of approximately 38,000 novel AAVAnc capsids, for which we have an exclusive license as to the ear, and a novel delivery approach that leverages a minimally invasive and routine surgical approach. We believe these AAVAnc vectors have superior transduction of cochlear cells compared to other AAV serotypes and allow for a multimodal therapeutic approach. For example, AAVAnc80 enables us to target a larger landscape of inner ear conditions using different vector-mediated modalities. We have established scalable manufacturing processes and expertise, and plan to internalize these capabilities, which we view as a competitive advantage because it may give us significant control over process development timelines, costs, and intellectual property. We believe our platform's attributes, along with our disciplined product and research candidate selection criteria, will allow us to develop genetic medicines for a wide range of inner ear conditions.

15



Our Delivery Approach
As part of our precision genetic medicine platform, we are developing a delivery device designed to allow for the safe and effective delivery of our product candidates, including AK-OTOF and AK-antiVEGF into the cochlea. Intracochlear delivery poses a unique set of challenges. The cochlea is in the base of the skull, and access requires a surgical approach. The cochlea in humans and non-human primates is a relatively closed space, and infusing fluid into the cochlea could result in deleterious elevations in pressure and/or efflux of the infusate through the site of administration. Product candidate delivered to one part of the cochlea must spread by diffusion to other parts, and this results in significant variation in product candidate concentration throughout the cochlea. The challenge is to deliver a uniform concentration of product candidate along the length of the cochlea without elevating cochlear pressure. Our novel delivery approach utilizes a minimally invasive, well-accepted surgical technique for accessing the middle ear through the ear canal. As is performed in standard otologic practice when performing a stapedotomy, we plan to open one of the physical barriers between the middle and inner ear at the oval window. We intend to use our delivery device to deliver product candidates, at a controlled flow rate and in a fixed volume, through the RWM, as depicted in the image on the left below. The opening at the oval window, a fenestration of the stapes footplate, serves as a vent to prevent pressure build-up and facilitate the flow of product candidate throughout the entire length of the cochlea. This approach is designed to allow our product candidates to be distributed across the full length of the cochlea and therefore access cells at the base, middle, and apex of the cochlea. In nonclinical studies involving non-human primates, our team’s pioneering inner ear delivery work has allowed us to determine flow rate and volume parameters that show distribution across the entire length of the primate cochlea without damaging therapeutically relevant cell types.

The mechanical, biochemical, and molecular properties of the hair cells vary along the length of the coiled membrane of the cochlea such that it is more responsive to high frequency sounds at the base and low frequency sounds at the apex, as indicated in the image above on the right, in which the normally coiled membrane of the cochlea has been elongated, or uncoiled, to illustrate the delivery of our product candidates through the length of the cochlea. 
Our delivery device was specifically designed to facilitate intracochlear administration using a minimally invasive surgical approach. Due to the size and compartmentalization of the inner ear, and the observed high transduction efficiency of AAVAnc80, we anticipate our product candidates, including AK-OTOF and AK-antiVEGF, will be administered in a low volume and a low dose to the inner ear using the device and approach described above. Procedures to access the inner ear up to the point of product candidate delivery are routinely performed by surgeons experienced in performing ear surgery, such as otolaryngologists and neurotologists, and we anticipate our approach will promote consistency and ease of use across surgeons.
Our Vector Technology
We have access to a library of approximately 38,000 AAVAncs for the potential treatment of inner ear, balance, and hearing loss conditions through our exclusive licenses. As we build out our product candidate pipeline, this AAVAnc vector library presents flexibility with respect to transgene delivery and AAV-enabled modality. We are screening the AAVAnc library for improved AAV properties such as tropism, or the ability to target distinct types of 

16



cells, transduction efficiency, and production efficiency. We also evaluate capsid technology beyond the AAVAnc library to select the optimal capsid for each of our future programs.
We have selected the AAVAnc80 capsid for much of our initial work based on its observed high transduction efficiency for many important target cells in the cochlea. AAVAnc80 is a rationally designed AAV capsid developed by Dr. Luk Vandenberghe, an Akouos founder, Director of the Grossbeck Gene Therapy Center, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, and Associate Member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Harnessing the power of computational and predictive biology, the AAVAnc80 sequence was inferred by ancestral sequence reconstruction and is the predicted ancestor of the widely studied AAV serotypes 1, 2, 8, and 9. The AAVAnc80 capsid variant has a distinctive composition with a divergent external surface particle distribution that yields a stable and functional AAV variant. 
Multiple independent investigations have shown high inner hair cell transduction efficiency of AAVAnc80 relative to other AAV serotypes in mice of various ages, and this transduction efficiency has also been observed in adult and juvenile non-human primates, supporting the translatability of the AAVAnc80 vector across models. We have conducted nonclinical studies across three different non-human primate models. These studies used green fluorescent protein, or GFP, as a reporter gene delivered by AAVAnc80 to demonstrate that AAVAnc80 can efficiently transduce not just inner hair cells, but multiple target cell populations throughout the cochlea in the primate inner ear. Shown in red in the bottom left corner of the figure below, Myo7a, a hair cell marker, is used to make inner and outer hair cells visible. As illustrated below, in this study, non-human primates receiving AAVAnc80-GFP showed extensive transduction of inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and various non-sensory supporting cells, including Hensen’s cells, Pillar cells, inner border cells, and satellite glial cells in the spiral ganglion.

Preliminary data from two additional nonclinical studies, in two different non-human primate models, indicate that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAVAnc80, even at relatively high levels in serum, did not inhibit inner hair cell and other cochlear cell transduction when an AAVAnc80 vector was delivered through an intracochlear route of administration.
In another non-human primate study, we observed that inner hair cell transduction, when measured at three weeks following administration of an AAVAnc80 vector encoding GFP, was at least 75% at a modest dose of 6E10 vector genomes, or vg, per cochlea or above, as shown in the image below. In this image, each symbol denotes an individual non-human primate (six total), and the blue and green symbols show animals receiving vector at or above this modest dose level, while the pink symbols show less complete transduction across the cochlea, specifically an apex to base gradient, in animals that received a lower dose of vector.

Administration of an AAVAnc80 Vector Encoding GFP
We have observed that AAVAnc80 tropism and transduction efficiency are consistent across multiple animal models, from rodents to multiple non-human primate species. This consistency helps support dose selection across species and supports our view that AAVAnc80 is well suited to clinical development. In addition, the ability to transduce many different cell types opens a unique opportunity to address a broad range of inner ear conditions, as illustrated below. As shown in the diagram below, different genes are associated with the different cell types in the ear, including inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and supporting cells, and in some cases, genes are expressed in more than one type of cell.

Access to Multiple Cell Types Opens Large Target Landscape
The high observed transduction efficiency of AAVAnc80, coupled with the compartmentalization of the inner ear, paves the way for us to utilize a dual vector approach to deliver larger transgenes to this target area. In the dual vector approach, two vectors, each of which contains a portion of the full-length transgene, are delivered to a target cell population. A target cell needs to receive a copy of both vectors, one containing the 5’ fragment of the transgene and the other containing the 3’ fragment of the transgene. After both vectors enter a target cell, the two transgene components can recombine to enable expression of full-length protein. In a non-human primate study, we tested the dual vector approach using a GFP transgene that is divided and packaged into two separate AAVAnc80 vectors. Each vector alone would not result in GFP expression, but delivery of both vectors together resulted in full-length GFP expression. As shown in the image below, of four non-human primates that received dual AAVAnc80 vectors encoding GFP, we observed more than 80% transduction of inner hair cells throughout the entire cochlea in three of the animals at three weeks following administration.
The reconstitution of a complete transgene using dual AAVAnc80 vectors was accomplished in non-human primate inner hair cells at doses equivalent to those we believe would be well tolerated in humans.

We believe the degree of dual vector transduction efficiency that we have observed in our nonclinical studies creates the potential for the treatment of additional hearing loss conditions with a genetic basis beyond OTOF-mediated hearing loss.
Our Multimodal Capabilities
While our lead product program, AK-OTOF, involves dual AAVAnc80 transgene delivery, we are also using our precision genetic medicine platform to build a product candidate pipeline with the potential to address a broad landscape of monogenic and inner ear conditions of complex etiology using vector-mediated gene transfer, gene knockdown, gene editing, and the delivery of transgenes that express therapeutic proteins such as antibodies using viral vectors, which we refer to as vector-mediated therapeutic protein expression. The figure and text below illustrate how we believe our platform could address the landscape of monogenic and inner ear conditions of complex etiology using various AAV-enabled modalities.

● | Gene Transfer for Autosomal Recessive Inner Ear Conditions. There are approximately 75 genes implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, many of which are potentially addressable using AAV gene therapy. Gene transfer is intended to restore the function of a gene that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels, or expressed in a form that is dysfunctional. Our pipeline includes product candidates deploying an AAVAnc80 gene transfer approach targeting hair cells, to restore expression of the OTOF or CLRN1 genes, and targeting non-sensory supporting cells, to restore expression of the GJB2 gene.

● | Gene Knockdown or Gene Editing for Autosomal Dominant Inner Ear Conditions. There are at least 48 genes associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. For many of these, there is an opportunity to use vector-mediated RNA interference or vector-mediated genome editing to knockdown or edit mutated genes, respectively. For example, one of our founders, Dr. Richard Smith at the University of Iowa, has published data demonstrating that vector-mediated RNA interference improved hearing in an animal model of progressive hearing loss due to an autosomal dominant mutation in the TMC1 gene. Other investigators at Harvard Medical School recently published data in Nature Medicine showing that AAVAnc80-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the TMC1 gene improved hearing to wild-type levels in a representative animal model. We believe similar strategies could be deployed against many other genes with toxic gain-of-function or dominant negative mechanisms that result in hearing loss, such as COCH, KCNQ4, GSDME, WFS, ACTG1, TECTA, MYO7A, EYA4, IFNLR1, POU4F3, COL11A2, TMC1, MYO6, CEACAM16, GJB2, SIX1, MYH9, REST, and SLC17A8.

● | Vector-mediated Therapeutic Protein Expression for Prevalent Inner Ear Conditions of Complex Etiology. There are multiple AAV gene therapies in development that aim to provide long-term antibody or other therapeutic protein delivery to the central nervous system following a one-time administration. For example, other groups are developing AAV-based gene therapies to deliver antibodies to the brain for the treatment of various neurodegenerative conditions. Similar to the central nervous system, the inner ear has the potential to benefit from this approach, and we believe some of the most common hearing loss conditions could be treated using vector-mediated therapeutic protein expression. Our first such product candidate, AK-antiVEGF, targets vestibular schwannoma, a benign tumor that forms in the cells around the vestibulocochlear nerve within the internal auditory canal. Some of our early stage discovery efforts are focused on exploring the ability of vector-mediated therapeutic protein expression to treat forms of age-related and noise-induced hearing loss.

Our Rigorous Process for Selecting Product Candidates
Over 150 genes have been linked to monogenic forms of hearing loss. While many of these genes are expressed in the hair cells, some of the most common monogenic forms of hearing loss result from mutations in genes expressed in non-sensory supporting cells within the inner ear. We believe we can leverage our precision genetic medicine platform to deliver a range of transgenes to multiple cell types in the inner ear. We apply the following selection criteria in identifying opportunities to pursue:

● | Consistency with core focus. Our focus on AAV genetic medicine, the therapeutic area of otology, and local administration directly to the inner ear allows us to employ a disciplined and data-driven approach to select and expand our product candidate pipeline. We believe our selection approach will enable the efficient expansion of our product candidate pipeline, which will support our continued leadership in the field and maximize our impact on the broader hearing loss population.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targets that are well-suited for genetic medicine and have a clearly defined mechanism with supporting data from human genetics. We believe suitable targets for inner ear gene therapy must be associated with a cell population that we can consistently and efficiently access with an AAV vector, as demonstrated in non-human primates, and for which long-term transgene expression following a single administration is desirable. We believe our deep understanding of otology and human genetics allows us to effectively select such targets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High unmet need and large addressable patient population. We plan to pursue targets that are well defined and serve a population with high unmet need. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for sensorineural hearing loss. There are over 6,000 new cases of monogenic, congenital hearing loss per year in the United States alone. We are dedicated to developing genetic medicines that have the potential to restore, improve, and preserve high-acuity physiologic hearing in individuals living with different types of hearing loss with various, well-characterized underlying causes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promising in vivo data. We collaborate broadly with the scientific community in an effort to accelerate proof of concept studies across a wide range of hearing loss conditions in relevant animal models. When possible, we leverage existing nonclinical or clinical data generated by others that support modulation of a gene target or disease pathway that can have a meaningful impact on a given condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clear endpoints with potential for rapid clinical read-out. We seek programs that have clinically well-established, objective, and quantifiable endpoints that can be incorporated in translatable nonclinical models during development. For example, in our lead AK-OTOF program, we plan to use ABR testing as an efficacy endpoint during clinical development. There is extensive clinical experience with ABR testing across all age groups in humans, and it is routinely used in newborn hearing screening programs. In addition, we have used ABR testing in several animal models.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to utilize learnings to mitigate development risk. We plan to leverage the learnings of the AK-OTOF, AK-antiVEGF, and subsequent programs to select additional product candidates and thereby increase the efficiency and likelihood of success with which subsequent product candidates are developed.

Our Programs
Our diversified portfolio of product and research candidates has been selected to leverage our capabilities across multiple inner ear conditions. We are targeting conditions resulting from genetic mutations in a single gene, or monogenic forms of hearing loss, in hair cells and supporting cells of the inner ear. Additionally, we are targeting other inner ear conditions that may be amenable to treatment approaches that rely on secreted proteins. Our pipeline programs have been selected to leverage the learnings of our lead program to increase the efficiency and the likelihood of success with which subsequent product candidates are developed.

Our Lead Product Candidate: AK-OTOF
Using our precision genetic medicine platform, we are developing our lead product candidate, AK-OTOF, a gene therapy intended for the treatment of individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss. AK-OTOF is designed to treat the underlying cause of OTOF-mediated hearing loss through delivery of a transgene using a dual vector technology that results in expression of normal, functional otoferlin protein in the affected cells, namely inner hair cells, in the cochlea. We believe that AK-OTOF has the potential to meaningfully improve overall hearing function in individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss. We are targeting an IND submission, for AK-OTOF for the treatment of OTOF-mediated hearing loss, to FDA in the first half of 2022.
Overview of the Condition
The OTOF gene encodes otoferlin, a protein that enables the sensory cells of the ear to release neurotransmitter vesicles in response to stimulation by sound to activate auditory neurons. The auditory neurons then carry electrically encoded acoustic information to the brain that allows us to hear. Most individuals with OTOF mutations have congenital, Severe-to-Profound sensorineural hearing loss and no or highly abnormal ABR. 
The physiologic defect resulting from OTOF mutations is localized, and only synaptic transmission between the hair cell and the auditory nerve is impaired. In young individuals, the rest of the cochlea appears to be functional as determined by OAE testing, suggesting that restoration of otoferlin has the potential to restore hearing. The image below illustrates the localization of otoferlin within the inner hair cells of the cochlea. Otoferlin is required for the priming and fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles at the junction of the inner hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons, which carry acoustic information to the brain.


23



A diagnosis of OTOF-mediated hearing loss is typically indicated by clinical findings, including results of ABR and OAE testing, and is later confirmed by genetic testing. The clinical descriptors associated with an individual with OTOF-mediated hearing loss, auditory neuropathy being one such example, may vary depending on the treatment center, what specific tests have been performed, whether these tests were performed before or after loss of OAE, and physician training and preference. 
Mutations in the OTOF gene are a major cause of genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss, affecting an estimated 200,000 individuals worldwide. Based on published natural history data, and the subset of individuals we believe could obtain the greatest benefit from AK-OTOF, we estimate a potential addressable population with OTOF-mediated hearing loss of up to approximately 7,000 individuals in the United States and European Union. 
There are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies to address OTOF-mediated hearing loss. In the absence of an approved pharmacologic therapy, the only options consist of hearing aids or CIs. Hearing aids do not benefit children with Profound hearing loss from birth, as in the case for most individuals with congenital OTOF-mediated hearing loss. Although CIs have been shown to be effective for children with monogenic forms of hearing loss, CIs have significant drawbacks and are generally not an optimal solution. We believe that a genetic medicine, delivered as a one-time therapy without the need for extensive follow-up care and maintenance, that addresses the underlying cause of genetic forms of sensorineural hearing loss and has the ability to restore physiologic hearing, could be impactful in these patient populations while being less invasive and potentially more effective.
Our Solution
AK-OTOF is designed to treat individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss by delivering the normal OTOF gene in order to produce normal, functional otoferlin in affected inner hair cells. The presumed mechanism of action for AK-OTOF is the recovery of otoferlin protein function resulting in an increased signal from the affected inner hair cells to the auditory cortex in the brain. AK-OTOF uses AAVAnc80 as a delivery vehicle for the normal human OTOF gene. Because the length of the OTOF complementary DNA, or cDNA, exceeds the packaging capacity of an individual AAV vector, we are using a dual vector approach. In the case of AK-OTOF, one AAVAnc80 vector carries the 5’ fragment of the OTOF gene, and the other AAVAnc80 vector carries the 3’ fragment of the OTOF gene.
Pharmacology
In multiple nonclinical studies, it has been observed that the delivery of the OTOF gene into the affected inner hair cells of mice using AAV vectors, including AAVAnc80, restored auditory function. Mouse models of OTOF-mediated hearing loss exhibit the same characteristic phenotype as that observed in the human population, including absent ABR, which measures signals traveling to the brain, and present OAE, which measures the existence of outer hair cells. In addition, Otof knock-out mice are known to maintain surviving inner hair cells and outer hair cells after cochlear development is complete, which allows evaluation of the treatment potential at an age relevant to the human population. 
Two early proof of concept studies were performed using different mouse models of OTOF-mediated hearing loss. In the first of these two proof of concept studies, conducted at University of Goettingen, data indicated restoration of auditory function following dual vector administration of the OTOF gene using AAV6 vectors three to four weeks following administration, as measured by ABR in response to broadband clicks and tone bursts at different sound pressure levels, or SPLs. Additionally, by quantifying click-evoked ABR wave amplitudes and AAV transduction by immunolabeling, it was observed that higher full-length otoferlin inner hair cell transduction rates correlated with higher overall ABR wave amplitudes. 
The second proof of concept study was performed at the University of California, San Francisco in an Otof knock-out mouse model, denoted as Otof-/-. In this study, the mice received a dual vector administration of the OTOF gene using AAV2 quadY-F vectors at a dose of approximately 2.2E10 total vg per cochlea (1.3E10 vg of the 5’ vector and 9.0E9 vg of the 3’ vector) through the RWM at one of three different intervention times (10, 17, and 30 days post-natal). Recovery of auditory function was assessed at multiple times post-treatment. As shown in the graphic on the left below, ABR recordings in the mice four weeks after treatment demonstrated a substantial restoration of brainstem activity in response to click stimuli and tone-burst stimuli (at 8, 16, and 32 kHz) in treated mice. No restoration was 

24



observed in mice receiving 5’ OTOF vector alone or untreated Otof knock-out mice. As shown in the graphic on the right below, the ABR thresholds for click stimuli in the dual vector treated mice did not change significantly from those of wild-type mice when measured at either four or 30 weeks post-treatment, indicating a sustained effect of the treatment. 
Restoration of ABR Thresholds in Otof Knock-out
Mice Receiving a Dual AAV Vector Expressing OTOF
​
In this study, eight weeks after the treatment, otoferlin protein was detected in more than 60% of the inner hair cells of the mice treated with the dual vector, but not in other cell types of the cochlea, suggesting that a large cDNA can effectively be reconstituted in cochlear sensory cells upon the local delivery of two AAV vectors in vivo, with sustained, widespread production of the otoferlin protein in a large proportion of the target cells in the cochlea. 
The published data from these two separate labs represent preclinical proof of the concept that cochlear delivery of two AAV-OTOF vectors can enable production of the full-length otoferlin protein, resulting in sustained correction of hearing loss and supporting the rationale for our development of a dual AAV vector approach for the treatment of OTOF-mediated hearing loss. 
In a third nonclinical study in Otof knock-out mice conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Goettingen, the intracochlear delivery of a dual AAVAnc80 vector encoding human OTOF was assessed. The Otof knock-out mice were treated at post-natal day six or seven with two different doses: 5.1E9 total vg per cochlea (3.1E9 vg per cochlea 5’ vector and 2.0E9 vg per cochlea 3’ vector) and 1.1E9 total vg/cochlea (6.2E8 vg per cochlea 5’ vector and 3.9E8 vg per cochlea 3’ vector). Treated mice were measured at approximately one month, three months, seven months, and ten months post-treatment. As shown in the graphic below, treatment of these mice with AK-OTOF resulted in ABR click-evoked thresholds nearly comparable to wild-type mice. Treated mice showed significant click-evoked ABR recovery of 45 dB SPL of the treated ear and showed tone burst-evoked ABR responses of 60 to 80 dB SPL at 6 to 12 kHz, indicating hearing recovery in the apex region of the cochlea, at approximately one month through at least ten months post-treatment.

25



Intracochlear Delivery of AK-OTOF Resulted in Significant,
Long-term Hearing Recovery in Otof Knock-out Mice
We conducted an initial dose range finding study in Otof knock-out mice to determine the biologically active dose range of AK-OTOF. These data have informed the proposed dosing for our IND-enabling nonclinical studies and, in combination with other pharmacology and toxicology data, help support a proposed starting clinical dose in humans. AK-OTOF was administered to mice aged 21 to 25 days, at multiple doses ranging from 3.1E8 total vg per cochlea to 3.1E10 total vg per cochlea, through the RWM into the cochlea. While the human cochlea is fully mature at birth, the mouse cochlea continues to mature through day 20 and, as a result, we selected mice aged 21 to 25 days to approximate the developmental stage of the cochlea in a human newborn. 
The preliminary data from this dose-ranging study demonstrated recovery of ABR thresholds and robust hair cell survival four weeks post-administration in some of the dose groups. The most consistent and pronounced ABR threshold recovery was seen following delivery of AK-OTOF at doses of 3.1E9 and 9.9E9 vg per cochlea. Five of the six mice receiving these doses had at least one tone-burst frequency in which ABR thresholds were within the range of the wild-type, vehicle-treated mice. A representative example of ABR recovery from this nonclinical study is shown in the figure below. Here, we observed that AK-OTOF restored the ABR threshold in a treated mouse to the same level observed in a wild-type mouse receiving a vehicle control. Each panel in this image shows the ABR wave form in response to click stimuli at given intensity levels in dB SPL. An Otof knock-out mouse receiving a vehicle control had an ABR threshold of approximately 45 dB SPL, shown as a bold black line on the left panel of the figure below. An Otof knock-out mouse treated with vehicle control had no ABR, as can be seen by the absence of any peaks in the red lines in the middle panel. As shown in the bold aqua line on the right panel, when the Otof knock-out mouse was treated with AK-OTOF, we observed a recovery of ABR at the same threshold level of approximately 45 dB SPL as that of the wild-type mouse on the left.

A Single Dose of AK-OTOF Restored Auditory Function in Otof -/-Mice with Mature Cochleae
Safety

We performed a non-GLP, pilot toxicology study of AK-OTOF in non-human primates, as well as vectors containing either the individual 3’ or 5’ fragments of OTOF, delivered into the cochlea. The aim of this study was to assess both local and systemic effects of AK-OTOF and the individual component vectors in order to inform the design of IND-enabling studies with respect to time points, in-life assessments, and post-mortem assessments. The pilot study provided longer-term (six month) safety information, in addition to both acute (one month) and chronic (three month) safety information, individual vector safety data, and biodistribution and shedding data for the intracochlear route of administration. The animals received baseline and follow-on auditory or cochlear function tests, including bilateral ABR and OAE testing. Standard in-life toxicology assessments, such as daily clinical observations, body weight, body condition scoring, and clinical pathology, were also conducted at baseline and following study periods. AK-OTOF and the surgical administration procedure were generally well tolerated, and all animals in the study completed assessments through their scheduled necropsy date.
Based on input received in our September 2019 pre-IND meeting with FDA, we completed a GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys using AK-OTOF.
Dose Selection
The AK-OTOF doses evaluated in our GLP toxicology study, which encompass and exceed the equivalent doses planned for our proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial, were scaled based on relative cochlear volumes of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans. The vector concentrations were selected based on efficacy data from the Otof knock-out mouse dose range finding study. This dose translation scheme is consistent with dose scaling for other therapeutics administered into anatomical compartments where compartment volumes and concentration of a therapeutic are used to normalize between species. In our September 2019 pre-IND meeting, FDA agreed with our proposal to use cochlear volume for dose extrapolation from animals to humans.

27



Planned Clinical Development
We initiated a natural history study in individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss in 2020. For enrollment in this study, as well as for a planned prospective natural history study, participants need to have confirmed mutations in the OTOF gene and clinical presentation of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Data are collected from participants that undergo repeated physiologic and behavioral testing of the auditory system, such as OAE testing and ABR testing, as well as other standard assessments such as age-appropriate pure tone audiometry, behavioral audiometry, and auditory questionnaires. Retrospective data are collected, and, once enrolled, participants may be followed for up to five years. The objectives of these studies are to provide additional information on the natural course of OTOF-mediated hearing loss, better define the potentially addressable patient landscape for our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial, create inner ear genetic medicine-specific clinical centers of excellence, and familiarize potential centers and participants with participation in our clinical trials and the testing procedures within this patient population.
We intend to initiate a proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial for AK-OTOF for the treatment of individuals with OTOF-mediated hearing loss, subject to FDA acceptance of an IND. This trial will be conducted in two parts. The first part will be an adaptive dose escalation phase to assess the safety, tolerability, and bioactivity of escalating doses of AK-OTOF administered to trial participants through a single unilateral intracochlear injection. The second part will be a cohort expansion phase to assess both continued safety as well as effectiveness. We expect eligibility with respect to age for this Phase 1/2 clinical trial to be based on both published data and data from our natural history studies. Additionally, based on our pre-IND meeting with FDA in September 2019, we anticipate that our Phase 1/2 clinical trial may enroll children as young as one year old in the expansion phase. Outcome assessments will include objective and clinically relevant ABR testing and age-appropriate behavioral audiometry. 
Based on our discussions with representatives of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, and Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, in our pre-IND meeting, we intend to file the delivery device along with the investigational product in an IND application as a combination product. Prior to seeking a marketing application for AK-OTOF, or for another of our product candidates, with CBER, but following demonstration that the probable benefits of delivery of therapeutic agents to the cochlea outweigh the potential risks, we may pursue the de novo pathway for our delivery device with the CDRH. While technically a combination product given anticipated cross-labeling of the biologic to our specific delivery device, we may choose to submit separate applications for the constituent parts of a combination product.
In 2021, AK-OTOF was granted orphan drug designations by the FDA and the European Commission, and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA. These designations could accelerate our development of AK-OTOF.
Given the seriousness of the condition, and the potential sustained effect on cells or tissues, we also plan to seek regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation for AK-OTOF if preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address an unmet need for patients with OTOF-mediated hearing loss. 
For further information regarding potential regulatory pathways, see “Government Regulation.”
Product Candidate for Secreted Protein: AK-antiVEGF


In addition to pursuing opportunities that require transduction of target cell populations to express intracellular genes of interest, we have also identified inner ear conditions that can potentially be treated with secreted proteins. To address these opportunities, we intend to use an AAVAnc vector to transduce a range of cell types and enable these cells to secrete a protein with the potential to restore, improve, or preserve hearing and/or other functions of inner ear. The secreted protein can be one that is normally expressed in the ear, as in the case of a gene transfer approach for a monogenic indication, or it can be an exogenous therapeutic protein, as in the case of a vector-mediated therapeutic protein expression approach for an inner ear condition of complex etiology.
Our preclinical AK-antiVEGF program is focused on vestibular schwannoma, an inner ear condition of complex etiology. Vestibular schwannomas are among the most common intracranial tumors and affect approximately 200,000 individuals in the United States and Europe. In the United States, over 3,000 new vestibular schwannoma cases 

28



are diagnosed each year. Vestibular schwannoma may result in a variety of symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, headaches, and impaired balance. In rare cases, they can result in death. The current standard of care consists of surgical tumor resection or removal and/or radiation, both of which typically result in lost hearing and can be associated with significant morbidity. Investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Eye and Ear have published results from clinical trials showing that systemic VEGF inhibitor therapy can reduce schwannoma volume and improve hearing in some participants who had mutations in the NF2 gene. We believe an AAVAnc80 vector containing the gene that encodes a secreted anti-VEGF protein, delivered to the inner ear in the same manner as other programs in our pipeline, has the potential to stabilize tumor size and preserve hearing, while avoiding the systemic side effects of high dose intravenous VEGF inhibitor infusion and removing or reducing the need for invasive surgery and/or radiation.
We completed nonclinical studies involving direct intracochlear administration of AAVAnc80 encoding anti-VEGF protein to wild-type mice to assess tolerability, and to determine secreted levels of anti-VEGF protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Protein expression results from this mouse study supported further evaluation of AK-antiVEGF in non-human primates to understand the measurable levels of anti-VEGF protein in cochlear fluids and tissues after intracochlear administration. Local expression and tolerability of intracochlear administration of AAVAnc80 was also evaluated in non-human primates. An independent group assessed auditory function and cochlear histology. ABRs were measured prior to surgery and up to four times following surgery at one, two, three, and six months. AK-antiVEGF was well tolerated and auditory function and hair cell integrity were preserved for the duration of the study in non-human primates. Measurable levels of anti-VEGF protein within biologically active ranges were observed in perilymph, the fluid within the inner ear. A second nonclinical study in non-human primates evaluated multiple doses of AK-antiVEGF. Data from both studies demonstrate that systemic exposure to anti-VEGF protein is limited and that AK-antiVEGF is well tolerated. Observed levels of anti-VEGF protein in the perilymph and computational modeling support the potential for diffusion of reported biologically active anti-VEGF protein levels to the typical location of early vestibular schwannoma tumors.
Nonclinical Data in Non-Human Primates Demonstrate Delivery of AK-antiVEGF is Well-Tolerated and Results in Potentially Therapeutic Protein Expression
We completed a pre-IND meeting with FDA in October 2020. We conducted IND-enabling studies in 2021 and we are targeting an IND submission, for AK-antiVEGF for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma, to FDA in 2022.
Additional Pipeline Programs
Hair Cell Targets
In addition to AK-OTOF, we are developing our pipeline to focus on other monogenic gene mutations of hair cells.

29



AK-CLRN1. Inherited mutations in genes expressed in hair cells are also responsible for the hearing loss component of Usher syndrome, which is the most common hereditary deaf-blind condition, affecting over 40,000 people in the United States and Europe, which includes up to 6% of children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Our AK-CLRN1 program is initially focused on the auditory manifestations of Usher syndrome 3A, or USH3A, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by progressive loss of both hearing and vision, with post-lingual onset typically in the first decade of life. Hearing loss becomes Profound as the condition progresses. Usher syndrome 3A represents up to 5% of all Usher syndrome cases overall, suggesting a prevalence of up to 2,000 individuals in the United States and Europe. Currently, CIs are the only available intervention for the long-term auditory manifestations of Usher syndrome. Individuals with USH3A have mutations in the clarin-1 gene, CLRN1, that reduce the production and localization of CLRN1 protein to the inner hair cell and outer hair cell membranes. Although the specific function of CLRN1 has not been determined, studies suggest that it plays a role in communication between neurons in the inner ear and in the retina and may be important for the development and function of synapses. 
We are developing an AAVAnc80 vector encoding a functional version of the CLRN1 gene and have generated nonclinical data in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University, demonstrating restoration of hearing in an animal model that recapitulates the auditory pathophysiology observed in humans. An earlier study of AAV delivery in a mouse model demonstrated rescued hearing in newborn mice. We believe successful CLRN1 gene transfer could provide an effective treatment of USH3A sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to USH3A, we believe other hereditary deaf-blind conditions could be treated with AAVAnc80-based gene therapies. In 2020, we identified a product candidate for the AK-CLRN1 program. The next key milestone will be a pre-IND meeting with FDA.
Autosomal Dominant Hearing Loss. We believe that autosomal dominant mutations can be addressed by AAV-meditated RNA interference or gene editing. There are approximately 48 identified genes associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, which gives us the opportunity to develop therapeutic medicines using knockdown or gene editing modalities. We are currently developing AAVAnc80 vectors encoding RNA interference sequences intended to knock down toxic gain-of-function and dominant negative mutations responsible for autosomal dominant hearing loss and we are collecting nonclinical data on several potential targets. In February 2022, we presented nonclinical data that showed, with both microRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, a reduction of protein expression for the target autosomal dominant hearing loss gene. The data showed no measurable decrease in the protein product of a codon-modified add-back target gene, suggesting that the microRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 constructs are selective for the intended endogenous sequence. We continue to consider targets for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.
Supporting Cell Targets
We are also leveraging our precision genetic medicine platform to address hearing loss related to genes needed for supporting cell function.
GJB2. One of the most common forms of monogenic hearing loss is caused by a mutation in GJB2, encoding the connexin 26 gap junction protein, or Cx26, which is expressed in non-sensory cells of the inner ear such as the supporting cells. Cx26 forms gap junctions, or channels, between cells that are essential for maintaining the appropriate distribution of ions in cochlear fluids. For example, Cx26 is believed to be required for maintenance of the endocochlear potential, an electric voltage in the cochlear fluid spaces that is needed for hair cells to convert sound waves into electrical activity. We believe that AAVAnc-mediated delivery of GJB2 could restore gap junctions and subsequently re-establish endocochlear potential, prevent hair cell and neuron degeneration, and restore hearing thresholds. The lack of functional Cx26 causes nonsyndromic hearing loss that is usually Severe-to-Profound and pre-lingual. The prevalence of hearing loss resulting from GJB2 mutations is believed to be at least 200,000 individuals in the United States and Europe. Additionally, several published nonclinical studies support our belief that AAV vector-mediated delivery of GJB2 has the potential to improve hearing by demonstrating that delivery of GJB2 to Gjb2 knock-out mice restored gap junctions and improved hearing. We are currently conducting nonclinical studies in collaboration with researchers at University of Michigan and have observed that AAVAnc-mediated delivery of GJB2 to supporting cells partially restored hearing in neonatal mouse models representing the spectrum of hearing loss observed in humans with GJB2-mediated hearing loss. In 2021, we generated nonclinical data that describe multiple potential product candidate options. In February 2022, we presented nonclinical data that demonstrated that a combination of AAVAnc80 and a supporting cell selective promoter can drive widespread GJB2 expression in supporting cells, while limiting expression in, and loss

of, hair cells in mature cochleae in wild-type mice. We continue to evaluate the most promising product candidate options in mice and non-human primates.
Regeneration. Data from multiple independent academic and third-party industry research teams suggest supporting cell development pathways can be altered in order to regenerate hair cells that have been lost due to a wide range of causes, including noise and ototoxic drugs. Many forms of hearing loss, both genetic and environmental, are caused by the loss of hair cells in the inner ear. Because cells of the cochlea are non-dividing, hearing loss due to lost hair cells is considered irreversible. Age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss affect millions of people in the United States and Europe. The World Health Organization also estimates that 1.1 billion children and adults ages 12 to 35 years old are at risk for hearing loss from recreational noise exposure. Damage often accumulates over several years, manifesting with Mild to Moderate hearing loss by 50 to 70 years of age and deteriorating to Severe-to-Profound hearing loss by 70 to 80 years of age. We are collaborating with the Bionics Institute to test the ability of AAVAnc to transduce supporting cells that could transdifferentiate into mature, functional hair cells. Our studies in non-human primates have suggested that the AAVAnc80 vector can transduce several supporting cell sub-types that could transdifferentiate into functional hair cells. Currently, we are in the process of evaluating several development candidate leads to identify those with the potential to regenerate mature, functional hair cells in multiple animal models. We believe that AAVAnc gene therapy has the potential to restore hearing in individuals with a wide range of environmental hearing loss by regenerating hair cells from neighboring supporting cells. We have identified multiple factors that, when delivered in combination, result in new hair cell formation in neonate mice, and we plan to continue preclinical development work in 2022.
Other Discovery Programs
We are evaluating additional hearing or deaf-blind conditions, and we intend to continue to identify areas with high unmet need where our precision genetic medicine platform could potentially restore, improve, and preserve hearing.
Our Manufacturing Approach
We are building advanced internal AAV process development and manufacturing capabilities. As a result of the size of the ear, the dose of product candidate necessary for administration is low, particularly in contrast to AAV gene therapies that have been developed to treat conditions where systemic administration of viral vectors is needed and/or for targeting of larger organs. We believe we will only need to deliver a small volume and low doses of vector for near-complete transduction of target cells in the cochlea by the vector. Accordingly, a single manufacturing run should be able to yield doses for a significant number of patients, and commercial vector production may not require scale-up beyond what is required for clinical development. We are developing scalable manufacturing capabilities for both gene therapy and gene editing. 
Our process development and manufacturing strategy is to leverage our scalable precision genetic medicine platform to facilitate rapid progress to clinical development. Our expertise covers development from vector design through product manufacture, and we are able to leverage capabilities, expertise, and learnings across multiple product candidates to achieve platform efficiencies. 

Our production process utilizes a well-characterized system and commonly used host cell for many clinical stage AAV vector products. Additionally, these cells are familiar to regulatory authorities. We have established relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers for IND-enabling nonclinical supply and cGMP manufacturing to support clinical development of AK-OTOF and AK-antiVEGF.
We have and plan to continue to partner with third-party manufacturers for production of IND-enabling nonclinical and cGMP material for our lead product candidate, AK-OTOF. We have performed production runs at various scales, including those at which we intend to produce clinical and future commercial vectors. We expect to complete the AK-OTOF cGMP manufacturing campaign to support an IND submission in the first half of 2022.
We are building a cGMP manufacturing facility, including a 200 to 250-liter single use bioreactor scale using suspension HEK293 cells, that will have capability to produce gene therapy batches to support activities through Phase 

31



1/2 clinical trials for our product candidates. Our manufacturing facility will leverage single use, disposable, closed system operations aligned to our precision genetic medicine platform to promote both flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Our manufacturing facility is expected to be available for cGMP manufacturing for Phase 1/2 clinical development of product candidates beyond AK-OTOF at anticipated commercial scale. 
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a third-party manufacturer for the manufacture of our delivery device. 
Commercialization
We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to announced programs in our pipeline. We have established relationships with specialists, academic investigators, and patient advocacy organizations throughout the hearing health ecosystem. At least 50 centers in the United States have otolaryngologists and neurotologists with the expertise to perform the surgical procedure we intend to use, initially in our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AK-OTOF. We have already commenced outreach to some of these specialists to provide training on our approach. Given the well-defined and targeted nature of the otology field, if our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to establish a small specialty sales force in the United States and potentially beyond. 
Competition
We face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. These include both small companies and large companies with much greater financial and technical resources and far longer operating histories than our own. We also compete with the intellectual property, technology, and product development efforts of academic, governmental, and private research institutions.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and potentially acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of any product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from FDA or other regulators for their products before we may obtain approval for ours and may commercialize products before we are able to.
While many companies focus on gene therapies targeting blood, eye, muscle, and neurologic conditions, we are aware of certain companies with active programs in the hearing space. 
Decibel Therapeutics, Inc., or Decibel, is focused on hearing and balance conditions. Decibel’s lead gene therapy product candidate, DB-OTO, is being investigated in individuals born with Profound hearing loss due to an OTOF deficiency. DB-OTO is in preclinical development. In addition to DB-OTO, Decibel is advancing AAV.103 for potential treatment of GJB2-mediated hearing loss and AAV.104 gene therapy programs for potential treatment of stereocilin gene-mediated hearing loss. Decibel is currently developing DB-OTO, AAV.103, and AAV.104 in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Decibel is also developing a gene therapy, DB-ATO, for treatment of bilateral vestibulopathy with intent to restore balance in patients. In 2022, Decibel is targeting an IND submission and/or clinical trial application, or CTA, and, subject to the acceptance of an IND or CTA, initiation of Phase 1/2 clinical study for DB-OTO and plans to select a product candidate for AAV.103.

32



Frequency Therapeutics, Inc., or Frequency, is developing small molecule therapeutics to selectively activate progenitor cells. Frequency’s lead program is focused on regenerating hair cells through activation of progenitor cells for sensorineural hearing loss and is currently in Phase 2 trials. In 2019, Frequency announced a partnership with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, under which Astellas agreed to oversee development and commercialization of its lead program worldwide, except the United States, where Frequency will assume those responsibilities.
In 2019, Otonomy, Inc., or Otonomy, and Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, or AGTC, entered into a strategic collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize an AAV-based gene therapy to restore hearing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss caused by a mutation in GJB2. In 2020, Otonomy and AGTC selected a GJB2 product candidate, OTO-825, for further development. This program is in preclinical development. Otonomy has announced that the pre-IND meeting for OTO-825 is complete and IND-enabling activities are underway, with an IND filing anticipated in the first half of 2023.
Sensorion SA, or Sensorion, is focused on developing potential therapies for inner ear disorders. In 2019, Sensorion announced a collaboration with Institut Pasteur in gene therapy programs targeting hearing loss. The company has three preclinical gene therapy programs for the treatment of Usher Syndrome Type I, OTOF-mediated hearing loss, and GJB2-mediated hearing loss. Sensorion plans to file a CTA in the first half of 2023 for OTOF-GT and to make a candidate selection for GJB2-GT in mid-2022.
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations, data exclusivity, and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce in our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating, or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs in an effort to secure our intellectual property positions vis-à-vis these programs. Additionally, we file patent applications and in-license patents and patent applications directed to our genetic medicine platform, which includes AAVs and related technology, delivery devices and methods, and other related technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine U.S. pending non provisional patent application, 83 foreign pending patent applications, seven pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, 

33



applications, and seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and we had licenses to 30 granted U.S. and foreign patents and 50 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering our key programs and our pipeline. 
For any individual patent, the term depends on the applicable law in the country in which the patent is granted. In most countries where we have filed patent applications or in-licensed patents and patent applications, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed nonprovisional priority date. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years but may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a U.S. patent may also be lengthened by a patent term adjustment in order to address administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent.
In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension in order to restore the period of a patent term lost during the premarket FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the natural expiration of the patent. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In the future, we may decide to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant biologics license application.
The intellectual property portfolio for our most advanced programs as of December 31, 2021, is summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO may be significantly narrowed before issuance, if issued at all. We expect this may be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below.
AK-OTOF
The patent portfolio for our AK-OTOF program is based upon our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio, which includes patents and patent applications directed generally to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of delivering and using the same to treat hearing loss resulting from OTOF mutations. The in-licensed patents and patent applications are subject to license agreements with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Inc., which we refer to collectively as MEE, and Lonza Houston, Inc., or Lonza, as described herein. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or in-licensed eight U.S. patents, 19 foreign patents, and 66 pending U.S., PCT, and foreign patent applications covering our product candidate AK-OTOF, including methods of treatment of hearing loss resulting from OTOF mutations. While we believe that the specific and generic claims contained in our pending applications provide protection for the composition of matter and the method of using AK-OTOF to treat hearing loss, third parties may nevertheless challenge such claims in our patents. If any such claims are invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason, we will lose valuable intellectual property rights, and our ability to prevent others from competing with us would be impaired. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patents that may issue from pending applications that we control, if any, for our hearing program, including our lead product candidate AK-OTOF, are projected to have a statutory expiration date in between 2034 and 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, if applicable. 
AK-antiVEGF

The patent portfolio for our AK-antiVEGF program is based upon our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio which includes patents and patent applications directed generally to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of delivering and using the same to treat vestibular schwannoma. The in-licensed patents and patent applications are subject to license agreements with MEE and Lonza described herein. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or in-licensed seven U.S. patents, 13 foreign patents, and 57 pending U.S., PCT, and foreign patent applications covering our vestibular schwannoma product candidate, including methods of treatment of vestibular schwannoma. While we believe that the specific and generic claims contained in our pending applications provide protection for the composition of matter and the method of using our vestibular schwannoma candidate, third parties 

34



may nevertheless challenge such claims in our patents. If any such claims are invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason, we will lose valuable intellectual property rights, and our ability to prevent others from competing with us would be impaired. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patents that may issue from pending applications that we control, if any, for our hearing program, including our product candidate for vestibular schwannoma, are projected to have a statutory expiration date in between 2034 and 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, if applicable.
Trademark Protection
As of December 31, 2021, we held 13 U.S. trademark applications, 104 foreign trademark applications, and 43 foreign trademark registrations for the marks “Akouos,” the Akouos logo, “Resonate,” the Resonate by Akouos logo, “The Sing Registry,” and the Sing logo in connection with our biological products and related services.
Licensed Intellectual Property
Massachusetts Eye and Ear License

In October 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with MEE, or the MEE License, under which we received an exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain patent rights and know-how, including rights related to AAVAnc-, including AAVAnc80, to research, develop, make, have made, manufacture, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export, market, promote, distribute, register and otherwise commercially exploit licensed products in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, and palliation of any and all balance disorders or diseases pertaining to the inner ear and/or any and all hearing diseases or disorders, in each case, with a total prevalence in the United States of less than 3,000 patients, and an exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty bearing license under MEE’s rights, title and interest in certain patents co-owned by MEE and Children’s Medical Center Corporation, or BCH, to research, develop, make, have made, manufacture, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export, market, promote, distribute, register and otherwise commercially exploit licensed products in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, and palliation of any and all balance disorders or diseases pertaining to the inner ear and/or any and all hearing diseases or disorders, including, but not limited to, those with a total prevalence in the United States of less than 3,000 patients. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the MEE licensed products, including filing an IND or Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier in any country in the European Union or an equivalent application in any country within 18 months of completion of GLP toxicology studies for a licensed product. Under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pursue a program directed to a gene target in order to retain our rights under the agreement to such gene target. MEE is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of licensed patent rights. If MEE elects not to file, continue to prosecute or maintain such licensed patent rights in our field of use, MEE must notify us within a specified period before any applicable deadline. We would then have the right, but not the obligation, to file, continue to prosecute, or maintain the licensed patent rights. MEE has the first right, but not the duty, to enforce the licensed patents against use by a third party. If MEE does not initiate enforcement of the patents within a specified period after learning of an infringement, then we have the right, but not the duty, to initiate such enforcement efforts within our field of use of the MEE License. If a third party brings an infringement action regarding the patents within our field of use, we have the right, with respect to certain intellectual property rights in the MEE License, to defend at our own cost and expense. MEE has the right to intervene and assume control of such a defense at its own expense.

Upon entering into the MEE License, we issued shares of our common stock to MEE. We are also subject to development, regulatory, and sales milestone payment obligations in amounts corresponding to achievements denoted in the MEE License, totaling approximately $17.7 million. We are additionally obligated to pay certain royalties on a licensed product-by licensed product and country- by- country basis, beginning after the first commercial sale of an MEE licensed product in a given country and lasting until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such MEE licensed product or products commercialized using BCH’s patent rights, or the MEE Royalty Term. Such royalties shall be based on the portion of annual worldwide net sales within certain royalty tiers at percentages in the mid to high single digits denoted in the MEE License. The mere manufacture of an MEE licensed product or a product commercialized using BCH’s patent rights without a sale or other transfer does not give rise to a royalty claim under the MEE License.

35



The MEE License remains in effect until the last expiration date of the last to expire MEE Royalty Term, unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the MEE License at will, in its entirety or with respect to specific intellectual property rights licensed to us under the MEE License and with or without cause, by 90 days’ advance written notice to MEE, or upon MEE’s material breach of the MEE License, provided that MEE does not cure such material breach within a specified period. MEE has the right to terminate the MEE License in its entirety if (i) we fail to make any payment due within a specified period after MEE notifies us of such failure, (ii) we or our affiliates challenge the validity of the licensed patent rights, (iii) we fail to maintain required insurance, or (iv) we become insolvent or bankrupt. MEE also has the right to terminate our rights to specific intellectual property rights it has licensed to us under the MEE License if we materially breach certain diligence obligations and do not cure within a specified period after written notice from MEE.
Lonza Houston, Inc. Sublicense

In October 2017, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with Lonza, or the Lonza Sublicense, as amended on December 11, 2018, under which we received an exclusive, nontransferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-bearing sublicense to certain MEE patent rights and knowhow related to AAV ancestral technology, including AAVAnc80, to research, develop, make, have made, manufacture, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export, market, promote, distribute, register and otherwise commercially exploit licensed products for the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, and palliation of any and all balance disorders or diseases pertaining to the inner ear and/or any and all hearing diseases or disorders, but excluding all such disorders or diseases with a total prevalence in the United States of less than 3,000 patients. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Lonza sublicensed products, including filing an IND or Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier in any country in the European Union or an equivalent application in any country within 18 months of completion of GLP toxicology studies for a licensed product. Under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pursue a program directed to a gene target in order to retain our rights under the agreement to such gene target. MEE is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of patent rights licensed to Lonza and sublicensed by Lonza to us. If MEE elects not to file, continue to prosecute, or maintain the patent rights in the field of use sublicensed to us, MEE must notify us within a specified period before any applicable deadline. We would then have the right, but not the obligation, to file, continue to prosecute or maintain the patent rights within our field of use of the Lonza Sublicense. If we assume responsibility for the prosecution or maintenance of the patent rights in our field of use and elect not to continue prosecution or maintenance of such rights, we must notify Lonza in writing within a specified period before any applicable deadline. MEE has the first right, but not the duty, to enforce the patents against use by a third party. If MEE does not initiate enforcement of the patents within a specified period after learning of an infringement, then we shall have the right, but not the duty, to initiate such enforcement efforts within our field of use of the Lonza Sublicense. If we do not initiate efforts to cease an infringement within a specified period from which we gained the right to, then Lonza shall have the right, but not the duty, to initiate enforcement efforts. If a third party brings an infringement action regarding the patents within our field of use, we shall have the right, with respect to certain intellectual property rights in the Lonza Sublicense, to defend at our own cost and expense. MEE and/or Lonza shall have the right to intervene and assume control of such a defense at its own expense.
Upon entering into the Lonza Sublicense, we issued shares of our common stock to Lonza. We are also subject to development, regulatory, and sales milestone payment obligations in amounts corresponding to achievements denoted in the Lonza Sublicense, totaling approximately $18.5 million. We are additionally obligated to pay certain royalties beginning after the first commercial sale of a Lonza sublicensed product and lasting until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in the patent or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such Lonza sublicensed product, or the Lonza Royalty Term. Such royalties shall be based on the portion of annual worldwide net sales within certain royalty tiers at percentages in the mid to high single- digits denoted in the Lonza Sublicense. The mere manufacture of a Lonza sublicensed product without a sale or other transfer does not give rise to a royalty claim under the Lonza Sublicense.
The Lonza Sublicense remains in effect until the last expiration date of the last to expire Lonza Royalty Term, unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the Lonza Sublicense at will, in its entirety or with respect to specific intellectual property rights sublicensed to us under the Lonza Sublicense and with or without cause, by 90 days’ advance written notice to Lonza, or upon Lonza’s material breach of the Lonza Sublicense, provided that Lonza does not cure such material breach within a specified period. Lonza has the right to terminate the Lonza Sublicense in its entirety if (i) we fail to make any payment due within a specified period after Lonza notifies us of such failure, (ii) we or our 

36



affiliates challenge the validity of the sublicensed patent rights, (iii) we fail to maintain required insurance, or (iv) we become insolvent or bankrupt. Lonza also has the right to terminate our rights to specific intellectual property rights it has sublicensed to us under the Lonza Sublicense if we materially breach certain diligence obligations and do not cure within a specified period after written notice from Lonza.
In October 2017, we entered into a Letter Agreement Regarding Sublicense of Ancestral Technology, or the Letter Agreement, with MEE regarding the Lonza Sublicense. The purpose of the Letter Agreement was to confirm the understanding between MEE and us regarding the patent rights and know-how sublicensed to us in the Lonza Sublicense.
MEE consented to the execution, delivery, and performance of the Lonza Sublicense and agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the Lonza Sublicense which are expressly applicable to each of them to the same extent as if they were each a party to the Lonza Sublicense. To the extent that any terms of the Lonza Sublicense conflict with the terms of the license agreement Lonza entered into in August 2016 with MEE, or the Lonza License, the terms of the Lonza Sublicense shall control. MEE also agreed to waive and release any and all rights to enforce terms, conditions, and provisions of the Lonza License which conflict with the Lonza Sublicense. Between the MEE License and the Lonza Sublicense, we have the license rights to any and all balance disorders or diseases pertaining to the inner ear and/or any and all hearing diseases or disorders described above at all prevalence levels.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States
In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and its implementing regulations and guidance. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. The failure of a sponsor to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including nonclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review, and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.
A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:


● | nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with FDA’s GLP regulations and other applicable regulations and standards;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and submission to FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37




● | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the nonclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and GCP, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nonclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo nonclinical testing. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to FDA as part of an IND application.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless before that time FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.
As a result, submission of the IND may result in FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or at any time following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds are imposed by FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety, may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or where there is non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by FDA could delay either a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing our planned clinical trial or future clinical trials in a timely manner.

Additionally, gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, also are potentially subject to review by a committee within the NIH’s Office of Science Policy called the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory, or the NExTRAC. As of 2019, the charter of this review group has evolved to focus public review on clinical trials that cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. With certain gene therapy protocols, FDA review of or clearance to allow the IND to proceed could be delayed if the NExTRAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the 

39



sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB has access.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.


● | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the trial will be sufficient to satisfy FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
In some cases, FDA may approve a BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after licensure. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated 

40



approval regulations. If FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Both the NIH and FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. 
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, FDA, and FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. 
Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
We expect that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products will be applied to any product candidates we may develop. FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient.
Within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The NIH, including NExTRAC, also advises the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging biotechnologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including recent final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information for gene therapy INDs, long-term follow-up after the administration of gene therapy products, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product 

41



candidate. The guidance documents provide additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe for potential delayed adverse effects in participants who have received investigational gene therapies with the duration of follow-up based on the potential for risk of such effects. For AAV vectors specifically, FDA typically recommends that sponsors continue to monitor participants for potential gene therapy related adverse events for up to a five-year period.
Until 2019, most gene therapy clinical trials in the United States required pre-review by the predecessor of NExTRAC before being approved by the IRBs and any local biosafety boards or being allowed to proceed by the FDA. In 2019, the NIH substantially eliminated the pre-review process and going forward, the review of gene therapy clinical trial protocols would be largely handled by local IRBs and Institutional Biosafety Committees, in addition to FDA. Furthermore, in 2019, the NIH removed from public access the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System database, which previously contained substantial amounts of safety and other participant information regarding human gene therapy trials performed up to that time.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
In connection with review of a BLA, FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
Submission and Filing of a BLA
The results of product candidate development, nonclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of a licensed BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. It must inform the sponsor of that determination within 60 days. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information, or scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing.

42



Once the submission has been accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by FDA under the PDUFA, FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the sponsor, and six months for a priority review of the application. FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if FDA requests or if the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Decisions on a BLA

FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product candidate is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. Ultimately, FDA will determine whether the expected benefits of the proposed new product outweigh its potential risks to patients. On the basis of FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, FDA will issue either a complete response letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. 
​
A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by FDA, at which time FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six- month extension to respond.   
​
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. FDA may limit the approved indication(s) for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s efficacy and/or safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Combination Products

              A combination product is a product composed of any combination of a drug and a device; a biological product and a device; a drug and a biological product; or a drug, device, and a biological product. Under FDA’s regulations, a 

43



combination product is defined to include a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity (a “single-entity” combination product); two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products (“co-packaged” combination product); a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product (a “cross-labeled” combination product); or any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect (a “cross-labeled” investigational combination product).

              FDA has established an Office of Combination Products to serve as a focal point for combination product issues and for medical product classification and assignment issues for agency staff and industry.  That office issues guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products and is responsible for assigning products to an FDA center for premarket review and regulation where their classification or assignment is unclear or in dispute. Combination products are assigned to an FDA center based on a determination of the “primary mode of action,” or PMOA, of the combination product. The FDCA defines PMOA as “the single mode of action of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product.” For example, if the PMOA of a device-biological combination product is attributable to the biological product, the FDA division responsible for premarket review of that biological product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. One investigational application is generally sufficient for a combination product, but that application must include all information on the entire combination product. In most cases, the type of investigational application is that typically required by the lead center. Thus, if the drug constituent part of a drug/device combination product provides the PMOA, the investigation would be under an IND. 
​
Expedited Review Programs
FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
Any product candidate submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval. None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.

● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

44




● | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative medicine advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative medicine advanced therapies, or RMAT. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of an RMAT designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review, and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. In a recent guidance on expedited programs for regenerative medicine therapies for serious conditions, FDA specified that its interpretation of the definition of regenerative medicine advanced therapy products includes gene therapies that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues, such as in vivo AAV vectors delivered to non-dividing cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Approval Regulation
If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to FDA. FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or 

45



imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:


● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Although healthcare providers may prescribe products for uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, in their professional judgment, drug manufacturers are prohibited from soliciting, encouraging or promoting unapproved uses of a product. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by FDA, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. In September 2021, FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug product.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.

46



A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. 
The concept of what constitutes the “same drug” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and FDA has issued final guidance suggesting that it would not consider two gene therapy products to be different drugs solely based on minor differences in the transgenes or vectors within a given vector class. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by FDA. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by FDA.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
​
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, requiring FDA to award priority review vouchers, or PRVs, to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of “rare pediatric diseases” by, upon initial approval of an application meeting certain specified criteria, providing companies with a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease product receiving a PRV may sell or otherwise transfer the voucher to another company. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the 

47



voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted an application relying on the priority review voucher. FDA may also revoke any PRV if the rare pediatric disease product for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the United States within one year following the date of approval. 
​
In order to receive a PRV upon BLA or NDA approval, the product must receive designation from the FDA as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to submission of the marketing application. A “rare pediatric disease” is a disease that is serious or life-threatening, in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 people in the United States but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such product. In addition to receiving rare pediatric disease designation, in order to receive a PRV, the NDA or BLA must be given priority review, rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the product intended for that population, not seek approval for a different adult indication in the original rare pediatric disease product application and be for a product that does not include a previously approved active ingredient. 
​
The Rare Pediatric Disease PRV program was scheduled to expire after September 30, 2020. After that, only drugs designated as rare pediatric treatments and approved by FDA by October 1, 2022, could receive a voucher.  In December 2020, however, Congress renewed the program as part of the 2021 Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Consolidated Appropriations Act through the federal fiscal year 2024.  Thus, under the current statutory sunset provisions, FDA may only award PRVs for approved rare pediatric disease product applications if sponsors have rare pediatric disease designation for the drug granted by September 30, 2024. FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease PRVs after September 30, 2026. 
​
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an existing FDA licensed “reference product.” To date, FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own nonclinical data and data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.

Federal and State Data Privacy and Security Laws
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes, and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their regulations, including the omnibus final rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales, and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
In the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND, clearing clinical studies and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend 

49



the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with FDA.
FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics
In August 2014, FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products. In April 2020, FDA issued additional guidance which describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate.
The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, nonclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain premarket approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. 
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed 

50



indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical Trial Approval
On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one member state of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public.
The main characteristics of the regulation include a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting EU Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted or concerned member states. Part II is assessed separately by each concerned member state. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website.
PRIME Designation in the European Union
In March 2016, the EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small and medium sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures 

51



administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, a sponsor must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Specialized Procedures for Gene Therapies
The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for gene therapy products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC includes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Pediatric Studies
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, sponsors must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, 

52



pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, nonclinical tests, and clinical trials.
Patent Term Extensions in the European Union and Other Jurisdictions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict 

53



compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the sponsor must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.
Pediatric Exclusivity
If a sponsor obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the SPC.
Authorization to Market Companion Diagnostics in the European Union
​
In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR, which came into force on May 26, 2021, and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark of Conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold.
​
To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Union for medical devices.
Separately, the regulatory authorities in the European Union also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, or IVDR, (EU) 2017/746, which will become effective in May 2022. The new regulation will replace the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device have until May 2022 to update their technical documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent regulation.
​

54



Once applicable, the regulation will, among other things:
​

● | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took place on January 31, 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the European Union and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like a European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable European Union Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the

personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products will apply to any companion diagnostics.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

If we obtain approval in the future to market in the United States any product candidates we may develop, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious, or fraudulent or knowingly making, using, or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. In addition, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control, and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.

58



The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden revoked those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical Prices
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations.  These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, HHS and FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which has been delayed until January 1, 2026 pursuant to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals.  The executive order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.”  On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices.  The key features of that plan are to (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement

constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
