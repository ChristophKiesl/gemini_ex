Sales and Client Acquisition
 
We primarily sell our products and services via business to business (B2B) or business to government (B2G) model. We use a direct and an indirect sales model to sell our services and the type of sales approach we use often depends on the nature of the opportunity. Our sales cycle is long and is often affected by many factors outside of our control including but not limited to client specific proposal and acquisition processes, unique client service requirements, the client’s timetable and urgency, changes in key leadership and/or personnel that slows down the proposal or project, budgetary funding and other constraints, and many other factors that may lengthen the sales cycle. Many of these variables are outside our control and we attempt to manage the financial impact on us by building a large pipeline with opportunities that have overlapping sales cycles.

We may utilize one or more of the following approaches to fill our sales pipeline:
 
Direct Sales Approach. We utilize an in-house sales team to manage the entire federal, state and local sales process including lead generation, product demonstrations, proposal creation and submission, contract negotiation and closing and final transition of closed deals to the operations team. We utilize a direct sales approach in the U.S market to identify, sell and close both commercial and government opportunities. Sales commissions are paid to our direct sales representative over the life of the initial contract term on a declining or at a fixed rate as a percentage of net collected gross managed service revenues.
Indirect Sales Approach. We outsource our lead generation and certain business development activities through third party channel partners. Our channel partners understand our product and service offerings and they utilize their sales team to generate leads and connect us with prospective clients using their extensive networks. Channel partners are compensated in the form of a sales commission for deals that are successfully closed. Sales commissions have historically been paid over the life of the initial contract term as a percentage of net collected gross managed service revenues.
Strategic Partner and Alliance Sales Approach. Strategic partnerships and alliances provide us with additional access to potential clients. We may team up with other companies and competitors to bid on a project that includes one or more of our services as part of a larger service solicitation. In these types of arrangements we may operate as either the prime contractor or subcontractor.
 
Our global sales team has a wide variety of skills and expertise to cultivate qualified leads and guide our prospective customers towards finding a solution that meets their organization’s goals and objectives.
 
Marketing and Branding
 
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our solutions in our target markets that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision markers involved in the sales process on the customer side. Key decisions makers typically consist of information technology executives, finance executives and managers of communications assets and networks.
 
We engage in a wide variety of marketing activities designed to broaden market awareness of our solutions, including e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage existing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target market and demonstrate and promote our software and services at trade shows targeted to information technology and finance executives.
 
We also publish white papers relating to telecom life cycle management and identity management issues and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of these risks to an organization.

Client Concentrations 
 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by federal government agencies for which we act in the capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. We believe that contracts with federal government agencies in particular, will be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future although we are working to increase our footprint with commercial clients. Accordingly, changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies (including continuing budget resolutions) will directly affect our financial performance.
 
We expect our federal customers to be motivated to meet their organizational missions for cybersecurity and objectives to minimize telecommunications and other significant costs in this challenging environment. We believe these actions may result in lower profit margins across the federal contracting industry in whole if government spending in all areas is reduced; however, we believe we have an attractive set of solutions for both the cybersecurity and cost savings arenas.
 
Our government client base is located predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. while our commercial client base is located throughout the continental U.S., Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of federal government contracts.
 
Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the size and number of commercial customer contracts.
 
Government Contracts 
 
We have numerous government contracts and contract vehicles. Contract vehicles include Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”), and Blanket Purchase Agreements (“BPAs”) based upon General Services Administration (“GSA”) Schedule 70, and customer specific contracts. We also hold a number of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“ID/IQ”) contracts, including, but not limited to:

§ | Department of Health and Human Services Telecommunications Inventory and Expense Management Solutions contract. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | The Federal Bureau of Investigation Explosive Reference Tool (EXPeRT). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Subsidiaries of WidePoint are approved subcontractors for the following ID/IQ contracts: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | GSA Alliant Small Business
--+---------------------------


o | GSA Networx
--+------------


o | GSA Connections II
--+-------------------


o | National Institutes of Health Chief Information Officer Solutions and Partners (CIO-SP3) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Program Management and Support Services (PMSS) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Department of Justice Information Technology Support Services (“ITSS”) 3 contract 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also have various relationships with other contractors that allow us to act as a subcontractor, thereby providing us access to various other contracts and contract vehicles in biometrics and identity management infrastructure support, and Information Technology Support Services.
 
Our contracts with the federal government, and many contracts with other entities, permit the government client to modify, curtail or terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government, or for default by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we are generally reimbursed for our allowable costs through the date of termination and are paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed.

Product Development and Technology Solution Enhancements
 
We may fund certain product development initiatives to enhance or customize existing client facing platforms and software solutions. These initiatives are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software solutions and our customizing a solution to meet our customer’s organizational requirements, if necessary. We determine which enhancements to further develop after assessing the market capabilities sought by potential customers, considering technological advances, feedback on enhancements from our current customer user groups and other factors. Our current development activities are focused on the integration of our software based platforms, certain enhancements to improve the delivery of our information technology services delivered through these platforms.
 
We utilize a standard architecture to ensure enhancements are subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny and a consistent and efficient process. Our development team is comprised of professionals with hands-on technical and practical client-side development experience. We believe this allows us to design and deploy enhancements that can resolve real-world problems in a timely manner.
 
We funded and expensed strategic product development initiatives including Certificate-on-Device, derived credentialing and other credentialing offerings as well as platform and portal integrations and other product and portal enhancements totaling approximately $699,000 in 2016 and $673,000 in 2015. In 2017, we will continue to work with our strategic partners to continue and focus our product development efforts as well as with client integrations.
 
Data Centers
 
We host our proprietary solutions and operate all servers, systems and networks at six (6) data centers located in Ireland, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia, which we may consolidate in the future. Our agreements with our customers contain guarantees regarding specified levels of system availability, and we regularly provide our customers with performance reports against those standards. We deploy monitoring technology that continuously checks the servers and key underlying components at regular intervals for availability and performance, ensuring availability to our customers. Each data center provides security measures, redundant environmental controls, fire suppression systems and redundant electrical generators to meet our service level agreements. To facilitate data loss recovery, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server pools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. The architecture is designed to ensure near real-time data recovery in the event of a malfunction of a primary server. Based on customer requirements, we can also provide near real-time asynchronous data replication between operational and disaster recovery backup sites.
Intellectual Property 
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop software or services with the same functionality as our software and services.

U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
 
Competition and Pricing
 
Our competitive market is highly fragmented and we compete with companies from a variety of market sectors. Many of our competitors have greater resources than us and are often able to offer more scale and more services for larger prospective clients seeking a total technology solution set in our target market. Our key competitors currently include Tangoe, Inc., Calero, KEYW Holding Corporation, Verisign, Identrust, SureID, DigiCert, Entrust, and other organizations; all of which have varying specialties within the telecommunications market place. Due to our significant federal government contract concentrations we also experience competition from a variety of both large and small companies, including divisions of large federal government integrators such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and other large and mid-sized federal contractors, as well as a limited number of small to mid-sized subject matter expert organizations offering specialized capabilities within the identity management space.
 
Prospective clients in our target market use a wide array of contract vehicles to purchase technology services ranging from individual purchase orders, awards or consolidated service contracts that cover a range of technology services, of which we may or may not be able to provide all of the services to serve as the prime contractor. The same companies that are our competitors will, at times, team with us or subcontract with us in the pursuit of consolidated opportunities from very large Fortune 100 companies.
 
Many of our competitors are heavily discounting their services to unprofitable levels in an effort to maintain market share and push other competitors out of the market and then turn around and raise prices for its captive customer base. This type of pricing behavior affects the entire market, creates a commodity pricing environment that directly affects the level of services that can be delivered to meet the customers’ requirements and ensure a reasonable return for the service provider. If we are unable to keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, deliver cost-effective and relevant solutions to our target market, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.
 
We believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days in a quarter, the timing of the pass-through of other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 279 full-time employees (237 in the U.S. and 42 in Europe). We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary employees. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
