Item 1. Business
Armstrong Flooring, Inc. ("AFI" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015. When we refer to "we," "our," and "us" in this report, we are referring to Armstrong Flooring, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading global producer of resilient flooring products for use primarily in the construction and renovation of commercial, residential and institutional buildings. We design, manufacture, source and sell flooring products primarily in North America and the Pacific Rim.
On April 1, 2016, we became an independent company as a result of the separation by Armstrong World Industries, Inc. ("AWI"), a Pennsylvania corporation, of its Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments from its Building Products segment (the "Separation"). The Separation was effected by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to AWI’s shareholders (the "Distribution"). The Separation and Distribution (together, the "Spin-off") resulted in AFI and AWI becoming two independent, publicly traded companies, with AFI owning and operating the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments and AWI continuing to own and operate a ceilings business.
In November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our North American wood flooring business to Tarzan Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of American Industrial Partners. The sale was completed on December 31, 2018. The historical financial results of the North American wood flooring business have been reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Subsequent to the sale of the North American wood flooring business, the Company's results are part of a single reportable segment. 
During early 2020, the Company established a multi-year strategic roadmap to transform and modernize its operations to become a leaner, faster-growing and more profitable business. The transformation encompasses three critical objectives: (i) expanding customer reach; (ii) simplifying product offerings and operations; and (iii) strengthening core capabilities. In addition, the Company has implemented a new operating model to more effectively accomplish these objectives by: (i) placing customers first by aligning services and products through a more seamless value chain; (ii) leading the industry in product innovation; (iii) simplifying processes and operating complexity to become more competitive and efficient; (iv) realigning the go-to-market model to reach all relevant channels and customers; (v) implementing system changes to improve operations, reduce costs and reignite organic growth; and (vi) investing thoughtfully with a return-focused mindset. The goal of this focused strategy is to transform and modernize AFI, resulting in a company that is more agile, faster-growing and more profitable. 
Markets
We hold leadership or significant market share positions in the majority of the product categories and markets in which we operate. We compete exclusively in the resilient flooring product category in North America and the Pacific Rim. The majority of our sales are in North America, where we serve both commercial and residential markets. In the Pacific Rim, we are principally focused on commercial markets. Our business operates in a competitive environment across all our product categories and excess capacity exists in much of the industry.  We continue to see efforts by various competitors to price aggressively as a means to gain market share. The major markets in which we compete are: 
North American Commercial — Our products are used in commercial, institutional buildings and multi-family housing. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Industry analysts estimate that renovation work represents the majority of the total North American commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from three major segments of commercial building: education, healthcare and retail. During 2020, the Company has also begun to explore expansion into the hospitality segment which represents a new growth opportunity. We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as twenty-four months given that the installation of flooring typically occurs later in the construction process. We also monitor architectural activity, gross domestic product ("GDP") and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. We also believe that consumer preferences for product type, style, color, availability, performance attributes and affordability significantly affect our revenue.
North American Residential — We sell products for use in single and multi-family housing. Homeowners, contractors, builders, and property management firms can choose from our innovative flooring products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. Our flooring products also compete with carpet, stone, wood and ceramic products, which we do not offer.
Our products are used in new home construction and existing home renovation work. Industry analysts estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement/remodel) work represents a majority of the total North American residential market opportunity. We monitor key U.S. statistics including existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence. We believe there is some longer-term correlation between these statistics and our revenue after reflecting a lag period of several months between a change in these indicators and our operating results. However, we believe that consumers’ preferences for product type, style, color, availability, performance attributes and affordability also significantly affect our revenue. Further, changes in inventory levels and/or product focus at national home centers and independent wholesale flooring distributors can significantly affect our revenue.
Outside of North America — We also serve commercial markets in the Pacific Rim region with approximately 90% of the sales in this region coming from China and Australia. The commercial segments we serve are similar to the North American market (healthcare, education, and retail). However, there is a higher penetration of resilient flooring in the hospitality and infrastructure segments in China than we see in North America. For the countries where we have significant revenue, we monitor various national statistics (such as GDP) as well as construction data (starts and project-related information).
The following table provides an estimate of our net sales, by major markets(a): 

North American Commercial | North American Residential | Outside of North America | 
New | Renovation | New | Renovation | New | Renovation | Total
10% | 30% | 5% | 40% | 10% | 5% | 100% 

(a) Management has estimated the above data as the ultimate end-use of our products is not easily determinable. Management believes these estimates to be consistent year-over-year.
Demand for our products is influenced by economic conditions. We closely monitor publicly available macroeconomic trend data that provides insight to commercial and residential market activity; this includes GDP growth indices, the Architecture Billings Index and the Consumer Confidence Index, as well as housing starts and existing home sales. In addition, our channel partners raise or lower their inventory levels according to their expectations of market demand and consumer preferences, which directly affects our sales. 
Products
Luxury vinyl tile ("LVT") - LVT represents the fastest growing resilient flooring product category. Through enhanced wear layers and coatings, LVT delivers improved durability and lower maintenance over traditional vinyl tile. In addition, the utilization of advanced printing and embossing technology provides LVT with upgraded visual realism in a wide variety of attractive wood and stone designs. LVT’s modular format offers a wide range of installation options for the professional and do-it-yourself installer, with an enhanced ease of installation when compared to other products such as wood or ceramic tile; this can be seen with the growing popularity of floating and rigid LVT floors. The largest market for LVT is North America. We believe LVT growth has and will continue to come partially at the expense of other product categories in both the soft and hard surface flooring markets.
Vinyl composition tile ("VCT") - VCT is a flooring material composed of polyvinylchloride ("PVC") chips formed into solid sheets and cut into modular shapes that offers a classic look and economical value. We are the largest producer of VCT which is primarily used in commercial environments. The market for VCT is a mature and well-structured category and has continued to experience a softening in demand due to customer trends, which have continued to favor alternate products, including LVT products.
Vinyl sheet - Vinyl sheet is a resilient flooring product that comes in a roll that is cut to size. Vinyl sheet performs in high-traffic settings and is low maintenance. Our product Rejuvenations™ Restore™ addresses heath care concerns of both comfort and sound. We produce and sell vinyl sheet product for both residential and commercial markets. We continue to experience a decline in demand for our traditional resilient products, particularly residential vinyl sheet products. The decline in vinyl sheet is driven by loss of market share to competitors as well as consumer trends, which have continued to favor alternate products, including LVT products. During 2020, we introduced the industry's first non-PVC vinyl sheet system, Medinpure™, for use in healthcare applications, which was recognized by many trade publications and industry organizations. 
Customers
We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We sell products through both independent wholesale flooring distributors, who re-sell our products to retailers, builders, contractors, installers and others as well as direct to specialty retailers. In the commercial sector, we also have important relationships with subcontractors’ alliances, large architectural firms, large design firms and major facility owners in our focus segments. In the North American retail channel, which sells to end-users in the residential and light commercial segments, we have important relationships with several national home centers and flooring retailers. Additionally, we also have important relationships with major home builders and retail buying groups in the North American residential sector. 
Approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 were to distributors. Sales to large home centers accounted for approximately 16% of our consolidated sales in 2020. Our remaining sales were primarily to other retailers, end-use customers and contractors. One customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales in 2020. 
Competition
We face strong competition in all of our businesses. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition in North America comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions. Our resilient flooring products compete with carpet, stone, wood, ceramic products, rubber and stained or polished concrete. There is excess industry capacity for certain products in some geographies, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies are our primary competitors: Beaulieu International Group N.V., Creative Flooring Solution, Congoleum Corporation, Engineered Floors, LLC, Forbo Holding AG, Gerflor Group, HMTX Industries (including Metroflor Corporation), Interface, Inc. (including Nora Systems GmbH), LG Floors, Mannington Mills, Inc., Mohawk Industries, Inc., Shaw Industries, Inc. and Tarkett AG. We also compete with private label brokers.
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials include: PVC resins and films, plasticizers, fiberglass and felt backings, limestone, pigments, inks, stabilizers and coatings.
We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity, natural gas and water.
In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements, we believe alternative supply arrangements would be available.
Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs. During the fourth quarter of 2020 there was a resin shortage due to a hurricane and COVID-19. This caused a temporary increase in the price of resin, which is used to make PVC.
Sourced Products
Some of our products are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include LVT, vinyl sheet, installation and maintenance materials and accessories. We purchase most of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Asia. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 30% of our total consolidated revenue in 2020. 
In general, adequate supplies of sourced products are available. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations including tariffs, production and transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements, we believe alternative supply arrangements would be available.
Recent trends in shipping have extended delivery times for certain products and materials, primarily from China and Vietnam. While we expect this to be temporary in nature, we cannot reasonably predict when the imbalance of global shipping capacity and demand will end. 
Tariffs
Tariffs impact the cost of products we import from China. The U.S. government announced a tariff of 10% on certain flooring products imported to the U.S. from China, effective on September 24, 2018 with an additional 15% effective on May 10, 2019. In order to partially offset the impact, we implemented price increases that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2018, and additional price increases that went into effect in the second quarter of 2019 on select impacted products. On November 8, 2019, an exclusion on tariffs of certain flooring products was announced. The exclusion applied retroactively to September 24, 2018. Additional products were added to the exclusion in the second quarter of 2020, also retroactive to September 24, 2018. The exclusions expired in August 2020. We filed for tariff refunds on these products in 2020 and recorded refunds as a reduction of previously recorded expense once formal approval was received. Upon expiration of the exclusion, we implemented a price increase on select impacted products to offset the expense of the tariffs.
Seasonality
Generally, our sales in North America tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and education renovations typical during the summer months. We see similar patterns with respect to our sales in the Pacific Rim, though the timing of the Chinese New Year can affect buying behaviors in the first fiscal quarter.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
Patent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by U.S. and foreign patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AFI, including those before and after the Spin-off, or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
An example of patented technology includes Diamond 10® Technology, which is patented in the United States and certain other countries.
We own or have a license to use certain trademarks, including, without limitation, Armstrong®, Alterna®, BBT®, Diamond 10® Technology, Empower™, Excelon®, Imperial®, Initiator™, Inspiring Great Spaces®, Luxe Plank®, Medintech®, Empower™, Medinpure™, Memories™, Natural Creations®, Station Square™, StrataMax® and Vivero®, which are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. This includes the new Armstrong Flooring logos developed in 2020 to strengthen and differentiate the Armstrong Flooring brand. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the mark is used and continues in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
Sustainability
We believe that a commitment to positive environmental and social practices strengthens our organization, increases our connection with our stakeholders and helps us better serve our customers and communities. Through these commitments which are embedded in our corporate strategy, we see additional ways to create value for our stockholders, our employees, our customers and the wider world. As part of this commitment, the Company focuses on operating its global footprint with minimal impact on the environment and designing products with materials and processes that are safe for both people and the planet. As a company, we recover over 90% of our generated waste and operate a closed loop product take-back program which has recycled over 150 million pounds of post-consumer flooring (since program inception prior to the Spin-off). Solar installations at our China and Australia facilities have further reduced our carbon footprint. While water recirculation and rainwater harvesting projects have eliminated over 123 million gallons of water use since 2008. We provide our employees with ongoing support through education, training, development and leadership opportunities and we prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees, stakeholders and communities. We demonstrate our commitment to environmental and social matters in many ways that can be explored on our website at www.armstrongflooring.com.
Human Capital
Overview
Armstrong Flooring had 1,552 employees globally as of December 31, 2020. Our workforce spans 1,267 employees in the U.S. and 285 employees in Canada, Australia, China, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam combined.
We are evolving our culture and our human capital strategies to best serve all these employees and align with our growth strategies and the changing social environments. Fostering a culture that is values-based, responsible, ethical and inclusive motivates and empowers our employees. This culture enables us to attract and retain the most talented people, engage them in meaningful and inspiring work; and as a result, fulfill our business goals and objectives. Our human capital philosophy is simple: Invest in people and they will return your investment in dividends. We grow together, encouraging one another to develop our own unique skills and celebrating each individual’s uniqueness, to find fulfillment, success and advancement.
Health and Safety
A key focus of our shared community is on the health, safety and well-being of our employees. We engage in continuous physical safety programs throughout our manufacturing facilities and provide mental and physical well-being programs to all employees. We quickly implemented measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure employee health, safety and well-being. In addition to encouraging all employees whose jobs permitted to work remotely, we closed our manufacturing facilities for two weeks to implement new safety protocols. We relied on the best science at the time to create new protocols such as:
•Temperature checks and touchless hand sanitizing stations throughout the plant
•Special proximity monitors to alert employees when they come within 6 feet of another person
In the U.S., we also provided free COVID-19 testing to all employees and waived sick pay/short-term disability waiting times to all employees. In order to encourage good mental and physical health we waived all fees for Teladoc visits and made other changes, including training, to promote physical and mental well-being.
Talent Development
We recognize that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must attract, develop, motivate and retain diverse, world-class talent. Through the execution of our people strategy and management succession plan, we are working to expand our talent pipeline and build a workforce with the skills necessary to thrive in the workplace of the future. Our workforce development efforts are focused on ensuring that we will maintain our leadership position in the industry and continue to provide our customers with innovative flooring solutions. We utilize digital recruiting tools to remove roadblocks typically faced by diverse candidates in applying to positions so that we can obtain a strong diverse candidate pool.
Through regular employee engagement surveys, semi-annual talent reviews, real-time discussions, available employee communication channels and a focus on our Values; we monitor the needs and expectations of our employees and respond to meet these evolving employee needs. We provide employees with ongoing opportunities to grow and develop through many different programs, including professional and leadership development, continuous performance management internal mobility. These programs and activities increased our employee engagement ratings and led to a workforce dedicated to creating value.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We recognize diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") as a business imperative. We believe that our business accomplishments are a result of the efforts of our employees around the world and that a diverse employee population will result in a better understanding of our customers’ needs. We respect the attributes that make each individual unique, including those that can be seen and those that are acquired or learned. Our DE&I purpose is to evolve the organization and our culture to reflect the customers and communities we serve, where employees can be their authentic selves and where differences in background, thought and experience are welcomed, valued and celebrated. We demonstrate purposeful actions and incorporate intentional practices to drive these inclusive behaviors in our daily work. One key example is through changes to our recruiting program, where we have digitally enabled our process to broaden the applicant pool to diverse groups that have traditionally had difficulty accessing job opportunities. This has increased the diversity of our candidate pool and our hires.
We are committed to continually reviewing our operational practices and aligning DE&I initiatives with business objectives. Our DE&I commitment is demonstrated by the establishment of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council which considers all parts of our employee experience to ensure that DE&I principles are incorporated into our talent acquisition strategies, development offerings and employee services. The Council is comprised of, and led by, our employees, with executive sponsorship up to and including our CEO.
Competitive Pay and Employee Benefits
We provide market-competitive compensation and benefits to our employees. Our pay programs are designed to be performance-based so that employees are paid based on performance that they can control. Our benefits programs are reviewed each year to ensure that we are meeting current practices in providing benefits that meet the health and safety needs of our employees. When special circumstances occur, such as the recent pandemic, we adjust our benefits to meet our employees’ needs.
Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
AFI’s manufacturing and research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of materials and the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. These regulatory requirements continually change, therefore we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures associated with compliance with environmental requirements.
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, distributors and competitors, employees and other matters. For example, we are currently a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace, or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants. In some cases, these allegations involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe these claims and allegations to be without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
On November 15, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder, based on alleged false and/or misleading statements or omissions made between March 6, 2018 and November 4, 2019.  On March 2, 2020, the court issued an order appointing a lead plaintiff and lead counsel.  On July 2, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting similar violations and expanding the alleged class period to cover alleged false and/or misleading statements or omissions made between March 6, 2018 and March 3, 2020.  On November 30, 2020, the Company reached a settlement in principle to fully resolve this matter. The agreement, which is subject to final documentation and Court approval, provides in part for a settlement payment of $3.75 million in exchange for the dismissal and a release of all claims against the defendants in connection with the securities class action suit. Neither the Company nor any individual defendant admits any wrongdoing through the settlement agreement. On January 15, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On February 23, 2021, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, preliminary certification of the settlement class and approval to provide notice to the class. The final settlement approval hearing is currently scheduled for July 19, 2021. The $3.75 million settlement payment will be paid by the Company’s insurance provider under its insurance policy. Payment is expected during 2021. 
While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations. There were no material liabilities recorded at December 31, 2020 for potential environmental liabilities on a global basis that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 19, Litigation and Related Matters, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for additional information.
