      Our Company
     DAVIDsTEA is a growing branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories, food and beverages primarily through 231 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of January 28, 2017, and our website, davidstea.com. We are building a brand that seeks to expand the definition of tea with innovative products that consumers can explore in an open and inviting retail environment. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. 
     We strive to make tea a multi‑sensory experience by facilitating interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. We design our stores with a modern and simple aesthetic that, coupled with our teal‑colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. Our in‑store “Tea Guides” help novice and experienced tea drinkers alike select from the approximately 150 premium teas and tea blends featured on our “Tea Wall,” which is the focal point of our stores. We replicate our store experience online by engaging users with rich content that allows them to easily explore their options amongst our many tea and tea‑related offerings.
     We sell a majority of our products primarily through our company-operated retail stores and e-commerce site, giving us control of the presentation of our brand as well as greater interaction with the customer, which increases our pace of innovation. We have a dedicated and highly experienced product development team that is constantly creating new tea blends using high‑quality ingredients from around the world. We bring newness and capitalize on our product development capabilities with approximately 75 new tea blends each year that we rotate into our offering on a continuous basis. We also focus on product innovation in our pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food and beverages, providing our customers with fun, inventive and more convenient ways to enjoy tea. We believe that our product development platform and level of innovation have helped us earn a strong and loyal customer following that is passionate about DAVIDsTEA.
     The strong performance of our stores across geographies demonstrates the appeal of our brand and underscores our growth opportunity. Given our retail store base, our e-commerce site and the appeal of our brand, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity across North America. Consistent with our stores, davidstea.com features our innovative products while offering expertise, community and numerous tools to aid the discovery and exploration of tea. During Fiscal 2016, approximately 66% of our revenue was driven by the sale of loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea‑related gifts that consumers enjoy at home, on‑the‑go or at work. The balance of our revenue was driven by tea accessories, 25%, and food and beverages, 9%. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our revenues by product category for each of the past three fiscal years as well as information about our geographic operating segments.
     We believe our business model is based on innovation, quality and the customer experience. These attributes have resulted in strong financial results, as evidenced by the following:
    
· | Thirty consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth through the end of Fiscal 2016.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our comparable store sales increased by 2.2% in Fiscal 2016, 6.6% in Fiscal 2015 and 11.1% in Fiscal 2014.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The growth of our store base from 70 stores in Fiscal 2011 to 231 stores in Fiscal 2016, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. As of January 28, 2017, we had a net total of 38 more stores than as at January 30, 2016.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An increase in sales from $41.9 million in Fiscal 2011 to $216.0 million in Fiscal 2016. Sales in Fiscal 2016 were approximately 19.5% higher than in Fiscal 2015.

 Our Market and Competition
     We participate in the large and growing global tea market which, combined with the relatively low percentage of tea sales in North America, make our market opportunity highly attractive.
     The Canadian and U.S. tea markets are highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of relatively small independently owned tea retailers and a number of regional and national tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and ready‑to‑drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers and Internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer teawares and related accessories. As we continue to expand geographically, we expect to encounter additional regional and local competitors. 
     We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our distinct retail experience, the broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products, the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing strategy, our versatile store economics and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members. 
     We believe that our brand, passion for tea and breadth of offering encourage our customers to view tea as fresh and fun. The clean, modern aesthetic of our retail concept communicates the newness and innovation behind our brand. The DAVIDsTEA retail experience is led by our Tea Guides, who share our knowledge of tea through a highly interactive and immersive customer experience of sampling and educating. They show our customers that tea is easy to prepare, comes in a variety of great flavors and is suitable for multiple occasions. It is this customer interaction combined with the high‑quality teas that has allowed us to develop strong customer loyalty. 
     We believe that our fresh approach to tea gives us a broad, multi‑generational appeal and, coupled with several key consumer trends such as health and wellness will help support our long‑term growth. We focus on constant innovation to improve the taste and presentation of our existing teas and tea blends while creating new offerings that delight our customers. We seek to develop creative tea-related gifts and accessories that are innovative and make steeping tea easy at home or on‑the‑go. We believe that our focus on innovation and design keeps existing customers engaged while also attracting new customers to our brand.
    
We believe our field‑based marketing and social media approach build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and our e-commerce site. One aspect of this effort is our events sponsorship group, which we believe is a differentiated capability that allows us to create excitement for our brand by engaging directly in the communities around our stores and drive store visits by offering product.
    
We believe there is an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our store base in North America. Our sales are currently substantially derived from sales in Canada, which accounted for 84%, 86%, and 91% of net sales in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. We generated 16%, 14%, and 9% of our net sales in the United States in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. 
    
We will continue to expand our customer base and build our brand visibility and awareness, in part, through further development of our omni-channel strategy in North America, with a focus on the alterantive sales channel. We believe that we have substantial room to grow our alternative sales channel, by offering our products to hotels, restaurants and institutions, office and workplace locations and food services, as well as through corporate gifting and other areas.
     Our Stores and Operations
 Our Stores
     As of January 28, 2017, our retail footprint consisted of 181 stores in Canada and 50 stores in the United States. Our retail stores are located primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. Each store exterior prominently displays the DAVIDsTEA teal signage. In Fiscal 2016, our average store was approximately 900 square feet. We have rapidly pursued new store growth, having significantly increased our store base from one store in Fiscal 2008 to 231 stores as of January 28, 2017. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our long-lived assets in Canada and the US.

 Distinctive Retail Experience
     The DAVIDsTEA experience starts with our people both in stores, our Tea Guides, and at our service support center. Our people’s knowledge and passion permeate our culture and are rooted in a deep knowledge of, and desire to share, the compelling attributes of tea. Our modern and simple-aesthetic stores, coupled with our teal‑colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. A key element of the retail experience is our “Tea Wall,” a focal point of the store, which displays approximately 150 premium teas and tea blends. Our Tea Guides help create a highly interactive and immersive customer experience and we strive to make tea a multi‑sensory experience. Indeed, they facilitate the interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. Every visit to our stores is designed to create a sense of adventure for our customers, from novice and experienced tea drinkers alike, as our knowledgeable, personable and passionate Tea Guides assist our customers in navigating the “Tea Wall” by selecting a variety of teas for customers to smell based on their taste preferences.      Site Selection and New Store Model
     We seek to open stores in strategic locations that support the brand image, targeting high customer traffic locations primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. We employ a rigorous analytical process to identify new store locations. For every store location selected, our real estate team prepares a detailed financial plan, which is evaluated by our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and members of our board. Our real estate team, led by our Head of Global Real Estate and Store Development, spends considerable time evaluating prospective sites. We also actively monitor and manage the performance of our stores and seek to incorporate information learned through the monitoring process into our analytic process and future site selection decisions.         Store Management, Culture and Training
     We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes customer service and the importance of delivering optimal performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams that meet our high performance standards. We use store-level scorecards that report key performance indicators. We provide our store managers with a number of analytical tools to support our store operations and assist them in attaining optimum store performance. These tools include key performance indicator reports, coaching logs for one‑on‑one meetings, weekly one‑on‑one meetings between our store managers and district managers and annual evaluations. While our focus is on the overall performance of the team and our stores, we provide incentives to team members, store managers and district managers.
     We have developed a distinctive culture that inspires in our team members a passion for tea. Our culture is also focused on customer service through comprehensive training, career development and individual enrichment. We believe our culture allows us to attract knowledgeable, passionate, fun and motivated team members who are driven to succeed.
    
· | Passion for Tea. We believe our passionate and fun Tea Guides are a major element of our retail experience. We seek to recruit, hire, train, retain and promote qualified, knowledgeable and enthusiastic team members who share our passion for tea and strive to deliver an extraordinary retail experience to our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Extensive Training. We have specific training and certification requirements for all new team members, including undergoing food handlers’ certification and fifteen hours of foundational training. This process helps ensure that all team members educate our customers and execute our standards accurately and consistently. As team members progress to the assistant manager and manager levels, they undergo additional weeks of training in sales, operations and management.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Career Development and Individual Enrichment. We track and reward team member performance, which we believe incentivizes excellence and helps us identify top performers and thus maintain a sufficient talent pool to support our growth. Many of our store managers and district managers are promoted from within our organization. We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams who meet our high performance standards.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our core values and distinctive corporate culture allow us to attract passionate and friendly employees who share a vision of making tea fun and accessible. We have a strong focus on community engagement, and our culture reflects our belief in doing right by our customers and our communities. We provide our employees with extensive training, career development, individual enrichment, and empowerment, which we believe is a key contributor for our success. In addition, the strength of our management team is supported by our dedicated board of directors that works closely with our executives in initiatives related to developing corporate

strategy, building our corporate culture and enhancing our sales and operations infrastructure. Our board of directors and management team’s experience is balanced between entrepreneurial growth and large-scale operations.
     Our Digital Platform
     Our digital platform is primarily comprised of our website, www.davidstea.com. We launched our website just prior to opening our first store. Our e‑commerce sales represented 10.6% of sales for Fiscal 2016, compared to 9.4% and 7.9% of sales for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. 
     Our website features our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food. To drive increased sales through our digital platform, we utilize online‑specific marketing and promotions. In addition, we employ banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay‑per‑click arrangements to help drive customer traffic to our website. 
     Through our e-commerce platform, we can target a broader audience of customers who may not live near one of our retail locations. We believe our digital platform and our stores are complementary, as our digital platform provides our store customers an additional channel through which to purchase our teas and tea‑related products while also helping drive awareness of and customer traffic to our stores.
     Our digital platform also includes our social media platform on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat and Yelp. We will continue to leverage our growing social media presence to increase our e‑commerce site sales and drive additional store visits within existing and new markets.
     Our Product Categories
     We offer approximately 150 premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food primarily through our retail stores and e-commerce site. Additionally, we offer on‑the‑go tea beverages in our retail stores.     Teas
     Our loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts that consumers can enjoy at home, on‑the‑go or at work, represented 66% of our sales in Fiscal 2016, 66% in Fiscal 2015 and 68% in Fiscal 2014. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu’erh, mate, rooibos and herbal tea. Furthermore, approximately 80% of our teas are blended with other ingredients while approximately 20% are straight teas. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including but not limited to, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka and South Africa. In addition to loose‑leaf teas, we sell pre‑packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient for some customers. Our tea-related gifts include special edition holiday gift packages.     Tea Accessories
     Our tea accessories, representing 25% of our sales in Fiscal 2016, 24% in Fiscal 2015 and 22% in Fiscal 2014, are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient and fun and easy at home or on-the-go for customers. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique features to improve tea preparation and consumption. Most of our accessories are crafted with unique colors and designs.     Food and Beverages
     Our retail stores offer tea beverages for on‑the‑go consumption and our retail stores and e-commerce site offer food products, which together represented 9% of our sales in Fiscal 2016 and 10% in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. Our beverages range from the standard hot or iced tea to our Tea Lattes.      Product Development and Design
     Our tea and merchandising teams travel throughout the world seeking premium teas and tea-related products. These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We are constantly exploring different ingredients, flavors and trends

that are popular in a variety of cultures from which we introduce new teas to our customers. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea, which we rotate into our product offering to attract new customers and keep current customers coming back. Our blending process is very focused on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as around seasonal holidays. We believe our focus on innovation and product development is a key differentiating factor for our brand that drives our customer’s loyalty.
     Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and easy at home or on-the-go. We have a competitive advantage in that our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in‑house. Therefore, we are better positioned to create unique and proprietary designs to make consuming loose‑leaf tea easier and more fun for our customers. We believe our combination of product selection and product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers.
     Marketing and Advertising
     We differentiate our business through a unique field‑based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and e‑commerce site in both new and existing markets. We customize our marketing mix for each of our markets and purposes through our events sponsorship group. Our events sponsorship group engages directly in the communities around our stores and drives store visits by offering product samplings and beverage coupons, and by participating in both hyper‑local and large‑scale events. These events are identified and coordinated by our local store managers and Tea Guides with support from our dedicated corporate events team.     Sourcing and Manufacturing
     We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. The majority of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. We have a flexible and scalable supply chain system. Most of our pre‑packaged teas are primarily assembled in our Montréal warehouse and then shipped to our retail stores. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are important as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. We have a process of quality control, which includes in-house testing and vendor testing. In addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors are important to the quality control process and ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines.      Warehouse and Distribution Facilities
     We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food to our stores and our e‑commerce customers from distribution centers in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Calgary, Alberta and Champlain, New York. In Canada, our third-party Sherbrooke warehouse ships to our Canadian e‑commerce customers and our Montreal warehouse ships to Eastern Canada stores, while our third‑party distribution centers in Calgary ships to Western Canada. Our Champlain, New York distribution center ships to all our U.S. stores and began shipping directly to our U.S. ecommerce customers during Fiscal 2015. We operate the distribution facility in Montréal, which is leased. Third parties operate the facilities in Calgary and Champlain, New York. Our products are typically shipped to our stores and our e‑commerce customers via a third‑party national transportation provider multiple times per week.     Management Information Systems
     Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our e‑commerce site on an independent platform. We believe our information systems provide us with enhanced operational efficiencies, scalability, increased management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to trends in our business. We utilize a combination of industry‑standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to:
· | point of sales;
--+----------------


· | inventory management;
--+----------------------


· | warehouse management, and;
--+---------------------------


· | accounting and financial reporting.

 Government Regulation
     We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.     Insurance
     We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including but not limited to a worker’s compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.      Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
     We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. We own several trademarks and servicemarks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA®. We have also registered our stylized logos. We also own domain names, including davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or made application to register one or more of our marks in a number of foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where registration has been sought.
     We also rely upon trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods including trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information.
     We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If a competitor infringes on our trademark rights, we may take action to protect our rights, which could result in litigation, in which case, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations.
     Employees
     As of the end of Fiscal 2016, we had 3,059 employees. As of January 28, 2017, we employed a total of 477 full‑time employees and 2,582 part‑time employees, with 470 in the United States and 2,589 in Canada. Of all those employees, 2,822 were employed in our retail channel and 237 were employed in corporate, distribution and direct channel support functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.     Seasonality
     Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the year-end holiday season. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the year-end holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the year-end holiday season, we must order and keep in inventory more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
