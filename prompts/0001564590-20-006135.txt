Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview 
 We believe the promise of Internet of Things (“IoT”) will be realized through the development of intelligent devices and systems that are cloud-enabled, contribute critical data, facilitate distributed control and decision making, and operate securely at scale. The opportunity to help companies transform their businesses and operations through these intelligent systems is enormous, and Bsquare offers a unique combination of expertise in device-level solutions, embedded operating systems, and IoT software and services. Since our founding in 1994, Bsquare has been at the intersection of hardware and software. Today that intersection is the “edge” where cloud-enabled devices connect to create intelligent systems that share data, facilitate distributed control and machine learning, and operate securely at scale. From device hardware, to the operating system, to IoT software solutions, and cloud services that make intelligent systems possible, Bsquare’s expertise, products and services are at the center of digital transformation.
 While 2019 was a year of transition for Bsquare, we expect 2020 to be a year of focus and discipline as we seek to accelerate the recovery we started in 2019. With an entrepreneurial leadership team in place we anticipate a return to revenue growth and predictability. In 2019 we established a foundation that will allow Bsquare to more readily take advantage of growth opportunities as they become apparent. 
 Our Partner Solutions business segment is a strong source of both cash and important partner and customer relationships. We are uniquely positioned as a software-only Microsoft distributor. Because we sell operating system (“OS”) software decoupled from hardware, we can partner with a wide range of customers, especially those who are concerned about procuring their software from a potential hardware competitor. Nearly every customer that has been buying OS software is now contemplating their IoT strategy and our longstanding relationship allows us to cross sell our Edge to Cloud products and services. 
 The distribution market is also changing dramatically. Our customers’ products, essentially hardware and associated software, cannot be sold, installed, and then forgotten. Today, our customers constantly seek to maintain and optimize the operating system, firmware, and software in their products. Further, these devices are increasingly becoming a part of complex networks, what is often referred to as IoT, and what we call intelligent systems. This evolution is creating new opportunities for our business. Our software and edge expertise combined with our position as a supply chain partner makes us uniquely suited to address these complex requirements. 
 In our Edge to Cloud business segment, we plan to expand on the valuable experience we gained serving our large customers in 2019 building and operating their IoT solutions at scale. Our B2IQ software and consulting suite and our improved engineering methodologies create a foundation upon which we can build and grow this business segment. We plan to continue to invest in creating an agile and quality-oriented customer service function that will become an integral part of our customers’ IoT operations, allowing our customers to rely on Bsquare to ensure that their products are well designed and can operate in a fully connected IoT-enabled world.
 In pursuing revenue growth in both segments, we seek to exploit what we believe to be the obvious synergy between our two core businesses.
 We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. Our website address is www.bsquare.com. Information contained on or that can be accessed through our website is not a part of this Form 10-K.
 Partner Solutions Business Segment
 Customers engage us because of our long history as a Microsoft OS distribution and technology partner and our industry leading technical expertise in OS image development, device software development and testing, and embedded and mobile operating systems design. We believe that engaging us on a new device design typically results in shorter development cycles and reduced time-to-market, lower overall costs to complete projects, and enhanced product robustness and features, which a customer may otherwise have been unable to achieve.
Market
 Our target market includes makers of connected, intelligent computing devices such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, smart vending machines, ATM machines, essential equipment in buildings and facilities environments, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. These devices utilize various operating system software including Microsoft Windows IoT, Android, Linux, or QNX, and are typically connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers, for these smart devices, include world-class original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), corporate enterprises (“Enterprises”), silicon vendors (“SVs”) and peripheral vendors.

Competition 
 Our competitors in the Edge to Cloud segment, or companies against which we anticipate vying for opportunities, include:
  
• | Large, established enterprise software and solution providers such as IBM, SAS, Oracle and SAP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cloud IoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC ThingWorx; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3IOT and others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The market for device software and engineering services is competitive. We face competition from the following:

 Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. They may also focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our services and software solutions, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with AWS or Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.

Neither AWS nor Microsoft has agreed to an exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete against us. Amazon may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring in-house more of the core-embedded development services and expertise that we currently provide, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is relatively low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows operating system software and services, including in the evolving IoT market. These systems integrators may be given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We market our products and professional engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, digital marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
International Operations 
 Our international operations outside of North America are conducted through our offices in Trowbridge, England. In the fourth quarter of 2019 we made the decision to close our operation in Taipei, Taiwan. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows IoT operating systems was previously restricted to North America, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. Revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was approximately 15% and 6% of total revenue in 2019 and 2018 respectively. Our distribution rights for Microsoft Windows IoT products in the E.U., the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa expired on June 30, 2019.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information regarding our international operations. 
 Personnel 
 We had total headcount of 75 at December 31, 2019; including 48 located in North America, 26 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Taiwan. As conditions necessitate, professional engineering service employees may perform research and development activities and vice versa. 
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 We strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements. While we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us, we plan to continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
 Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. 
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. 
 Available Information 
 We electronically file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We make available on our website at www.bsquare.com, free of charge, copies of these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with, or furnishing them to the SEC.
