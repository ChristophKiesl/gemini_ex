Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are an independent provider of hydraulic fracturing and wireline services and related goods to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in North America. We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the “DJ Basin”), the Williston Basin, the San Juan Basin and the Powder River Basin. Following the completion of the OneStim Acquisition (as defined below) we now also provide services in the Haynesville Shale, the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province and Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher (collectively the “SCOOP/STACK”), the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a pressurized stream of fracturing fluid—typically a mixture of water, chemicals and proppant—into a well casing or tubing in order to cause the underground formation to fracture or crack. These fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and provide a conductive channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. The propping agent, or proppant,—typically sand—becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the well. The fracturing fluid is engineered to lose viscosity, or “break,” and is subsequently flowed back from the formation, leaving the proppant suspended in the formation fractures. Once our customer has flushed the fracturing fluids from the well using a controlled flow-back process, the customer manages fluid and water recycling or disposal.
Our hydraulic fracturing fleets consist of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of high-pressure hydraulic pumps, engines, transmissions, radiators and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted on trailers. We refer to the group of units and other equipment, such as blenders, data vans, sand storage, tractors, manifolds and high pressure fracturing iron, which are necessary to perform a typical hydraulic fracturing job, as a “fleet,” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew,” the size of each fleet and crew can vary depending on the requirements of each job design. 
We have wireline operations after December 31, 2020 as a result of the OneStim Acquisition (as defined below). Our wireline units consist of a truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is lowered into wells to convey specialized tools or equipment necessary to connect the wellbore with the target formation. This operation is performed between each hydraulic fracturing stage. We offer our wireline service on a stand alone basis or alongside our hydraulic fracturing services. When offered along side our hydraulic fracturing services, we are able to maximize efficiency for our customers through optimized coordination of the wireline and hydraulic fracturing services.
Our operations are organized into a single business segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing services, including wireline, and goods, including our Permian sand mines, and we have one reportable geographical segment, North America. We have grown from one active hydraulic fracturing fleet in December 2011 to approximately 30 fleets in the first quarter of 2021, including the addition of active fleets as a result of the OneStim Acquisition (as defined below).
Our founders and existing management were pioneers in the development of data-driven hydraulic fracturing technologies for application in shale plays. Prior to founding the Company, the majority of our management team founded and built Pinnacle Technologies, Inc. (“Pinnacle Technologies”) into a leading fracturing technology company. In 1992, Pinnacle Technologies developed the first commercial hydraulic fracture mapping technologies, analytical tools that played a major role in launching the shale revolution. Our extensive experience with fracture technologies and customized fracture design has enabled us to develop new technologies and processes that provide our customers with real time solutions that significantly enhance their completions. These technologies include hydraulic fracture propagation models, reservoir engineering tools, large, proprietary shale production databases and multi-variable statistical analysis techniques. Taken together, these technologies have enabled us to be a leader in hydraulic fracture design innovation and application.
We believe the following characteristics distinguish us from our competitors and are the foundations of our business: forming ongoing partnerships of trust and innovation with our customers; developing and utilizing technology to maximize well performance; and promoting a people-centered culture focused on our employees, customers and suppliers. We have developed strong relationships with our customers by investing significant time in fracture design collaboration, which substantially 
enhances their production economics. Our technological innovations have become even more critical as E&P companies have increased the completion complexity and fracture intensity of horizontal wells. We are proactive in developing innovative solutions to industry challenges, including developing: (i) our databases of U.S. unconventional wells to which we apply our proprietary multi-variable statistical analysis technologies to provide differential insight into fracture design optimization; (ii) our Liberty Quiet Fleet® design which significantly reduces noise levels compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing fleets; (iii) hydraulic fracturing fluid systems tailored to the specific reservoir properties in the basins in which we operate; and (iv) our dual fuel dynamic gas blending fleets that allow our engines to run diesel or a combination of diesel and natural gas, to optimize fuel use, reduce emissions and lower costs. We foster a people-centered culture built around honoring our commitments to customers, partnering with our suppliers and hiring, training and retaining people that we believe to be the best talent in our field, enabling us to be one of the safest and most efficient hydraulic fracturing companies in North America.
Recent Developments
On December 31, 2020, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Schlumberger Limited’s (“Schlumberger”) OneStim® business, which provides hydraulic fracturing pressure pumping services in onshore United States and Canada, including its pressure pumping, pumpdown perforating and Permian frac sand business (such entire business of Schlumberger, “OneStim,” and the portion of OneStim acquired pursuant by the Company, the “Transferred Business”) in exchange for consideration resulting in a total of 66,326,134 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Common Stock”) being issued in connection with the transaction (such transaction, the “OneStim Acquisition”; see Note 3—The OneStim Acquisition to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). Effective December 31, 2020, Schlumberger owned 37% of the issued and outstanding shares of our combined Class A Common Stock and our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”). 
The OneStim Acquisition substantially increased the Company’s geographical reach and expanded operations, allowing the Company to serve a broader range of customers and utilize the increase in scale, vertical integration and technological know-how to better serve new and existing customers. The Transferred Business includes over 500 fully operational hydraulic fracturing pumps, district facilities, pumpdown perforating wireline units, two state-of-the-art sand mines in the Permian Basin and a highly experienced team of employees. Additionally, the Company added over 400 owned and licensed patents, significant internally developed software intellectual property and a strategic alliance agreement, which increases access to technology portfolios and advances the technological collaborations we are able to offer our customers. The combined company offers best-in-class completion services for the sustainable development of unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada onshore markets.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations, such as those experienced in 2020. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies of hydrocarbons and reduced prices which in turn tend to drive a future reduction in E&P companies capital expenditures and reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies relating to holiday seasons, inclement weather and the conclusion of our customers’ annual drilling and completion capital expenditure budgets. Our most notable declines typically occur in the fourth quarter of the year for the reasons described above. Additionally, some of the areas in which we have operations, including Canada, the DJ Basin, Powder River Basin and Williston Basin, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice, rain, or frost, and related road restrictions, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Additionally, extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers’ ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water.
Intellectual Property
Over the last several years and in connection with the OneStim Acquisition, we have significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities. Our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings, increase completion efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers.
We seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights when warranted. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely, to a great extent, on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,946 employees and no unionized labor. We believe we have good relations with our employees. We promote a people-centered culture focused heavily on our employees and believe that the strength of our workforce is critical to our success as a company. We consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs in order to attract and retain top talent in our industry. We generally strive to hire people with integrity, a positive attitude and hunger to learn and contribute to a team. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our headcount and implemented a company-wide employee furlough plan in order to align with the uncertain level of frac demand we experienced during the second and third quarters of 2020. As of September 30, 2020, all furloughed employees had returned from furlough. We have implemented and continue to implement safety measures in all of our facilities to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, as a result of the OneStim Acquisition, we expect to hire approximately 800 employees following a brief transition period during which their continuing service is provided while on secondment from Schlumberger.
Health and Safety
Our people are our most important asset and ensuring their safety and the safety of those around them is the most important thing we do. Making certain that the Liberty team is well trained to handle the complexities of daily field operations, and that their training and competency remains current with the latest technology and standards is a key component. In order to facilitate this training, we have developed the Liberty Frac Academy, a thorough program where employees are trained on various aspects of the Company, from safety in equipment operation to leadership skills. The Liberty Frac Academy not only ensures dissemination of high-quality training material, but also provides a forum for sharing best practices and lessons learned across the Company.
Programs and Benefits
One way we have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce is by offering competitive salaries and wages. To foster a strong sense of ownership, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive employees under our stock incentive program. Furthermore, we offer innovative benefits to all eligible employees, including, among others, comprehensive health insurance coverage, parental leave to all new parents, for birth or adoption, financial support for child adoption, leave to care for partners with serious health conditions, 401(k) savings plan and educational tuition assistance for both bachelor’s degree and master’s degree programs. We are also passionate about community investment and, in 2019, we joined the Ban the Box initiative which provides work opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals.

We also lease several smaller facilities, which leases generally have terms of one to six years. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our operations and their locations allow us to efficiently serve our customers. We do not believe that any single facility is material to our operations and, if necessary, we could readily obtain a replacement facility.
Marketing and Customers
Our sales and marketing activities typically are performed through our local sales representatives in each geographic region, and are supported by our corporate headquarters. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 48%, 35% and 42% of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, PDC Energy Inc., ConocoPhillips Company, Parsley Energy Operations, LLC, and WPX Energy each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our revenues.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We have a dedicated supply chain team that manages sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of supply in a cost effective manner across our areas of operation. We have built long-term relationships with multiple industry leading suppliers of proppant, chemicals and hydraulic fracturing equipment and have started to internally design and assemble key pump and maintenance parts. In addition, we have built a strong relationship with the assembler of our custom-designed hydraulic fracturing fleets and believe we will continue to have timely access to new, high capability fleets as we continue to grow. In 2018, we also vertically integrated a supplier of certain major components through the acquisition of ST9 Gas and Oil LLC.
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. The OneStim Acquisition included two state-of-the-art sand mines in the Permian Basin, which further alleviates the risk of potential future material supply shortages.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States and Canada, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest integrated service companies. Our hydraulic fracturing services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company as well as other companies including Calfrac Well Services Ltd., FTS International, Inc., NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Universal Pressure Pumping, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., STEP Energy Services and U.S. Well Services, Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Governmental Regulation
As a company with operations in both the United States and Canada, we are subject to the laws of both jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among those jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. We are also subject to numerous environmental and regulatory requirements related to our operations. For further information related to such regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
