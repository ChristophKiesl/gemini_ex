ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Our Company
We own, operate and franchise the restaurant brand Pollo Tropical®, which has nearly 35 years of operating history and a loyal customer base. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature fire-grilled and crispy citrus marinated chicken and other freshly prepared menu items. We believe the brand offers a distinct and unique flavor with broad appeal at a compelling value, which differentiates it in the competitive fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments. All but one of our restaurants offer the convenience of drive-thru windows.
For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, average annual sales per restaurant was approximately $2.8 million for our Pollo Tropical restaurants. As of January 1, 2023, we owned and operated 137 Pollo Tropical restaurants, all of which are located in Florida. We franchise our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily in international markets and, as of January 1, 2023, had 23 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants outside the contiguous United States. In addition, as of January 1, 2023, we had six domestic non-traditional Pollo Tropical licensed locations on college campuses in Florida and locations at a hospital and two sports and entertainment stadiums in Florida. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, we generated revenues of $387.4 million, and comparable restaurant sales increased 9.1% for Pollo Tropical.
Sale of Taco Cabana
On July 1, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement for the sale of all outstanding capital stock of Taco Cabana, Inc., the parent company of the Taco Cabana business (together with its subsidiaries, "Taco Cabana"), for a cash purchase price of $85.0 million, subject to reduction for (i) closing adjustments of approximately $4.6 million related to maintenance and repair work at the Taco Cabana restaurants and landscaping replacement as a result of Winter Storm Uri, and (ii) certain other working capital adjustments as set forth in the stock purchase agreement (the "Taco Cabana Divestiture"). The transaction was completed August 16, 2021, and the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Taco Cabana of $25.0 million during the year ended January 2, 2022, which is included within income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally in 2021, we filed an insurance claim for winter storm damages in Texas that occurred in the first quarter of 2021 and retained the right to receive the insurance claim proceeds. We recognized $0.9 million of insurance proceeds within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the year ended January 2, 2022 based on a partial settlement reached with certain insurers. We recognized an additional $1.0 million of insurance proceeds within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the year ended January 1, 2023. See Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Proceeds from the sale were used to fully repay Fiesta's approximately $74.6 million of outstanding term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility and to pay divestiture transaction fees and a loan prepayment premium totaling approximately $4.2 million, comprised of a loan prepayment fee of 3.0% of the principal repaid of $2.2 million and divestiture transaction fees of approximately $2.0 million.
All revenues, costs and expenses and income taxes attributable to Taco Cabana, together with the gain on the sale of Taco Cabana and certain costs related to the transaction, have been aggregated within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. No amounts for shared general and administrative operating support expense were allocated to discontinued operations. Interest expenses, the amortization of premiums and debt issuance costs of our new and former senior credit facilities and the loss on extinguishment of debt under our new and former senior credit facilities are included within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for the years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021. 
Labor Challenges and Inflationary Factors
Throughout much of 2022, labor supply shortages impacted the entire restaurant industry as well as our operations. Hours of operations were limited across multiple channels due to labor shortages. In response to this challenge, we increased recruiting resources and offered additional payment incentives at the most affected locations as well as new hire sign-on bonuses. In addition, we benchmark our operations team wage rates and benefits on an ongoing basis to ensure our total compensation is market-competitive and the 2022 and 2023 hourly wage rates are above the required minimum levels for the State of Florida. As a result of our efforts and as overall labor supply improved, our staffing levels improved and stabilized during the second half of 2022 which enabled an increase in operating hours across all channels. Overall staffing levels at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 recovered to the approximate staffing levels experienced in the first half of 2021 prior to the labor supply issues, although a small number of select locations continue to experience labor shortages. As a result of the improved staffing levels, the payment incentives are targeted to be phased out in the first quarter of 2023.
Inflationary factors have been experienced primarily in food costs and other operating costs categories. Commodity costs as a percentage of net sales increased 4.9% in the year ended January 1, 2023 compared to the year ended January 2, 2022. Utilities costs as a percentage of net sales also increased 0.4% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher energy prices in 2022.
Pricing action has been taken to offset labor, food and other operating cost increases. In order to maintain value perceptions with our customers, we implemented a phased approach to menu price increases and took lower pricing increases on items purchased by value-conscious customers including our "Pollo Time" promotional items. Price increases include a 5.0% increase in March 2022, a 1.4% increase in June 2022, and a 4.0% increase in September 2022. As a result of this phased approach to menu price increases, margin improvement is trailing the impact of cost increases noted above, with improved margins expected in future quarters compared to the year ended January 1, 2023, barring unforeseen changes in our cost structure and operating environment. 
Our Brand 
Our restaurants operate in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and feature fresh-made cooking, drive-thru service and catering.
Pollo Tropical. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature fresh chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of tropical fruit juices and spices, crispy or fire-grilled, boneless and bone-in. Our menu's emphasis is on freshness and quality. Other fan-favorite menu items include TropiChops® (a create your own bowl of fire-grilled chicken, crispy chicken, mojo roast pork or churrasco, served over white, brown or yellow rice, and topped with a choice of black beans, tomatoes, kernel corn, peppers and sautéed onions), as well as platters, sandwiches, wraps and salads. Side dishes include rice, beans, corn, plantains and fried yuca. We also offer a wide selection of signature sauces which allow our guests to further customize their orders. Dessert offerings include flan, cuatro leches and key lime pie, as well as limited-time seasonal items, and beverages include fountain drinks, lemonade, flavored brewed teas, as well as frozen Tropichillers®. Most menu items are prepared daily in each of our restaurants, which feature open display cooking on large, open-flame grills. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests and catering for parties and corporate events. We began selling proprietary alcoholic beverages including wine and beer at most Pollo Tropical locations in 2020 to increase off-premise sales. 
Our Pollo Tropical restaurant dining areas are designed to create an inviting, festive and tropical atmosphere. We also provide our guests the option of take-out, including the ability to order online in advance, and all but one of our restaurants provide the convenience of drive-thru windows. Delivery is available through third-party partnerships at all Pollo Tropical locations. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants are generally open for lunch, dinner, and late night seven days a week. As of January 1, 2023, substantially all of our Pollo Tropical restaurants were freestanding buildings. Our typical freestanding Pollo Tropical restaurant ranges from 2,800 to 3,700 square feet and provides interior seating for approximately 70 to 90 guests. During the year ended January 1, 2023, the majority of our sales were through drive-thru windows, take-out, or delivery. For the year ended January 1, 2023, the average sales transaction at our Pollo Tropical restaurants was $16.64, with sales at dinner/late night and lunch representing 49.3% and 50.7%, respectively. For the year ended January 1, 2023, our Pollo Tropical brand generated total revenues of $387.4 million and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $21.8 million.
Pollo Tropical opened its first restaurant in 1988 in Miami, Florida. As of January 1, 2023, we owned and operated a total of 137 Pollo Tropical restaurants, all located in Florida.
We are franchising and licensing our Pollo Tropical restaurants internationally and in non-traditional domestic locations. As of January 1, 2023, we had 23 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants located in Puerto Rico, Panama, Guyana, Ecuador, and the Bahamas, six non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses in Florida, and locations at a hospital and two sports and entertainment stadiums in Florida. We have agreements for the continued development of franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in certain of our existing franchised markets.
Taco Cabana. Prior to our sale of Taco Cabana, our Taco Cabana restaurants served fresh, Mexican-inspired food. Typical freestanding Taco Cabana restaurants averaged approximately 3,500 square feet (exclusive of the exterior dining area) and provided seating for approximately 80 guests, with additional outside patio seating for approximately 50 guests. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe our competitive strengths include the following key attributes: 
Well Positioned and Differentiated in the Fast-Casual and Quick-Service Segments. As of January 1, 2023, we owned, operated and franchised 169 fast-casual restaurants under our Pollo Tropical brand which has nearly 35 years of operating history. We believe Pollo Tropical has compelling average annual sales per restaurant within the fast-casual and quick-service segments at $2.8 million for 2022, and we believe it is well positioned in the industry due to our high quality, freshly-prepared food, value and differentiation of flavor profiles. 
Leading, Differentiated Brand Serving Freshly Prepared, High Quality Foods with Broad Appeal and a Compelling Value Proposition. Our Pollo Tropical brand is differentiated from other dining options and offers distinct flavor profiles and healthy menu choices at affordable prices that we believe has broad consumer appeal, provides guests with a compelling value proposition, attracts a diverse customer base and drives guest frequency and loyalty. Pollo Tropical is committed to serving freshly-prepared food using quality ingredients that are made-to-order and customized for each guest. Pollo Tropical offers a wide range of menu offerings and home meal replacement options in generous portion sizes and at affordable price points which appeal to a broad customer base. Our open display kitchen format allows guests to view and experience our food being freshly-prepared and cooked to order. We continue to refine our menus, including some seasonal offerings at our restaurants, in order to provide variety to our guests, address changes in consumer preferences, and maintain a speed of service that appeals to our customers. We also selectively use promotions and limited time offers which are intended to reinforce our value proposition and to introduce new products. Additionally, we offer our guests the convenience of drive-thru service, online ordering, curbside pickup, and delivery through third-party delivery services in order to provide a viable option for home meal replacement and family meals.
Compelling Business Model. We enjoy significant brand recognition due to high market penetration of our restaurants in our core markets which provides operating, marketing and distribution efficiencies and convenience for our guests. Pollo Tropical has a strong brand affinity in our core markets as evidenced by fast-casual and quick-service segment-leading average annual sales volumes, as noted above. 
Growth Strategies 
Our long-term strategy is focused on profitably building our base business, growing new distribution channels, including catering, delivery, licensed and franchised locations, and development of new restaurants.
Our strategies for growth primarily include: 
Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales. Comparable restaurant sales increased 9.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. We also experienced an increase in comparable restaurant sales in 2021 of 16.0%, which we believe was attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and labor challenges in 2020. These challenges continued into 2021 and, to a lesser extent, into 2022. We believe our significant mix of dine-in sales prior to the pandemic had a negative impact on comparable restaurant sales. We are focused on increasing comparable restaurant sales in the future by attracting new customers and increasing guest frequency through the following strategies:
•Focus on consistency of operations and food quality: We believe high quality food and hospitality, a comfortable ambience, and reasonable prices result in an enjoyable guest experience, which drives loyalty and guest frequency. We improved our operations training, systems, processes and equipment in 2022 and will continue to focus on improving operations training, systems and processes to ensure consistency of operations and improvements in execution. In addition, supply chain and food preparation processes have been implemented to ensure high quality, freshness and consistency of our food, which we believe are critical components to the continued success of our brand.
•Grow our off-premise sales with focus on digital platform: The inclusion of portable menu items, such as wraps, sandwiches, bowls and salads, as well as family meals, and an increased focus on catering and delivery will continue to be a key focus for Pollo Tropical as we look to capture more off-premise meal occasions which we believe may be significant. Off-premise meal consumption increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe that off-premise sales may continue to be significant. In 2020, we expanded our third-party delivery partnerships to include delivery through multiple delivery service providers. We engaged a third party to improve our mobile apps and enhance our digital connections and interactions to grow our digital business and create experiences that minimize friction within our digital platforms including creating a state-of-the-art mobile app. We also implemented curbside pickup functionality as an option with online ordering and began improving connectivity at our restaurants, upgrading portable tablets and enabling touchless payments. In 2021, we invested in improving our digital platform and improving the speed and ease of use for off-premise sales channels including an enhanced drive-thru experience, 
geofencing technology for curbside orders and infrastructure changes to improve the speed of order cycle time for drive-thru and delivery orders in the second half of 2021. In 2021, we also completed design and began the implementation of digital drive-thru technology, which is designed to grow traffic and drive-thru check averages by improving speed of service at peak times, increasing promotion visibility and upselling opportunities and increasing order accuracy. In 2022, rolled out curbside capabilities to substantially all locations. Additionally, we implemented our digital drive-thru technology at 10 locations and introduced QR "Kiosk in Hand" technology for ordering and payment for our counter guests.
•New product innovation: Our menu is centered on freshly prepared, quality food offerings that we believe have both broad appeal and provide everyday value. Pollo Tropical has a team of product research and development professionals that enables us to continually refine our menu offerings and develop new products, several of which are validated by consumer research. Maintaining a strong product pipeline is critical to keeping our offerings compelling, and we intend to introduce innovative new menu items and enhancements to existing menu favorites throughout the year to drive further guest traffic, maximize guest frequency, and increase average check. 
•Focus on effective advertising to highlight our everyday value proposition: Pollo Tropical utilizes an integrated, multi-level marketing approach that includes periodic system-wide promotions, outdoor marketing including billboards, in-restaurant promotions, local trade area marketing, social media, digital and web-based marketing and other strategies, including the use of radio and television advertising and limited-time offer menu item and value promotions. In addition, we have email and app-based loyalty programs at Pollo Tropical (My Pollo™) to further connect with our guests to build affinity and frequency. In 2020, we introduced a new state-of-the-art mobile app for Pollo Tropical. As a percentage of Pollo Tropical restaurant sales, Pollo Tropical's advertising expenditures were 3.3% in 2022, 3.2% in 2021 and 2.7% in 2020.
•Continue our reimage program: We believe ensuring a high-quality restaurant environment that complements our quality focus on food and hospitality will further drive incremental sales and profitability. We continue to implement restaurant enhancement initiatives to ensure safe, consistent and appealing experiences at our Pollo Tropical restaurants. During 2021, we developed an updated and more efficient restaurant design that reflects evolving post-COVID consumer behavior as well as consumer research. During 2021 and 2022, we began testing the new design in remodels and refreshes. We completed 32 refreshes and remodels through the end of 2022. We continued to enhance the new design in additional remodels and refreshes in 2022 and will continue to do so in ongoing refreshes and remodels in 2023. 
Non-Traditional License and International Franchise Development. We generally update our Pollo Tropical franchise disclosure documents each year to support potential franchise growth in the future. We are currently primarily focused on growing non-traditional domestic licensed locations on university campuses and non-traditional licensed locations in airports, events stadiums and highway rest stops, while modestly growing international locations with quality operators. In 2021, we opened our first licensed sports and entertainment location in a professional football stadium in Florida and expanded that footprint in 2022 to an additional sports and entertainment venue.
Improve Profitability and Optimize Our Infrastructure. We believe that our large restaurant base, skilled management team, operating systems, technology initiatives and training and development programs support our strategy of enhancing operating efficiencies while prudently growing our restaurant base. We continue to focus on maximizing cost efficiencies, including, among other things, implementing profit enhancement initiatives focused on food and labor costs, leveraging our purchasing power and enhancing our supply chain to optimize costs while delivering a high-quality guest experience with consistency. Our restaurant-level profitability at Pollo Tropical is very competitive within the restaurant industry segments in which we compete. 
Develop New Restaurants. We believe that we have opportunities to develop additional Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida, as well as potential future domestic expansion opportunities that match our site selection criteria. We paused our new restaurant development plans in 2020 through 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages. We intend to resume new restaurant development in the future and are currently qualifying sites in Florida for potential new units and are targeting a recommencement of restaurant openings in 2024, although there is no assurance that we will open any new restaurants in 2024. The development of new restaurants will incorporate what we have learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and our reimaging market research, both qualitative and quantitative. During 2021, we retained third-party consultants to assist in creating a new store design with a lower investment, optimized productivity and updated design features that we believe better match evolving consumer preferences. We began testing and refining the new design in remodels and refreshes in 2021 and continued these tests with additional remodels and refreshes in 2022, with even more expected in 2023. 
We target opening freestanding restaurants in order to provide drive-thru service which is an important convenience and sales component for our brand. The location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management team determines the acceptability of all new sites based upon site visits, analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals, and third-party proprietary location research and analysis. Historically, this process has typically resulted in entering into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building or the conversion of an existing building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility. While we have not yet entered into new unit lease agreements, we continue to evaluate opportunities for potential new sites.
The cost to construct a new or converted free-standing restaurant for our new restaurant design is estimated to be between $1.6 million and $2.0 million. 
The cost of building and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions, geographic considerations, the size of the restaurant, the characteristics of a particular site, and whether we are constructing a new building or converting an existing building. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from these estimates. 
Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with many national and regional quick service, fast casual, and in some cases casual dining restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants. We also compete with delivered meal solutions, convenience stores, grocery stores and other restaurant retailers.
We believe that:
•Product quality and taste; 
•Brand differentiation and recognition; 
•Convenience of location; 
•Comprehensive digital platform;
•Speed of service; 
•Menu variety; 
•Value perception; 
•Ambience; 
•Cleanliness; and
•Hospitality
are among the most important competitive factors in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and that Pollo Tropical effectively competes against those categories. Pollo Tropical's competitors include national and regional chicken-based concepts, as well as other concepts.

For comparative purposes, the calculation of average annual sales per company-owned restaurant is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Restaurant sales data for the extra week in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 have been excluded for purposes of calculating average annual sales per company-owned restaurant.
Seasonality 
Our business is marginally seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Sales from our restaurants located in South Florida are generally higher during the winter months than during the summer months, while sales from our restaurants located in Central Florida and North Florida are generally higher during the summer months than the winter months. In addition, we have outdoor seating at many of our restaurants and the effects of adverse weather may impact the use of these areas and may negatively impact our restaurant sales.
Operations
Management Information Systems 
Our management information systems provide us the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. 
In all corporate-owned restaurants, we use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support potential future growth plans. We use touch-screen point-of-sale (POS) systems, both fixed and mobile, designed specifically for the restaurant industry that facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking, are user-friendly, require limited cashier training, improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques, and provide appropriate audit trails. We use credit card processing devices which utilize industry-leading Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) that protect our customers' credit card data. The POS systems are integrated with above-store enterprise applications that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. All products sold and related prices at our restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office.
We provide in-store access to enterprise systems that assist in labor scheduling and food cost management, allow online ordering from distributors, and reduce managers' administrative time. Critical information from such systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information from all restaurants under their control and have access to key operating data on a remote basis. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize key restaurant performance indicators to manage our business.
These enterprise systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs, and other key operating information for each restaurant. These systems also provide the ability to monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant and provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide range of financial, product mix and operational data.
Our above-store digital ordering system is integrated with our POS system at each restaurant. Individual, group or catering orders placed on our website or that of our third-party delivery partners, mobile app or through our call center are transmitted electronically to the restaurants to provide a seamless ordering, payment and pickup or delivery experience for our guests. For mobile online ordering, we utilize a customized, proprietary consumer-facing mobile smartphone app developed in partnership with a leading third-party app developer. 
In 2022, we made a number of improvements to our digital platform, including the following:
•Continued to deploy a curbside delivery program to help alleviate congestion at the drive-thru and in dining rooms;
•Continued the implementation of digital drive-thru technology, which is expected to grow traffic and drive-thru check averages by improving speed of service at peak times, increase promotion visibility and upselling opportunities and increase order accuracy; and
•Continued Pollo Tropical app enhancements to improve ease-of-use and maximize revenue per online transactions.
In order to maintain security and compliance, we utilize an Advanced Endpoint Protection service and conduct ongoing cybersecurity training and a mock ethical phishing campaign. We also upgraded older restaurant operating systems across a number of endpoints.
We expect to continue making significant investments in technology that we believe will drive sales, improve margins or upgrade infrastructure. In 2023, we intend to focus technology investments on the ongoing rollout of our digital drive-thru platform, enhancements to our loyalty platform including a higher level of loyalty integration and friction reduction across all channels, and continuing to proactively update infrastructure elements in the technology platform that are nearing end of life. 
Community Social Impact 
We are committed to being a deeply responsible company in the communities where we do business. Our focus is on serving high quality food to our guests and contributing positively to the communities where our restaurants are located. This is integral to our business strategy. Our initiatives include:
•Our chicken is free of hormones and trans-fats and our shrimp is Best Aquaculture certified;
•Our chicken is sourced from suppliers dedicated to uphold responsible animal welfare practices;
•We continue to pursue finding more earth-friendly serving and packaging materials for our products including bags that are made from recycled material, are 100% recyclable and reusable and are Rainforest Alliance certified, paper drink cups that are Sustainable Forest Initiative certified and aluminum that contains postindustrial re-processed and post-consumer material;
•Military veterans are actively recruited to work at our restaurants;
•We have military appreciation days and we provide discounts to military and first responders;
•We assist, through our non-profit Fiesta Family Foundation, many of our employees who have personally suffered losses or other hardships;
•We strive to provide aid to those in need in our communities on an ongoing basis and during times of crisis. Specific examples of our efforts to aid the community include the following:
◦During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pollo Tropical provided approximately 113,000 free meals to school-aged children and approximately 22,000 free meals to first responders and healthcare professionals. Pollo Tropical also donated approximately $60 thousand in food donations to Miami Rescue Mission; and 
◦Immediately following the collapse of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida in 2021, Pollo Tropical was the first food provider on-site, distributing dinner to rescue workers the first night and continuing to deliver food on a weekly basis throughout the cleanup efforts. In addition to providing approximately 2,500 free meals to the rescue workers at the collapse site and to the Family Assistance Center at a nearby hotel, we also provided gift cards to displaced families from a nearby low-income condo building which was evacuated and shut down as a result of a safety audit immediately after the collapse.
•In 2022, we provided monetary and food donations or volunteered to various organizations including: World Central Kitchen, Miami Rescue Mission, Miami Dolphins Foundation, Miami Heat Charitable Fund, Fire and Police departments, The BBB Foundation (Bam Adebayo charitable organization), Easter Seals of South Florida, 305 Pink 
Pack, Homestead Air Force Base, Parkland Buddies, Broward County PBA, The Bill Tome Foundation, and the Florida Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
•In 2021, we provided monetary and food donations or volunteered to the following organizations: Fire and Police departments, Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters, Baptist Hospital - Miami, Lotus House, Miami-Dade Firefighters Benevolent Association, Miami Dolphins Foundation, Miami Heat Charitable Fund, Miami Rescue Mission, the Motivational Edge, and Victim Service Center - Orlando.
•In 2020, we provided monetary and food donations or volunteered to the following organizations: Fire and Police departments, hospitals and COVID testing and vaccination sites throughout Florida, Big Brother Helping Hand, Farm Workers Association, Kidz Nation, L.O.V.E Our Youth Orlando, Miami Rescue Mission, Ronald McDonald House, Salvation Army, SOS Kids - Coconut Creek, St. Jude's Shelter, Star of Hope, United Way, YMCA, and Zebra Coalition.
As a result of these initiatives, we believe we deliver benefits to our stakeholders, including employees, business partners, customers, suppliers, stockholders, community members, and others. 
Suppliers and Distributors 
We have negotiated directly with local and national suppliers for the purchase of food and beverage products and supplies to ensure consistent quality and freshness and to obtain competitive prices. Supply contracts are negotiated on an annual basis in some cases to obtain favorable pricing and ensure consistent supply flow. Food and supplies are ordered from approved suppliers and are shipped to the restaurants via distributors. We are responsible for monitoring quality control, for the supervision of these suppliers and for conducting inspections to observe preparations and ensure the quality of products purchased.
We have service agreements with our primary distributors of food and paper products. Performance Food Group, Inc., is our primary distributor of food and beverage products and supplies for our Pollo Tropical restaurants under a distribution services agreement that expires on July 27, 2024. We also currently rely on three suppliers for chicken for our Pollo Tropical restaurants under agreements that expire on December 31, 2023.
Quality Assurance 
Pollo Tropical is committed to obtaining quality ingredients and creating freshly-prepared food in a safe manner. In addition to operating in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations regarding minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness, among other things, we have also developed our own internal quality control standards. We require our suppliers to adhere to our high quality control standards, and we regularly inspect their products and production and distribution facilities to ensure that they conform to those standards. We have also implemented certain procedures to ensure that we serve safe, quality meals to our guests. As an example, we utilize the nationally-recognized ServSafe program to train our kitchen staff and managers on proper food handling and preparation techniques. Additionally, we have hired a third-party specialized service provider that conducts unscheduled food safety inspections of our restaurants, and restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. These third-party inspections are one of the metrics used in our restaurant-level incentive bonus programs.
In addition to food safety, our operational focus is closely monitored to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction via speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with our operating policies. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the restaurants and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute to our restaurant operations management team detailed reports measuring compliance with various guest service standards and objectives, including feedback obtained directly from our guests. The guest feedback is monitored by an independent agency and by us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have in-house guest service representatives that manage guest feedback and inquiries.
Trademarks 
We believe that our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos and other proprietary intellectual property are important to our success. We have registered the principal Pollo Tropical logos and designs with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register as a service mark for our restaurant services. We also have secured or have applied for state and federal registrations for several other advertising or promotional marks, including variations of the Pollo Tropical principal marks as 
well as those related to our core menu offerings. In connection with our current and potential international franchising activities, we have applied for or been granted registrations in foreign countries of the Pollo Tropical principal marks and several other marks. 
Other than the Pollo Tropical trademarks and the logo and trademark of Fiesta Restaurant Group (including internet domain names and addresses) and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings, we have no proprietary intellectual property. 
Continued Commitment to Strong Governance
We declassified our board of directors so that beginning at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our entire board of directors stands for re-election for a one-year term. Additionally, in 2018, our board of directors adopted a mandatory maximum age of 75 for any director nominee. 
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or reimaged are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and reimaging of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing employment matters. While we pay, on average, rates that are above the federal minimum wage, and where applicable, state minimum wage, increases in those minimum wages have in the past increased wage rates at our restaurants and in the future will affect our labor costs. We are also subject to provisions of the comprehensive federal health care reform law. We anticipate that a combination of labor management, cost reduction initiatives, technology and menu price increases can materially offset the potential increased costs associated with future regulations.
Pollo Tropical is subject to alcoholic beverage control regulations that require state, county or municipal licenses or permits to sell alcoholic beverages at each restaurant location that sells alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed every one to two years and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Licensing entities, authorized with law enforcement authority, may issue violations and conduct audits and investigations of the restaurant's records and procedures. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants including minimum age for consumption, certification requirements for employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. These regulations also prescribe certain required banking and accounting practices related to alcohol sales and purchasing. Our restaurants are subject to state "dram-shop" laws. Dram-shop laws provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated or minor patron. We have specific insurance that covers claims arising under dram-shop laws. However, we cannot ensure that this insurance will be adequate to cover any claims that may be instituted against us. 
Human Capital Management
As of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 4,350 persons, of which approximately 100 were corporate and administrative personnel and approximately 4,250 were restaurant operations and other supervisory personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider that overall relations with our employees are favorable. 
Culture, Values & Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Fiesta, we are in the business of inclusive hospitality. We strive to create diverse, respectful spaces where innovation can thrive, where being courageous is rewarded, and where treating each other like family is a core value. 
These qualities have supported nearly 35 years of successful operations for our Pollo Tropical brand. We believe that the investments we are making in our employees, our restaurants, and our communities will contribute to our continued success in the restaurant business. 
As of January 1, 2023, approximately 60% of our U.S.-based employee population identified as female and approximately 93% of our U.S. based employee population is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, approximately 40% of our executive officers are female and approximately 40% are racial and ethnic minorities. Furthermore, approximately 60% of the restaurant field management of our restaurant brands identified as female and more than approximately 85% of this group is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities.
As a truly diverse organization, we foster a culture of inclusion that helps to remove some of the barriers to workplace entry and professional development that diverse groups might face. We provide opportunities for career progression through the training and development investments we make. Many of our field managers started as hourly team members and have had the opportunity to move up and become managers and supervisors at the corporate level. We believe in developing and promoting from within and in 2022 promoted approximately 175 employees to management or leadership roles.
We are committed to enhancing equality in ongoing career advancement for women and minorities through targeted education and development programs. Relevant initiatives include:
•Ongoing assessment and management of our talent pipeline to support the career progression of high-potential women and minorities;
•Well defined Career Path Programs for hourly employees to advance to management;
•Cultural and Compliance training for all our employees; and
•Creation of the Fiesta Women's Forum.
Total Rewards
We believe rewarding our employees for their hard work and commitment starts with pay. We pay, on average, rates that are above the federal and applicable state minimum wage. In addition to their fixed salary, restaurant and district managers are compensated with an incentive bonus, based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision. Additionally, in 2021 and 2022 in response to emerging and continuing labor challenges, we examined our overall hourly compensation and benefits programs and adjusted our wages to reflect the broader market changes. We understand the importance of offering our employees benefits for all aspects of their lives and have added additional benefits in response to our employees' needs consistent with this broader philosophy in 2021 and 2022. Through our benefits program we hope to provide our employees with the stability they need to succeed not only in their careers, but in their personal lives as well. Benefits offered to all corporate employees, who work more than 24 hours per week include paid time-off programs including holiday, personal, vacation (adjusted in 2021 to accrue on monthly basis within 90 days of an employee's start date), family leave, commuter benefits, emergency child care, and volunteer time and retirement savings plan with company match. Additionally, all employees are eligible for assistance through our non-profit, Fiesta Family Foundation, which provides assistance to our employees who have personally suffered losses or other hardships.
Training and Development 
We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all our restaurant employees and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly team members. Technology enhancements, expansion of leadership development curriculum and proven e-learning courses complement our Learning Management System platform to focus our team members on system-wide operating procedures by position, food preparation methods and guest service standards. 
We have developed a comprehensive management training program, complemented by active coaching and dedicated field training manager supervision for all new managers. During the new manager onboarding process, we customize an intensive, self-paced ongoing development program designed to prepare each employee for the next level of management. The onboarding period also includes robust classroom training with an emphasis on skill and competency building. 
In 2022, we expanded and enhanced our operations management training curriculum to include additional leadership effectiveness development with a focus on best practices for restaurant team talent development and coaching and change management. The enhanced leadership training will be continued in 2023 across all levels of operations management.
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our operations, training, marketing, real estate, facilities and culinary research and development support functions from our Pollo Tropical division headquarters in Miami, Florida. Our executive management functions are primarily conducted from our offices in Dallas, Texas, and Miami, Florida. Our management team is led by Dirk Montgomery who is currently serving as our Interim Chief Executive Officer and who served as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer until December 8, 2022, Louis DiPietro who serves as our Senior Vice President, Chief Legal and People Officer and Corporate Secretary, Hope Diaz who serves as our Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer and Tyler Yoesting who serves as our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and who is currently serving as Acting Chief Financial Officer.
