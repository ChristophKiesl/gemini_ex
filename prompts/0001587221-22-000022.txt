Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Zosano Pharma Corporation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing rapid systemic administration of therapeutics and other bioactive molecules to patients using our proprietary transdermal microneedle system (the “System”). Our System is designed to facilitate rapid drug absorption into the bloodstream, and to provide an improved pharmacokinetic (“PK”) profile compared to original dosage forms. The System consists of a 3cm2 to 6cm2 array of titanium microneedles approximately 200-350 microns in length, coated with a hydrophilic formulation of drug, mounted on an adhesive patch. The patch is designed to be applied with a reusable hand-held applicator that presses the microneedles into the skin to a uniform depth in each application, close to the capillary bed, allowing for dissolution and absorption of the drug, but not deep enough to contact the nerve endings in the skin. The microneedles are designed to penetrate the stratum corneum in an effort to allow the drug to be absorbed into the microcapillary system of the skin. We are focused on developing products for indications in which we believe rapid onset, ease of use and product stability may offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages, and on developing products where we believe rapid administration of approved drugs with established safety and efficacy profiles could provide an increased benefit to patients, in markets where patients remain underserved by existing therapies. We anticipate that many of our current and future development programs may enable us to utilize a regulatory pathway in the United States that would streamline clinical development and potentially reduce the amount of clinical data we need to obtain prior to seeking FDA approval.
We have no product sales to date, and we will not have product sales unless and until we receive approval from the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, to market and sell our product candidates. Accordingly, our success depends not only on the development, but also on our ability to finance the development of each of our product candidates. We will require substantial additional funding to complete development and seek regulatory approval for these products. In addition, as further described below, our clinical and pre-commercial manufacturing activities have been curtailed following our March 2022 workforce reduction.
M207 for Migraine
Our development efforts are currently focused on our product candidate, M207, our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing our System. Zolmitriptan is one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans and is used as an acute treatment for migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. M207 was developed with the intent of providing faster onset of efficacy and sustained freedom from migraine symptoms. M207 is designed to provide rapid absorption of zolmitriptan into the bloodstream without dependence on the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract.
We submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (“NDA”) for M207 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) on December 20, 2019, and on October 20, 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA with respect to the NDA. The CRL cited inconsistent zolmitriptan exposure levels observed across clinical pharmacology studies, which had been previously identified in the FDA’s discipline review letter that we received on September 29, 2020. Specifically, the CRL noted differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots of M207 in our trials and inadequate PK bridging between the lots that made interpretation of some safety data unclear. The CRL referenced unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan observed in five study subjects enrolled in our PK studies. The FDA recommended that we conduct a repeat bioequivalence study comparing lots manufactured with the equipment used during development. The CRL noted that additional product quality validation data, which were planned to be submitted following approval, if received, were required to be submitted with the application. In addition, the CRL mentioned that due to U.S. Government and/or Agency-wide restrictions on travel, inspections of our contract manufacturing and/or critical subcontractor facilities were not able to be conducted before the FDA's goal date for completing its review of the original NDA, but that such inspections would be required and would have to be conducted before the application may be approved. In addition, a pre-approval inspection of our Fremont, California facility by the FDA is expected. However, following a March 2022 workforce reduction, we would need to hire additional employees to support any pre-approval inspection.
On January 29, 2021, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA Division of Neurology II (the “Division”) regarding the requirements for resubmission of the M207 NDA and, in February 2021, we received the final meeting minutes from the FDA. The Type A meeting minutes were generally consistent with our expectations to conduct an additional PK study for inclusion in an NDA resubmission package. In a post-meeting comment, the FDA recommended a skin assessment on patients in the PK study to generate additional safety information, which was included in the proposed study protocol submitted to the FDA for review. After the receipt of FDA comments and recommendations to our proposed PK study protocol for M207, we made the 
Index to Financial Statements

recommended changes and established an agreement with a contract research organization to conduct the PK study required to support the resubmission of the M207 505(b)(2) NDA.
On October 4, 2021, we announced that we had received preliminary top-line results from the PK study and had been granted a Type C written response-only meeting with the FDA regarding the resubmission of the M207 NDA. On October 25, 2021, we received full data tables from our PK study, which were consistent with the previously announced preliminary top-line results. On October 27, 2021, we submitted a briefing package to the FDA in advance of the Type C written-response-only meeting previously granted by the FDA to obtain feedback on our strategy for resubmitting the M207 505(b)(2) NDA.
We received Type C written responses from the FDA with respect to our strategy for resubmitting the M207 505(b)(2) NDA, which, among other things, noted concerns regarding our approach for establishing a PK bridge to ZOMIG® nasal spray (NDA 21-450) (the “Listed Drug”) through comparisons across multiple PK studies of M207, particularly Study CP-2019-002, which included PK outliers.
On January 18, 2022, we resubmitted our NDA to the FDA. In line with our previously disclosed resubmission strategy, the NDA was resubmitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The 505(b)(2) submission relies on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of the Listed Drug. The resubmitted NDA relied primarily on data from the recently completed Phase 1 PK study (CP 2021-001), along with previous PK studies evaluating M207 (CP-2018-002 and CP-2019-002), with the goal of establishing comparative bioavailability to the Listed Drug.
On February 17, 2022, we received a response letter from the FDA with regard to our January 18, 2022 NDA resubmission. The response letter stated that the FDA did not consider the resubmitted M207 NDA to be a complete response to the deficiencies identified in the FDA’s October 20, 2020 CRL, and that the FDA will not begin substantive review of the application until a complete response is received. Among other things, the FDA’s response letter stated that our strategy for establishing a PK bridge to the Listed Drug by relying primarily on data from the Study CP-2021-001 was not acceptable, due in part to differences between the design of Study CP-2021-001, which compared the PK of M207 to two sequential doses of the Listed Drug, and the criteria for re-dosing set forth in the labeling instructions for the Listed Drug. The FDA’s response letter described alternative methods through which we may establish a PK bridge to the Listed Drug, including: (i) by demonstrating bioequivalence to the Listed Drug using standard criteria for all PK exposure metrics, including through a combination of relevant PK data and modeling or simulation procedures; or (ii) by conducting a relative bioavailability study in healthy volunteer subjects. We are continuing to evaluate our next steps in relation to the FDA’s response letter. There is no guarantee that we will be able to adequately address the issues raised to the FDA’s satisfaction. In addition, if the FDA does not allow us to resubmit our M207 NDA using our existing PK data comparing ZOMIG® nasal spray and patches produced on manufacturing equipment at our Fremont, California facility that also produced patches for our long-term safety study, then the approval pathway for M207 will likely take significantly longer than expected, cost significantly more than anticipated, and may not be successful.
We have incurred and will incur additional costs and delays in our previously anticipated timeline for potential commercialization due to the additional PK study and the FDA’s response to our January 18, 2022 NDA resubmission, and we may incur higher than anticipated additional costs should any additional studies or other requirements be required by the FDA.
If FDA approval is ultimately received, we plan to manufacture a limited supply of commercial product at our facility in Fremont, California, which is designed to comply with the FDA's current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations on a timeline yet to be determined. We will also rely on various Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”) to produce various components of our product, our applicator and final packaging of the finished product. If M207 is approved, we and our CMOs will be required to produce commercial supply of M207 in accordance with cGMP regulations. Should M207 be approved, we may consider expanding production through the use of CMOs for drug product as well as for production of the various components that comprise our patch, our applicator and the final packaging of the finished product. However, we will not be able to produce M207 drug product on our manufacturing equipment at our third-party CMOs without subsequent FDA approvals, which may require us to conduct additional clinical studies and incur significant time and cost. We do not anticipate realizing product revenues unless and until the FDA approves the M207 NDA and we begin commercializing M207, which events may never occur.
Eversana Agreement
On August 6, 2020, we entered into a master services agreement (the “Eversana Agreement”) with Eversana Life Science Services, LLC (“Eversana”) for the commercialization of M207 in the United States, if approved by the FDA. Under the terms of the Eversana Agreement, we maintain ownership of the M207 NDA as well as all legal, regulatory and manufacturing responsibilities for M207. Eversana receives an exclusive right to conduct agreed commercialization activities and will utilize its internal sales organization along with its other commercial capabilities for market access, marketing, distribution and patient 
Index to Financial Statements

support services for M207. Eversana will receive reimbursement of certain commercialization costs pursuant to a commercialization budget originally estimated at approximately $250.0 million and a low double digit to mid-teen percentage of product profits if and when our net sales of M207 surpass certain costs incurred by the parties pursuant to the commercialization budget.
The term of the Eversana Agreement is five years following the date, if any, that the FDA approves the M207 NDA. We may terminate the Eversana Agreement if Eversana fails to provide pre-commercial or commercial plans and budgets by specified dates, if we decide to discontinue development or commercialization efforts for M207 in the United States (subject to a termination payment if such termination occurs within a specified time period), or upon a change of control. Either party could terminate the Eversana Agreement if FDA approval was not received by July 31, 2021, if net profits are not realized within a specified time period following commercial launch, for material breach of the Eversana Agreement by the other party that is not cured within a defined time period, for insolvency of the other party, if M207 is subject to a safety recall in the United States or if M207 is not commercially launched within a specified time period after FDA approval of the NDA (other than by reason of the terminating party’s failure to perform its obligations under the Eversana Agreement).
In addition, under the Eversana Agreement, following FDA approval of the M207 NDA, Eversana agreed to provide a revolving credit facility of up to $5.0 million (the “Credit Facility”) to us pursuant to a loan agreement to be entered into between Eversana and us on a subsequent date. The loan will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 10.0%, to be paid monthly, and we will be able to prepay any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility at any time without penalty or premium. The Credit Facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets, subject to prior liens and security interests.
On September 28, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1, effective as of September 29, 2021 (the “Eversana Amendment”), to the Eversana Agreement, which modified the provision in the Eversana Agreement that provided for termination by either party of the Eversana Agreement if FDA approval was not received by July 31, 2021 to December 31, 2021, with written notice within sixty days of such date. In addition, the Eversana Amendment provides that if the NDA is approved, the deferral mechanism, payment terms and loan terms in the Eversana Agreement will be adjusted as mutually agreed by both parties. Neither party exercised its right to terminate the Eversana Agreement due to FDA approval not being received by December 31, 2021.
We currently have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and we plan to rely on Eversana and other third parties for the commercialization of M207, if approved.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to make transdermal drug delivery a preferred delivery modality for indications where we believe that rapid onset, ease of use and room temperature stability of the formulation may offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages to patients and healthcare providers. While our near-term focus has been the development and commercialization, if approved, of our lead product candidate, M207, our internal capabilities in these areas have been curtailed following our March 2022 workforce reduction. The key elements of our strategy are to:
Develop and commercialize M207. We believe that M207 has the potential to provide therapeutic and practical advantages, such as the following:
•Rapid absorption: We believe M207 is the only triptan currently formulated to be delivered transdermally and designed to have a rapid onset of action. In a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trial, M207 provided rapid and reproducible zolmitriptan delivery. The amount of time it took zolmitriptan to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) was less than 20 minutes and was similar to subcutaneously administered sumatriptan. In the placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial, M207 demonstrated pain relief beginning as early as 15 minutes (becoming statistically significant by 60 minutes).
•Symptom relief: In our placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial, M207 demonstrated significant pain freedom, pain relief and freedom from most bothersome symptom (“MBS”) at two hours post-treatment, with most patients not requiring additional rescue medications. Post-hoc analyses of patients with difficult to treat migraine, such as morning migraine, migraine with nausea, migraine with severe pain and patients who delayed treatment, showed clinically significant pain freedom and relief as compared to placebo. Additionally, the results from our Long-Term Safety Study (“LTSS”) of M207 were similar to those of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial.
•Durability: In the placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial, M207 demonstrated durable impact on pain freedom and pain relief through 24 and 48 hours, compared to placebo.
Index to Financial Statements

•Favorable Safety Findings: In the LTSS, data from safety assessments showed that M207 was well-tolerated throughout the 12 months of repeated use. The most common adverse events were redness and swelling at the application site of which more than 95% were classified as mild. Moreover, 80% of these site reactions resolved within 48 hours.
Pursue additional product candidates We have conducted initial feasibility studies on a number of compounds which suggest that our System may have potential for further evaluation with large molecules, small molecules, and vaccines. We are focused on programs where we believe rapid drug delivery, ease of use and formulation room temperature stability may offer meaningful therapeutic and practical advantages to patients and healthcare providers. We are pursuing these programs internally and, in some cases, with certain strategic partners to further the potential clinical and commercial development of such product candidates.
On November 17, 2021, we announced that we had successfully formulated a vaccine developer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate on our System.
On January 5, 2022, we announced the publication of Phase 1 clinical trial data in an article titled, “Immunogenicity and Safety of Inactivated Influenza Split-Virion Vaccine Administered via a Transdermal Microneedle System” in the Journal of Vaccines and Immunology. The study demonstrated that a low dose of a trivalent influenza vaccine administered via our transdermal microneedle system produced antibody levels that met the European Medicines Agency’s three criteria for influenza vaccine efficacy, including seroconversion rate, mean increase in hemagglutinin inhibition titer, and percentage of seroprotected subjects, and was generally well tolerated.
M207 for Migraine
The focus of our development efforts is on our product candidate M207, our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan, delivered via our System, which is a member of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans, used for the acute treatment of migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. A migraine often lasts between four and 24 hours but may last as long as three days. Our M207 System is designed to be applied to an individual’s upper arm and to deliver zolmitriptan to the systemic circulation, with the objective of:
•Providing rapid absorption of drug;
•Clinically meaningful pain freedom and pain relief;
•Clinically meaningful freedom from most bothersome symptom;
•Sustained freedom from migraine symptoms up to 48 hours post-treatment; and
•Avoiding exposure to the GI tract.
According to the American Research Foundation, migraine is a prevalent, chronic and disabling neurological disease impacting one billion patients globally, making it the third most common disease in the world. The World Health Organization places migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses. The Migraine Research Foundation provides that, among women, who are disproportionately affected by migraine, 25% of migraine sufferers experience four or more severe attacks per month. 
In the United States, migraine affects approximately 37 million people, representing approximately 18% of women, 6% of men and 10% of children in the country. Nearly one in four United States households includes someone who suffers from migraine. For more than 90% of those affected, migraine interferes with education, career or social activities. Migraine attacks are estimated to lead to lost productivity costs as high as $36 billion annually in the United States.
According to published studies, many patients experience difficult to treat migraine with:
•41% reporting severe headache attacks are present upon awakening or morning migraine;
•44% report persistent frequent nausea during a migraine;
•49% report avoiding or delaying taking migraine medication; and
•53% report severe headache attacks come on very quickly.
Index to Financial Statements

While new classes of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine have been recently approved, triptans remain the standard of care for an acute migraine attack. The American Headache Society Position Statement on Integrating New Migraine Treatments into Clinical Practice recommends:
•Treating early after the onset of a migraine attack;
•Choosing a non-oral route of administration for selected patients;
•Accounting for tolerability and safety issues; and
•Using migraine-specific agents (triptans & Dihydroergotamine) for moderate or severe attacks.
Patients however remain dissatisfied with their acute treatments. Patient reported outcomes from the Unmet Acute Treatment Needs from the 2017 Migraine in America Symptoms and Treatment Study (the “2017 MAST Study”) showed that:
•74% of patients had inadequate treatment response; and
•Approximately 49% experienced inadequate pain freedom.
We believe that each of the currently available methods of non-oral administration, including nasal spray and subcutaneous injection, have significant disadvantages. Nasal sprays have been associated with taste disturbances. Patients are hesitant to self-administer injections, and according to the 2017 MAST Study, 82% of patients discontinued using an injectable triptan due to side effects.
Two new classes of drugs, a Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (“CGRP”) antagonist and a 5-HT (1F) agonist for the acute treatment of migraine were approved in 2019, and one additional CGRP antagonist was approved in 2020. While these new acute treatment medications offer clinicians and patients greater choice, we believe these products also have limitations:
•These drugs are oral tablets, and with many migraine patients reporting nausea with their attacks, taking a tablet can be difficult.
•Published clinical studies on the CGRP receptor antagonists showed less than optimal therapeutic gain (active-placebo percentages) for pain freedom and sustained pain freedom.
•FDA labeling with the 5-HT (1F) agonist drug includes an eight-hour driving restriction and is a DEA scheduled drug.
ZOTRIP Phase 2/3 Trial Achieved Statistical Significance on Co-primary Endpoints with the 3.8mg Dose
On February 13, 2017, we announced the results of our ZOTRIP placebo-controlled efficacy trial for M207. The ZOTRIP trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of M207 (1.0mg, 1.9mg, and 3.8mg) to placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. Subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial at 36 centers across the United States. Those subjects recruited into the trial had a history of at least one year of migraine episodes with or without aura. Upon recruitment, the subjects entered a one-month run-in period that ensured they met the key eligibility criteria of two to eight migraine attacks per month, which was documented using an electronic diary or an app on their cell phone. Subjects also identified the most bothersome symptoms and indicated the presence or absence of nausea, phonophobia or photophobia, during the episodes in the run-in period. Successfully screened subjects were then randomized into the treatment/dosing period in which they had 8 weeks to confirm and receive blinded treatment for a single migraine attack, termed “qualifying migraine,” in which the subject’s most bothersome symptom had to be present. During a qualifying migraine, subjects scored the severity of pain on a 4-point scale, the presence or absence of migraine-associated symptoms (phonophobia, photophobia, or nausea), starting pre-dose and then at several intervals over 48 hours post-dose. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. Safety was assessed by adverse events reported and other standard safety measures.
589 subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial, of which 365 were randomized. Of those randomized, 333 subjects were treated and are included in the safety analysis, and 321 qualified for the modified intent-to-treat population. With the multiple doses and multiple endpoints in the trial, a sequential testing procedure was used beginning with the highest dose and the co-primary endpoints. Since statistical significance was not achieved for most bothersome symptom in the 1.9 mg group, statistical significance cannot be claimed for testing thereafter. Therefore, p-values for secondary endpoints should be considered nominal p-values.
As illustrated in the tables and figure below, the ZOTRIP trial results demonstrated that the 3.8mg M207 dose achieved statistically significant pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. The 3.8mg dose also achieved statistical significance in the secondary endpoints of pain freedom at 45 minutes and 60 minutes and showed durability of effect on pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours. Additionally, M207 was not associated with any serious adverse events (“SAEs”). While the 1.0mg and 1.9mg doses of M207 demonstrated statistical significance in pain freedom at two hours, they did not achieve

statistical significance in freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours. Statistical significance is an indicator of the likelihood of an observed effect being due to the study drug rather than due to chance. The “p” value is the probability of an event occurring by chance alone. When the p value is less than 5% (0.05) the results are considered to be statistically significant.

M207 LTSS
In November 2017, we initiated our LTSS for M207 as an acute treatment of migraine. The LTSS was an open label study evaluating the safety of the 3.8 mg dose of M207 in migraine patients who had historically experienced at least two migraines per month. Patients were expected to treat a minimum of two migraines per month on average, with no maximum treatment limits. The study was conducted at 31 sites in the United States with a defined data set per protocol in which 150 subjects received repeated doses for six months and 50 subjects received repeated doses for one year. The study was open-label, with investigator visits at months one, two, three, six, nine and twelve to record adverse events, if any. The primary objective of the LTSS was to assess safety of M207 during repeated use over six and twelve months. Other endpoints were electrocardiography and laboratory parameters, as well as percentage of headaches with pain-free response. 
In October 2018, we announced the completion of the first phase of our LTSS with more than 150 evaluable subjects completing six months of treatment with M207. In February 2019, we announced the completion of the second phase of our LTSS with more than 50 evaluable subjects completing one year of treatment with M207.
In September 2019, final results from the LTSS were presented at the 19th Congress of the International Headache Society in Dublin, Ireland. In the trial, 257 subjects were treated on average for two or more migraines per month for six months and 127 subjects treated on average two or more migraines a month for twelve months. Data from safety assessments showed that M207 was well-tolerated throughout the 12 months of repeated use. The most common adverse events were redness and swelling at the application site following patch application, of which more than 95% were classified as mild. More than 80% of these site reactions were gone within 48 hours. Patients treated with M207 reported less triptan-like neurological side effects than are typically found with the class, with less than 2% of patients reporting effects such as dizziness and paresthesia.
Post-hoc Efficacy Analyses of M207
In June 2020, we presented new post-hoc efficacy analyses of M207 as a virtual oral presentation on the 2020 American Headache Society’s Virtual Annual Scientific Meeting Platform. Six different measurements of pain reduction from the exploratory efficacy results in the LTSS were examined and compared to the positive clinical results observed in the Phase 2/3 Zotrip study. Across all six efficacy measurements, which included pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, clinical activity observed in the LTSS during the one-year trial period treating approximately 5,600 migraine episodes was consistent with the positive placebo-controlled study results.

Similar to the placebo-controlled study, the most common adverse events observed in the LTSS were redness and swelling at the application site, of which more than 95% were classified as mild. 80% of these site reactions were generally resolved within 48 hours. Subjects treated with M207 reported less triptan-like neurological side effects than are typically found with the class, with less than 2% of subjects in the LTSS reporting effects such as dizziness and paresthesia.
On February 1, 2021, we announced that early onset of action data for M207 were presented at the Annual Headache Cooperative of the Pacific Winter Conference. In a post-hoc retrospective analysis of data from the previously published ZOTRIP trial involving 365 subjects who received M207 3.8 mg or placebo, of 82 M207-treated subjects, 38 reported pain relief at 30 minutes, and 28 of the 38 subjects (74%) were pain free at two hours. All 6 subjects treated with M207 who reported pain freedom at 30 minutes were pain-free at two hours. This compares to nine of 26 subjects (35%) in the placebo group (n=77) who reported pain relief at 30 minutes that were pain free at 2 hours, and 1 of 2 subjects that were pain free at 30 minutes being pain free at 2 hours.

Migraine Assessment of Current Therapy (“Migraine-ACT”) scores for M207 were evaluated at each clinical visit during the LTSS. The Migraine-ACT score is established using a questionnaire that assesses four key components of effective migraine treatment, including: (1) global assessment of relief (2-hour pain freedom), (2) headache impact, (3) consistency of response and (4) emotional response. At the last time point assessed (after 48 weeks of therapy) (n=184), we observed that the Migraine-ACT scores as of October 2019, remained highly favorable across the four questions evaluated:

Question | Proportion who answered “Yes”
Does your migraine medication work consistently, in the majority of your attacks? | 95% 
Does the headache pain disappear within 2 hours? | 83% 
Are you able to function normally within 2 hours? | 86% 
Are you comfortable enough with your medication to be able to plan your daily activities? | 93% 

C213 for the Treatment of Cluster Headache
In October 2019, we announced that we had begun enrolling patients in our Acute Treatment of Cluster Headache placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of C213 for the acute treatment of cluster headache. Like M207 for the potential acute treatment of migraine, C213 for the potential acute treatment of cluster headache consists of our investigational proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing our proprietary transdermal microneedle system. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new enrollment into the clinical trial was temporarily suspended between March 2020 and June 2020. Subject enrollment resumed in July 2020, however, at a rate slower than originally anticipated. In November 2020, we decided to end enrollment of new subjects into the clinical trial as of December 31, 2020. Subjects enrolled in the Phase 2/3 trial prior to December 31, 2020, were randomized to receive 1.9 mg of C213, 3.8 mg of C213, or placebo in a 1:1:1 fashion. The co-primary endpoints of the study are the proportion of patients who achieve pain relief at 15 minutes and the proportion of patients whose pain relief is sustained from 15 minutes to 60 minutes. A total of 42 subjects were randomized in the trial. Of the subjects randomized, 23 subjects treated a cluster attack with C213 and of those who treated, 22 had post-treatment self-reported diary data. Of the treated subjects, eight received placebo, nine received 1.9 mg of C213 and five received 3.8 mg of C213. The percentage of subjects who were positive for both co-primary endpoints (pain relief at 15 minutes and pain relief at 
Index to Financial Statements

15 minutes sustained to 60 minutes) were 37.5% placebo, 44.4% C213 1.9 mg and 100% C213 3.8 mg. There were five adverse events, all mild in intensity, reported by one placebo subject and three C213 1.9 mg subjects. The number of subjects who treated a cluster attack was not sufficient to perform pre-planned statistical comparisons. We plan to present these results at an upcoming scientific conference.
Our Research Programs
Our internal research and development programs use molecules with established safety and efficacy that are formulated to enable delivery through our proprietary System. In selecting our development candidates, we consider the therapeutic advantage of rapid onset, the size of the market, the level of competition and the commercial value.
Our System consists of a 3cm2 to 6cm2 array of titanium microneedles approximately 200-350 microns in length, coated with a hydrophilic formulation of drug, attached to an adhesive patch. The maximum amount of drug that can be coated on a patch’s microneedle array depends on the active molecule of the drug formulation, the weight of the excipients in the drug formulation, and the coatable surface area of the microneedle array. For example, we use patches with 2cm2, 3cm2 and 6cm2 microneedle arrays. In the placebo-controlled trial for M207, we used two 3cm2 patches to deliver the appropriate dose. Based on our testing, we believe 3.8mg of zolmitriptan could also be coated on a single patch with a 6cm2 microneedle array while maintaining acceptable tolerability. The patch is applied with a hand-held reusable applicator that presses the microneedles into the skin to a uniform depth in each application, close to the capillary bed, allowing for dissolution and absorption of the drug, but not deep enough to contact the nerve endings in the skin. The targeted patch wear time is generally thirty to sixty minutes.
We have tested our System in preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies that demonstrated its technical feasibility with multiple compounds, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Based on this research, we believe that our System can be used to deliver treatments for a wide variety of indications in which rapid absorption can enhance onset of efficacy and sustainability of effect. That coupled with ease of use might offer particularly important therapeutic, practical, and commercial advantages over existing options. We are pursuing these programs internally and, in some cases, with certain strategic partners to further the potential clinical and commercial development of such product candidates.
Competition
Competition for our Product Candidates
The development and commercialization of new products to treat migraine and cluster headache is highly competitive. Several key competitive factors have the potential to affect M207, if approved. These include safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payers and government institutions.
We expect to have considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory compliance and global commercialization.
Companies marketing products or that have products in development to treat migraine or cluster headache which may compete with our M207 or C213 product candidates include, but are not limited to, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly & Company, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Allergan, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Lundbeck, Amgen, Merck & Co., Pfizer, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Endo International, Assertio, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Supernus Pharmaceutical, Currax Pharmaceuticals, Impel NeuroPharma, Axsome Therapeutics, electroCore, eNeura, Cefaly, Theranica, Amneal Pharmaceuticals and generic manufacturers of acute and preventive therapies.
Competition in Drug Delivery Platforms
In addition to competition for our product candidates, as we develop opportunities to expand our product pipeline utilizing our drug delivery System, we face additional competition from companies that are developing or that may develop and license drug delivery platforms similar to ours. Such companies include, but are not limited to Kindeva Drug Delivery, Radius Health Inc., Vaxxas Inc., Becton, Dickinson and Company, Vaxess Technologies, Inc., NanoPass Technologies Ltd., Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Manufacturing and Research and Development
The manufacturing process for our System consists of three primary operations: (1) the formation of the microneedle array, involving etching of titanium foil and subsequent array forming, (2) the application of the drug formulation to the microneedle array and (3) the manufacturing of the reusable applicator.
Index to Financial Statements

We operate a manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, designed to comply with cGMP and believe we have adequate manufacturing capabilities and capacity to produce our System for initial commercial batches, if M207 is approved. We purchase various components or intermediates of our System from third-party vendors, including titanium foil, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, inner ring, adhesive backing, ring and backing assembly, outer ring and primary and secondary packaging components. We also outsource the manufacturing of our applicators.
We have engaged CMOs to produce commercial supplies of M207. Additional CMOs have been engaged for the production of components that comprise our System and these CMOs are currently building out facilities, installing equipment, and developing and validating the processes necessary to manage commercial operations for M207. If the NDA for M207 is successfully resubmitted and approved by the FDA, we will only be able to produce limited quantities of M207 at our Fremont, California location and we will not be able to produce M207 drug product on our manufacturing equipment at our third-party CMOs without subsequent FDA approvals.
The CRL received from the FDA mentioned that due to U.S. Government and/or Agency-wide restrictions on travel, inspections of Zosano’s contract manufacturing facilities were not able to be conducted but that such inspection would be required before the M207 NDA may be approved. In addition, a pre-approval inspection of our Fremont, California facility by the FDA is expected. However, following a March 2022 workforce reduction, we would need to hire additional employees to support any pre-approval inspection.
As of December 31, 2021, our research and development group consisted of 29 employees, located at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. Our research and development staff have broad knowledge and skills in a range of disciplines applicable to formulation of drugs and the design and manufacture of our System. The group has particular expertise in two areas critical to our success: developing drug formulations that can be delivered using our System and optimizing the technology to deliver those drugs.
As part of our workforce reduction in March 2022, the number of research and development employees was reduced to 21, and, as a result, our clinical and pre-commercial manufacturing activities have been curtailed. The goals of our research and development efforts are to identify and develop drugs that can be delivered using our System. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $21.0 million and $21.6 million, respectively, of research and development expense. See Part II. Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property strategy relies on a combination of patent, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and on license and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology and brand. The laws of some countries in which our products may be licensed in the future may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
As of January 31, 2022, we held exclusive licenses to or owned 18 U.S. patents and had six pending U.S. patent applications, covering key features of our System, such as formulation, methods of treatment, coating, array design, patch anchoring, patch application, delivery, manufacturing and packaging.
We have licensed all of these patents and patent applications from ALZA Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (“ALZA”), on an exclusive basis for all countries, with the exception of (i) two issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. patent applications, one pending U.S. provisional patent application and ten foreign (including two European) patent applications covering the formulation of M207, (ii) two U.S. patents and one European patent, and one pending European patent application covering stable glucagon peptide formulations, (iii) one pending international patent application covering transdermal active agent delivery devices having coronavirus vaccine coated microprotrusions, (iv) one pending international patent application covering transdermal drug delivery devices having psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (“LSD”) or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“MDMA”) coated microprotrusions, and (v) one pending U.S. patent application related to methods of determining in vitro dissolution. These patents and patent applications are foundational and apply generally to our product candidates and applicator. Under the terms of the license agreement with ALZA, we are responsible for all development and development costs related to our System. We are also responsible for commercializing our System, including preparing and paying for all related regulatory filings. We are obligated to pay ALZA royalties in the low to mid-single digits on sales by us of products that utilize the intellectual property covered by the licensed patents or any intellectual property that may be developed by us based on certain ALZA know-how or inventions, and to pay ALZA amounts equal to the greater of royalties in the low to mid- single digits on sales by our sublicensees of such products or a percentage in the mid-teens to low twenties of royalties received by us on sales by our sublicensees of such products. We are also obligated to pay ALZA a percentage of non-royalty revenue that we receive from our sublicensees based on sales of such products. The license 
Index to Financial Statements

agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our obligations to make the royalty and other payments described above to ALZA. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon prior written notice to ALZA, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the agreement by the other party.
We have filed six pending U.S. patent applications and 11 pending foreign applications covering our single-use applicator and formulations of zolmitriptan, stable glucagon peptide, and applicator devices having coronavirus vaccine, psilocybin, LSD or MDMA-coated microprotrusions. The last of our issued technology platform patents are projected to expire in 2027.
We rely on trade secrets to protect substantial portions of our technology. We generally seek to protect these trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions with our employees, consultants and partners, and have restricted access to our manufacturing facilities and other technology.
We have one U.S. registered trademark to Zosano, “ZOSANO PHARMA”, Reg. No. 3705884 and four pending U.S. trademark applications: Trademark App. No. 87851807 for “QNOVIS”, Trademark App. No. 87855458 for “TIZOVIAL”, Trademark App. No. 87855469 for “QIXONTI”, and Trademark App. No. 87855481 for “AXILARIM”.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
United States—FDA Process
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as a drug/device combination product. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. To facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination of whether a product is a combination product, or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. In the case of our product candidates, we believe the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our M207 product candidate.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and devices pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Approval Process 
None of our product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•FDA acceptance and review of the NDA, which may require an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
Index to Financial Statements

•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of select clinical trial sites, and the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug, along with its device components, is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
•FDA approval of the NDA.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, product chemistry, controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin. An IND will automatically become effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 
•Phase 1: In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2: Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. 
•Phase 3: Phase 3 trials help obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after FDA approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication or otherwise when requested by the FDA in the form of post-market commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 post-market studies could result in withdrawal of FDA approval. 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
Index to Financial Statements

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees.
The FDA has a goal of 60 days from its receipt of an NDA submission to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that such NDA submission is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA submission for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. The FDA endeavors to complete a standard review of an application within ten to twelve months of submission, whereas FDA's goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months of submission, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMP regulations. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA has unresolved questions regarding the submission and does not approve the NDA or if there are significant concerns regarding the manufacturing facilities or clinical trial sites, it will issue a CRL to indicate that the first review cycle for an application is complete and that the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information required for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and 
Index to Financial Statements

effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Hatch-Waxman Act
As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which provide alternative pathways to regulatory approval through Sections 505(j) and 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, were enacted. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(j) permits applicants with generic drug products to submit an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) in reliance upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. Under these pathways, the FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by a Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
To the extent that an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug (“RLD”), the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDA’s Orange Book publication that relate to the RLD. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product.
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the new application. The application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity or orphan drug exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired.
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA sponsor and to all patent holders for the RLD once the applicant’s ANDA or Section 505(b)2 NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA sponsor and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30-month automatic stay on approval, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30-month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant’s NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of non-patent data exclusivity for new chemical entities which prevents the FDA from accepting ANDA and Section 505(b)(2) applications containing the protected active ingredient until the expiration of the five year market exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA's approval of new uses of approved products such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths or conditions of use. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the information supporting the approval of the drug or the change to the drug for which the information was submitted and the exclusivity granted until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of products that we may market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we will be required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of any of our products, if approved, that are reimbursed by such entities. We have consciously selected compounds for development that offer therapeutic benefit based on fast onset of action. If our product candidates are approved

by the FDA, we intend to work with payers to demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products over other delivery modalities and we intend to secure adequate and commercially favorable pricing and reimbursement levels, but we cannot guarantee that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available.
In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product or product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies. 
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products or product candidates if approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“ACA”), which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:
•An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;

•Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; and
•A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of two percent (2%) per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken.
If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, many of which may become more applicable to us if any of our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician sunshine transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, including those described below. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.

The federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented under the ACA, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We are also and may become subject to analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.
Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/or imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, (“UK GDPR”) which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
