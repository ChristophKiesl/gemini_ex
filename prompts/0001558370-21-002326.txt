​
Business Strategy
​
The Company’s current business strategy is to continue operating a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community bank with a significant presence in Central and Eastern Kentucky. Management believes the optimum way to grow the Company is by attracting new loan and deposit customers within its existing markets through its product offerings and premier customer service. 
​
Lending
​
Kentucky Bank is engaged in general full-service commercial and consumer banking. A significant part of Kentucky Bank’s operating activities include originating loans, approximately 81% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2020. Kentucky Bank makes commercial, agricultural and real estate loans to its commercial customers, with emphasis on small-to-medium-sized industrial, service and agricultural businesses. It also makes residential mortgage, installment and other loans to its individual and other non-commercial customers.

Loan Rates: Kentucky Bank offers variable and fixed rate loans.  Loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward based on changes in the loan’s index.  Rate adjustments on variable rate loans are made from 1 day to 10 years.  Variable rate loans may contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases or decreases over the life of the loan. In addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments, loans secured by residential real estate may contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of 200 basis points. There is usually no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate.
​
Credit Risk: Commercial lending and real estate construction lending, generally include a higher degree of credit risk than other loans, such as residential mortgage loans.  Commercial loans, like other loans, are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements. Collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower’s financial strength, the terms and amount of the loan, and collateral available to secure the loan.  Credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower.  Credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan’s outstanding balance.  
​
For construction loans, inaccurate initial estimates of a project’s costs and the property’s completed value could weaken the Company’s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property. Secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles, boats, and other motor vehicles.  In most cases, loans are restricted to Kentucky Bank’s general market area.
​
Other Products: Kentucky Bank offers its customers a variety of other services, including checking, savings, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, safe deposit facilities, credit cards and other consumer-oriented financial services. Kentucky Bank has Internet banking, including bill payment available to its customers at www.kybank.com. Through its Wealth Management Department, Kentucky Bank provides brokerage services, annuities, life and long term care insurance, personal trust and agency services (including management agency services).
​
Competition and Market Served
​
Competition:  The banking business is highly competitive. Competition arises from a number of sources, including other bank holding companies and commercial banks, consumer finance companies, thrift institutions, other financial institutions and financial intermediaries. In addition to commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions actively compete to provide a wide variety of banking services. Mortgage banking firms, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies and government agencies provide additional competition for loans and for many other financial services. Kentucky Bank also currently competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries, including brokerage firms and mutual funds, which offer a diverse range of investment alternatives. In addition, financial technology, or “FinTech,” companies are emerging in key areas of banking. Some of the Company’s competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the Company and its subsidiary bank. In addition, the Company must compete with competitors that have greater financial resources than the Company.
​
Market Served. We primarily conduct our business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Our primary market areas consist of Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties in Kentucky. Per capita personal income for Kentucky during the third quarter increased from $44,078 in 2019 to $45,966 in 2020, according to data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate in Kentucky increased from 2019 to 2020. The unemployment rate in Kentucky was 6.0% for December 2020, and 4.3% for December 2019.
​
Nature of Company’s Business
The business of the Company is not seasonal. The Company’s business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have material adverse effect on the Company. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any governmental entity.

Human Capital Resources
​
At December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 245 employees, with 236 full-time equivalent team members. The Company respects, values, and invites diversity in our team members, customers, suppliers, marketplace, and community. We seek to recognize the unique contribution each individual brings to our company, and we are fully committed to supporting a rich culture of diversity as a cornerstone to our success. The Company strives to attract, develop and retain talented individuals in every community we serve. We provide professional development opportunities to team members and seek to improve retention, development, and job satisfaction of team members from diverse groups by providing career skills training, peer mentoring, and opportunities to interact with senior leaders. We believe our culture encourages our team to take initiative, accept challenges and achieve goals, all of which enables our team to work efficiently while providing excellent customer service which supports the Company’s strong performance.
​
Kentucky Bank employees actively share their talents in their communities through volunteer activities in education, economic development, human and health services, and Community Reinvestment. Through our HOME (Helping Our Markets Excel) program we donate resources to programs that strive to improve the quality of life for those living and working in the communities we serve.
 ​
We are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members, customers, and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges to maintain team member and customer safety while continuing to be open for business. Accordingly, we launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak that included managing our pandemic response, providing access to recent safety standards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other agencies; as well as our workplace guidelines for non-customer and customer environments. In addition, current information is shared through regular emails and other digital communications with our team members and customers facing financial hardships due to COVID-19. Additional actions included adjusting our banking center hours, lobby usage, and encouraging team members to work remotely where possible during the pandemic. We continue to monitor our footprint for areas where there is a resurgence or regression of COVID-19 and adjust our banking center availability accordingly. Our banking centers are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes, while our online banking network is continuously available for digital banking transactions. Lastly, the availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine will drive the re-opening plans of state and local economies in 2021. However, economic uncertainty remains high and bouts of elevated volatility are expected to continue. Despite such continued uncertainty, the health and well-being of our employees and customers will always be our top priority.
​
Supervision and Regulation
​
Governing Regulatory Institutions: As a financial holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company’s subsidiary bank is subject to supervision and regulation by applicable state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions. Kentucky Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. In addition to the impact of regulation, Kentucky Bank is affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. The company also has a captive insurance subsidiary which is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance.
​
Laws Protecting Deposits: There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy. These obligations and restrictions are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insured funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default. For example, under a policy of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default.
​

The federal banking agencies also have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”, as such terms are defined under uniform regulation defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies.
​
Capital and Liquidity: On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules known as the “Basel III Capital Rules” substantially revising the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The Basel III Capital Rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. Certain of the Basel III Capital Rules came into effect for the Company and Kentucky Bank on January 1, 2015; these rules are subject to a phase-in period which ended on January 31, 2018.
​
Under the current rules, which were effective January 1, 2015, the Company is subject to additional capital requirements that include: (i) creation of a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, (ii) an increase to the minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, (iii) changes to risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, (iv) creation of an additional capital conservation buffer in excess of the required minimum capital ratios, and (v) changes to what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these capital requirements.
​
The Basel III Capital Rules were fully phased in effective January 1, 2019 and require banking organizations to maintain:
​

● | a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to the Company or Kentucky Bank.
​
The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.
​
The Basel III Capital Rules provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and Kentucky Bank were given a one-time election (“Opt-out Election”) to filter certain accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) components, comparable to the treatment under the previous general risk-based capital rule. The Company and Kentucky Bank elected to choose the AOCI Opt-out Election.
​
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and are being phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is being phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules revised the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity. They established a new framework under which mortgage-backed securities and other securitization exposures are subject to risk-weights ranging from 20% to 1,250%.

The federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule that provides for an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy, the community bank leverage ratio framework, for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020. This final rule is applicable to all non-advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Highlights of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework follow:

● | The community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) final rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and allows qualifying community banking organizations to calculate a leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy. Banks opting into the CBLR framework (CBLR banks) will not be required to calculate or report risk-based capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A qualifying community banking organization is defined as having less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, all as of the most recent quarter. A bank that elects to use the CBLR framework will generally be considered well-capitalized and to have met the risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the capital regulations if it has a leverage ratio greater than 9%. As required by the CARES Act, the FDIC temporarily lowered the CBLR to 8% beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Beginning in 2021, the CBLR will increase to 8.5% for that calendar year. The CBLR will return to 9% on January 1, 2022. The interim final rules also maintain a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 1 percent below the applicable community bank leverage ratio. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The final rule adopts tier 1 capital and the existing leverage ratio into the community bank leverage ratio framework. The tier 1 numerator takes into account the modifications made in relation to the capital simplifications and current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) transitions rules as of the compliance dates of those rules.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A CBLR bank will not be subject to other capital and leverage requirements. It will be deemed to have met the "well capitalized" ratio requirements and be in compliance with the generally applicable capital rule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A CBLR may opt out of the framework at any time, without restriction, by reverting to the generally applicable risk-based capital rule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The rules also establish adjusted risk-weights for credit exposures, including multi-family and commercial real estate exposures that are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual, are subject to a 150% risk-weight, except in situations where qualifying collateral and/or guarantees are in place. The existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a 50% risk-weight (for prudently underwritten owner-occupied first liens that are current or less than 90 days past due) or a 100% risk-weight (for all other residential mortgage exposures including 90 days or more past due exposures). As shown in Note 20, the Company and Kentucky Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements, and management does not anticipate any adverse impact from the implementation of the new capital ratio.
​
Deposit Insurance: The Company is subject to several deposit insurance assessments, which are described below:
​
FDIC Assessments. The Company’s subsidiary bank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to the amount permitted by law. The Company’s subsidiary bank is thus subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating.
​
The assessment base must, with some possible exceptions, equal average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The FDIC has adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the reserve ratio increases to 1.35% from 1.15% of insured deposits by 2020. The assessment regulations (12 CFR Part 327) provide that after the reserve ratio reaches 1.38 percent (and provided that it remains at least 1.38 percent), the FDIC will automatically apply small bank (total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion) credits to reduce small banks’ regular deposit insurance assessments up to the full amounts of their assessments or the full amount of their credits, whichever is less.  Credits will be awarded to any bank, including any small bank affiliate of a large bank, that was a small bank at some point during the credit calculation period (i.e., credit accruing institution).  During 2019, the FDIC met target goals pertaining to the DIF. This resulted in the Bank receiving credits totaling $148 thousand that were applied directly to the Company’s FDIC insurance assessment. 
​

Financing Corporation (“FICO”) Assessments. FICO assessment costs were $0 in 2020 and 2019. FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 possessing assessment powers in addition to the FDIC. The FDIC acts as a collection agent for FICO, whose sole purpose is to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. Outstanding FICO bonds as of December 31, 2018, which were 30-year noncallable bonds, matured in 2019. 
​
Dodd-Frank Act: On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructured the financial regulatory environment in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all bank holding companies and banks, including Kentucky Bancshares and Kentucky Bank, some of which are described in more detail below.  The scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were determined and issued over time. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company has been substantial.  Provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and collection of interchange fees increased the costs associated with certain deposits and placed limitations on certain revenues those deposits generate.
​
Volcker Rule: On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making and hedging activities. U.S. banks will be restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. The Volcker Rule has not had a significant effect on operations of the Company. The roll-back of some Dodd-Frank provisions in 2018 included exempted smaller banks (under $10 billion in assets) from complying with the Volcker rule.
​
Consumer Regulations: In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, Kentucky Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits or making loans.
These laws also limit Kentucky Bank’s ability to share information with affiliated and unaffiliated entities. The bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing business operations.
​
Dividend Restrictions: There are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which the Company’s subsidiary bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also have the authority to prevent a bank or bank holding company from paying a dividend or engaging in any other activity that, in the opinion of the agency, would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Dividends paid by the subsidiary bank have provided substantially all of the Company’s operating funds, and this may reasonably be expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
​
COVID-19, The CARES Act and Related Legislative and Regulatory Actions: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constituted a public health emergency of international concern. On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and related governmental actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have significantly impacted the global economy (including the state and local economies in which we operate), disrupted supply chains, lowered equity market valuations and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try and contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted customer and business spending. While quarantine and lock-down orders have been lifted or reduced and vaccination efforts are underway, COVID-19 has not yet been entirely contained and commercial activity has not yet returned to the levels existing prior to the pandemic. As a result, the demand for some of the Company’s products and services has been, and will continue to be, significantly impacted.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law, providing an approximately $2 trillion stimulus package that included direct payments to individual taxpayers, economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors, emergency funding for hospitals and providers, small business loans, increased unemployment benefits, and a variety of tax incentives.
​
For small businesses, eligible nonprofits and certain others, the CARES Act established a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which is administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act was enacted. Among other things, this legislation amends the initial CARES Act program by raising the appropriation level for PPP loans from $349 billion to $670 billion. The PPP was further modified on June 5, 2020 with the adoption of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “Flexibility Act”), which extended the maturity date for PPP loans from two years to five years for loans disbursed on or after the date of enactment of the Flexibility Act. For PPP loans disbursed prior to such enactment, the Flexibility Act permits the borrower and lender to mutually agree to extend the term of the loan to five years. The vast majority of the Company’s PPP loans have two-year maturities. PPP loans earn interest at a fixed rate of 1% and are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Company anticipates that the majority of the PPP loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As discussed below under “The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act,” an additional $284 billion in funding has been made available under the PPP, with authority to make loans under the program being extended through March 31, 2021. During 2021, Kentucky Bank plans to offer additional PPP loans as authorized under the CAA (as defined below).
​
On April 7, 2020, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC” and, together with the FRB and OCC, the “federal banking regulators”) issued a revised Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions, which, among other things, encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19, and stated that institutions generally do not need to categorize COVID-19-related modifications as troubled debt restructurings and that the agencies will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings. Similarly, under the CARES Act, provisions were included that allow for loan modifications to not be classified as TDRs if certain criteria are met. This TDR exemption, which was set to expire on December 31, 2020, was extended under the CAA to the earlier of (i) 60 days after the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak terminates, and (ii) January 1, 2022.
​
The CARES Act, the CAA and certain actions by federal banking regulators have resulted in modifications to, or delays in implementation of, various regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations. See “Capital Requirements” above for additional information. 
​
On December 27, 2020, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package, as passed by the U.S. Congress, was signed into law as part of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”). In addition to providing direct stimulus payments to certain individuals, an increase in unemployment insurance benefits, an extension of the eviction moratorium, relief to the healthcare industry, and additional aid to various other businesses, the COVID-19-related provisions of the CAA also (i) established an additional $284 billion in funding for the PPP through March 31, 2021, and (ii) further suspended the exception for loan modifications to not be classified as TDRs if certain criteria are met.
