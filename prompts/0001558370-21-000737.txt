Distribution
​
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.
​
Resources
​
Human Capital
​
On December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 95,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 40,000 employed in the United States and 55,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3M’s success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.
​
Health and Safety
​
3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits. 
​
Development
​
Developing employees contributes to growing 3M’s business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the Company’s chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company has a suite of high-potential leadership development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3M also has development programs for managers and supervisors and provides learning opportunities for all employees. With the Company’s global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills. 
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
​
A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the Company’s diversity with underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates.
​
Compensation and Benefits
​
In addition to a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance, 3M’s total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, 

6



such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.
​
Raw Materials
​
In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged, 3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products, 3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.
​
The Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material price deflation in 2020. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.
​
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
​
The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 ​
The Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
​
Government Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance
​
The Company’s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.
​
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).
​
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
​
In 2020, 3M expended approximately $55 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality 

7



improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $400 million for 2021 and 2022 in aggregate.
​
Although an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
​

​
Item 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M’s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets. Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments.
​
As discussed in Note 19, 3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in “Elimination of Dual Credit”). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “Corporate and Unallocated”). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions. 
​
Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
​
Corporate and Unallocated:
​
In addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Additionally, Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes special items such as significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former drug delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
​
Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss decreased by $767 million in 2020 when compared to 2019. 
​
Special Items
Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section and Note 5 for additional details on the impact of significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions that are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.
 ​
Other Corporate Expense - Net
Other corporate operating expenses increased in 2020. The increases were due to year-over-year increased net costs as a result of the regular review of 3M’s respirator mask liabilities, lower year-on-year gains from certain property sales reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, in addition to transition service and other arrangement costs, net of income, post-divestiture of the Company’s former drug delivery business in 2020, and increased legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower year-on-year non divestiture-related restructuring costs reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.

​
PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA
​
While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 2 and Note 19.
​

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”
​
​
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
​
Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
​
The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, pension and postretirement obligations, goodwill and certain long-lived assets, and uncertainty in income tax positions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.
​
Legal Proceedings:
​
Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, Contingencies. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.
​
Pension and Postretirement Obligations:
​
The Company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations. 
​
The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a 

40



portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
​
Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-------------------------------------------+---+------------------------+---+------------------------------------------+---+-----------------------------+--
​ | ​ | U.S. Qualified Pension | | International Pension (weighted average) | | U.S. Postretirement Medical | ​
December 31, 2020 Liability: | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Benefit obligation | ​ | 2.55 | % | 1.38 | % | 2.35 | %
2021 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components: | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Service cost | ​ | 2.84 | % | 1.23 | % | 2.71 | %
Interest cost | ​ | 1.93 | % | 1.13 | % | 1.68 | %

​
Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%, a decrease from 6.75% in 2020. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 4.36% for 2021 compared to 4.70% for 2020. Refer to Note 13 for information on how the 2020 rates were determined.
​
3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures in determining the fair value of plan assets within the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. While the Company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $456 million and a benefit of $50 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $406 million, up from $357 million in 2019. 
​
In 2021, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $497 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $130 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $367 million, a decrease of approximately $40 million compared to 2020.
​
The table below summarizes the impact on 2021 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2020 net periodic benefit cost. The table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves.

Goodwill and Certain Long-Lived Assets:
​
The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. Those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.
​
Acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets
​
In conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the Company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. The fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.
​
Assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill
​
As of December 31, 2020, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.4 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $5.8 billion, of which $0.7 billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. In addition, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Long-lived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 
Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.
​
As of December 31, 2020, the $0.7 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to Capital Safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 60 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. In the first quarter of 2020, 3M reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinite-lived assets in 2020. Based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2020, no additional impairment was indicated. 
​
3M goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units 

42



within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. Where applicable, 3M uses a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.
​
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. In conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3M completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment structure. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
​
Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2020, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2020, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 93 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.
​
3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. 
​
3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2021 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
​
Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:
​
The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
​
The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Organic investments will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio to maximize value for shareholders. Given uncertainty arising from COVID-19, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program effective March 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans. 3M will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and plans to resume share repurchases in 2021. 3M maintains strong liquidity and further added to its liquidity position through the issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes in March 2020. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
​
3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2020, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.
​
Total Debt:
​
The strength of 3M’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor’s.
​
The Company’s total debt was $1.5 billion lower at December 31, 2020 when compared to December 31, 2019. Decreases in debt are further described in Note 12 and include the repayment of aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes subject to in-substance defeasance, 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured, the December 2020 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes related to make-whole-call offers, lower commercial paper balance, and the repayment of the 80 billion Japanese yen and 150 million euro credit facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.
​
In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR’s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments and continues to evaluate commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. 3M will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period.
​
Effective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.
​
As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Additionally, the August 2019 and March 2020 debt was issued under the WKSI shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.

The Company has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in November 2020 with an expiration date of November 2021. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans with a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2020. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2020, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
​
Apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in September 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility initially expiring in July 2020 that was further extended to August 2021 in the amount of 80 billion Japanese yen. In November 2019, 3M entered into a credit facility expiring in November 2020 in the amount of 150 million euros. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities. The Company also had $273 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
​
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:
​
At December 31, 2020, 3M had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2019, 3M had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.4 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the United States. The increase from December 31, 2019 primarily resulted from strong cash flow from operations, reduced capital expenditures, and lower share repurchases. 
​
Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):
​
Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

​
Balance Sheet:
​
3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
​
The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.
​

Working Capital (non-GAAP measure):

Working capital (non-GAAP measure) | ​ | $ | 7,034 | ​ | $ | 3,749 | ​ | $ | 3,285 | ​

​
Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. 
​
Working capital increased $3.3 billion compared with December 31, 2019. Balance changes in current assets increased working capital by $2.0 billion, driven by increases in cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable. Balance changes in current liabilities increased working capital by $1.3 billion, primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowing and the current portion of long-term debt. 
​
Accounts receivable decreased $86 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to ongoing collection management and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables related to COVID-19 uncertainty. Inventory increased $105 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of foreign currency impacts. These increases were partially offset by inventory decreases as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business.
​
Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):
​
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.
​
​

46



In 2020, ROIC of 18.2 percent was higher than 2019. The increase was driven by the lower year-over-year impact of significant litigation-related charges in addition to the non-repeating charge from the 2019 deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuela subsidiary. 2019 ROIC was also negatively impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of Acelity.

​
Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.
​
In 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion compared to the same period last year, with this increase primarily due to cost saving actions taken in response to COVID-19 and lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable improved operating cash flow by $326 million in 2020, compared to an operating cash flow improvement of $598 million in 2019. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.

​
Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2020, 3M reduced overall spending in light of uncertainty regarding COVID-19, but continued to invest in expanding the Company’s ability to increase production of respiratory products to meet worldwide demand. The Company expects 2021 capital spending to be approximately $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.
​
3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.
​
3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.

48



Refer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2020 primarily relate to the payment made for contingent consideration in regards to the Acelity acquisition. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2020 primarily relate to the sales of the Company’s advanced ballistic-protection business and its drug delivery business. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2019 primarily include the purchase of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2019 primarily relate to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business and the gas and flame detection business.
​
Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. In 2020 these included the maturity of the held-to-maturity debt security that was purchased to satisfy the redemption of the Third Lien Notes (which matured in May 2020). Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities.

2020 Debt Activity: 
​
Total debt was approximately $18.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $20.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the aggregate $445 million principal amount of Third Lien Notes and the 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured in May 2020 and August 2020, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company paid the outstanding balances on their Japanese yen and euro credit facilities. In addition, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes maturing in September 2021 were repaid in December 2020 via make-whole-call offers. Increases in debt were related to the March 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes. There was no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2020, as compared to $150 million at December 31, 2019. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.
​
2019 Debt Activity:
​
Total debt was approximately $5.7 billion higher at December 31, 2019 when compared to December 31, 2018. Increases in debt related to the first quarter and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, 69 billion Japanese yen (approximately $632 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion Japanese yen credit facility established in September 2019, 150 million euros (approximately $168 million at December 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in November 2019, and $0.5 billion of debt assumed and not yet repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Acelity Inc. Repayment of debt primarily consists of the June 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that had matured, in addition to debt assumed and subsequently repaid as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of M*Modal and Acelity Inc. as discussed in Note 3. Outstanding commercial paper decreased $285 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.
​

Repurchases of Common Stock:
​
Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2020, the Company purchased $0.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained available under the authorization. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with other repurchase activity limited to 3M’s stock compensation plans. The Company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.
​
Dividends Paid to Shareholders:
​
Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $3.388 billion ($5.88 per share) in 2020, $3.316 billion ($5.76 per share) in 2019, and $3.193 billion ($5.44 per share) in 2018. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2021, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.92 per share and marked the 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases.
​
Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.
​
Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):
​
Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. 
​
Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” and “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” sections for discussion of items that impacted the operating cash flow and purchases of PP&E components of the calculation of free cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Results of Operations” section for discussion of items that impacted the net income attributable to 3M component of the calculation of free cash flow conversion.
​
​

50



Free cash flow conversion grew to 123% in 2020 compared to 118% in 2019 as increases in free cash flow out-paced increases in net income attributable to 3M.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:
​
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 16 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
​
In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

​
As a result of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments, long-term debt payments due in 2021 include floating rate notes totaling $53 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt).
​
In conjunction with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has a transition tax liability that is payable over 8 years beginning in 2018. See Note 10 for additional details.
​
Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with 

51



terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
​
Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months, when applicable. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $933 million is excluded from the preceding table. In addition, the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is separately included in the table above. Refer to Note 10 for further details. Additionally, included within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other” are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of December 31, 2020, totaled approximately $18 million. These commitments pertain to 3M’s right of use buildings.
​
As discussed in Note 13, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2021 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.
​
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
​
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.
​
Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.
