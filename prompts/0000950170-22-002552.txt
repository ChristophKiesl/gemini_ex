Note on the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global economies, financial markets, business practices and societies. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments on our business, operations and financial performance. Our focus remains on continuing to advance our efforts with respect to the commercialization of TAZVERIK® and to continue to advance the development of our pipeline, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on sales of TAZERIK and the initiation of clinical trials since the June 2020 FDA approval of TAZVERIK for follicular lymphoma, or FL. Due to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that this pandemic has had on our business, operations and financial performance to date or the impact that this pandemic will have in 2022 and beyond. Please see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the impact and the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial performance.
 Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing targeted medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action directed at specific causes of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
We have one approved product, TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), which was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and FL. Our focus is on maximizing our effectiveness as a commercial organization to achieve adoption of TAZVERIK among as many appropriate patients as possible, including in earlier treatment lines and in combination regimens with the data to support this expanded use; building on TAZVERIK’s pipeline-in-a-drug potential; and expanding our pipeline and evolving oncology portfolio, including with SET-101, our first-in-human Phase 1/1b trial of EZM0414, our novel, first-in-class, oral SETD2 inhibitor. We are leveraging our drug discovery platform and expertise as a leader in epigenetics, as well as our team’s deep experience across clinical development and commercialization to execute on our strategy.
 In January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), an oral, first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the ES cohort of our Phase 2 trial in patients with INI1-negative tumors. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
As part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a single, randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial in the United States (EZH-301) assessing tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 patients. We have completed the planned enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial is open for accrual. We reported safety and preliminary activity data from the patients in the safety run-in portion of the EZH-301 trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2021.
In June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and adult patients with R/R FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with

a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
As part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these R/R FL indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial (EZH-302, SYMPHONY-1) assessing the combination of tazemetostat with “R2” (lenalidomide and rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for R/R FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and also conduct post-marketing commitments to expand the TAZVERIK label into the second-line treatment setting.
In December 2021 we presented updated safety and activity data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of this confirmatory trial at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. We continue to follow the 40 patients in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and we expect to present follow-up data from the safety run-in portion of the trial at a medical conference later in 2022.
We expect that the Phase 3 portion of the SYMPHONY-1 trial will be a global, randomized and adaptive confirmatory trial in 500 patients. Based on the Phase 1b safety run-in results, in December 2021 we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA with 800 mg twice-daily as the recommended tazemetostat dose (RP3D) for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. After completing the 30-day voluntary waiting period following submission of the protocol amendment for 800 mg RP3D without any objection from the FDA, and as we continue to conduct the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, we have accelerated global start-up activities and are activating as many study sites as possible, globally, for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be based on progression free survival as determined by investigator. Based on discussions with the FDA, this portion of the trial will include two interim analyses, the first of which is for futility only and the second of which will be conducted for futility, and if 65% of progression free survival events have occurred, the trial will also include an efficacy evaluation. In July 2021 China’s Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, approved the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we filed in China for SYMPHONY-1. We are currently screening patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial and we expect to enroll the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of this trial in the first quarter of 2022.
 Through our planned development efforts, including the following trials, our intention is to eventually make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL.
•In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, LYSA is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL and DLBCL. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022.
 •In addition, we are finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.
 We are also developing tazemetostat for the treatment of a broad range of other cancer types in multiple treatment settings. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a “pipeline in a product” opportunity and plan to explore its potential utility in additional indications and combinations.
 There are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and are for patients suffering from diseases that would benefit from a new effective and safe treatment option, including:


•Lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, such as DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, multiple myeloma and others; 
 •Molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and tumors harboring an EZH2 or SWI/SNF alteration;
 •PARPi-resistant tumors, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and others; and 
 •Immuno-oncology sensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and others. 
 
As part of these broader tazemetostat development efforts, we are evaluating tazemetostat for the treatment of prostate cancer. We are conducting a global, multi-center, open-label, randomized Phase 1b/2 trial (EZH-1101, CELLO-1) evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone, the standard of care treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. As of February 2021, we had completed enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of CELLO-1 with a total of 21 men with mCRPC. In September 2021, at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, we announced preliminary data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial with a data cutoff date of July 22, 2021. We continue to follow patients from the Phase 1b portion of the study, and we expect to present updated data from these patients in the second half of 2022. Based on early safety and activity findings observed in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of CELLO-1, in the first quarter of 2021 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 2 efficacy portion of CELLO-1 evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide alone, and we expect to include 80 men with mCRPC in this Phase 2 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for CELLO-1 is radiographic progression free survival. The Phase 2 efficacy portion of the trial is approximately 75% enrolled toward the target of 80 patients, and we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2022. We plan to provide updated data from the safety run-in portion of the trial as well as interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
 To efficiently evaluate tazemetostat’s potential safety and efficacy across multiple types of hematological malignancies, we initiated a signal-finding Phase 1b/2 basket study (EZH-1501) evaluating tazemetostat with multiple combinations in hematological malignancies in December 2021 and we are actively screening patients for enrollment in this study. In the conduct of EZH-1501, we plan to study multiple combinations with standard of care therapies and novel mechanisms of action as we seek to expand the potential of TAZVERIK to patients with hematological malignancies and the physicians who treat them. We plan to provide updates as EZH-1501 reaches key enrollment milestones and we plan to provide preliminary data from EZH-1501 in the second half of 2022.
On March 1, 2022, we announced a pipeline reprioritization. Given the breadth of our current tazemetostat clinical development program, we have discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 study of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings (SYMPHONY-2, EZH-1401), as well as in our Phase 1/1b basket study evaluating tazemetostat combinations in patients with solid tumors (EZH-1301). We have enrolled five patients in the EZH-1401 study and one patient in the EZH-1301 study and plan to continue to follow the patients currently enrolled in each of these two studies. The decision to discontinue these studies was based on evolving market dynamics and a continued focus on optimizing our investments and eliminating potentially overlapping studies. We continue to study tazemetostat in combination with other therapies for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, both in ongoing Company-sponsored studies as well as investigator-initiated studies.
 We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan and greater China. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, holds certain rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in greater China.
TAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the approved ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities.


On August 7, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration pursuant to a license agreement with HutchMed through which we granted a license to HutchMed for the co-exclusive (with us) development and exclusive commercialization of tazemetostat, either as monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by us and HutchMed for the treatment of ES, FL and DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed to by us and HutchMed in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or the HutchMed Territory.
 For other geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to obtain marketing approval, commercialize and distribute TAZVERIK to reach patients, including pursuing potential strategic collaborations. Based on comparators and the regulatory landscape, we have decided not to pursue marketing approval of tazemetostat as monotherapy from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA at this time.
Tazemetostat is covered by claims of U.S. and European composition of matter patents, which are expected to expire in 2032, exclusive of any patent term or other extensions. Tazemetostat has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in patients with relapsed or refractory FL, relapsed or refractory DLBCL with EZH2 activating mutations and metastatic or locally advanced ES who have progressed on or following an anthracycline-based treatment regimen. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, and mesothelioma, and a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period from the dates of our respective approvals of TAZVERIK for the treatment of patients with ES and for the treatment of patients with FL.
Beyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs, including HMTs, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases.
Our most advanced product candidate, EZM0414, is a novel first-in-class oral inhibitor of the SETD2 HMT.
 SETD2 is an HMT that plays multiple important roles in oncogenesis. Based on the potential of SETD2 inhibition demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings, including multiple myeloma, and in particular high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma and in other B-cell malignancies such as DLBCL, as well as in combination with existing and emerging therapies including tazemetostat, we submitted an IND for EZM0414 to the FDA in July 2021. We received “study may proceed” from the FDA with respect to our IND for EZM0414 in July 2021. In October 2021, EZM0414 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in January 2022 we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for EZM0414 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/1b trial (SET-101) intended to evaluate the safety and optimize the dose and schedule of EZM0414 in R/R multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients. The Phase 1 portion of our SET-101 trial is a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and includes six planned dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg once daily. Once we have optimized the dose, we then expect to expand the trial to two patient cohorts in multiple myeloma: t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Based on dose optimization data from the trial, we may add a third patient cohort in DLBCL. We are screening patients with one site open for the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the SET-101 trial, which we expect will enroll between 30-36 patients. We plan to provide updates as the trial reaches key enrollment milestones along with preliminary data from the trial in 2022.
To date we have entered into various strategic collaborations, including with Eisai, HutchMed, Roche and other third parties. As one of several key aspects of our strategy, we plan to continue to leverage our existing collaborations and to seek to identify new potential strategic collaborations to further support and grow our business in and outside of the United States.
 Our Corporate Strategy
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer through the discovery, development and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing targeted medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action directed at specific causes of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
Our corporate strategy is focused on four critical imperatives that we refer to as The Next EPIsode: Rewriting Oncology Treatment with Epigenetics:

 • Build on TAZVERIK’s pipeline-in-a-drug potential, demonstrating tazemetostat’s benefit in additional hematological malignancies and solid tumors; 
 • Expand our pipeline and evolving oncology portfolio, bringing novel oncology therapeutics into clinical development to maintain our position as a leader in epigenetics; and 
 •Leverage options to expand patient reach, including through commercial, clinical and research collaborations. 
 
TAZVERIK (tazemetostat) for Epithelioid Sarcoma
In January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat) for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in an open-label, single-arm cohort of a multi-cohort, global Phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in adults with INI1-negative tumors. The cohort was conducted in 62 patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or locally advanced ES. Patients were required to have INI1 loss, detected using local tests, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, or ECOG PS, of 0-2. Patients in the cohort received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate, or ORR, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, v1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review, and duration of response. Median duration of follow-up was 14 months (range 0.4 to 31).
 Among the 62 patients who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 34 years (range 16 to 79); 63% were male, 76% were White, 11% were Asian, 44% had proximal disease, 92% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and 8% had an ECOG PS of 2. Prior surgery occurred in 77% of patients; 61% received prior systemic chemotherapy.
 In the total of 62 patients treated, the overall response rate (95% confidence interval) was 15% (7%, 26%), with 1.6% of patients achieving a complete response and 13% achieving a partial response. Among responders in the trial, 67% had a duration of response of six months or longer as of the data cutoff date of September 17, 2018.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients receiving TAZVERIK. The serious adverse reactions in ≥3% of patients who received TAZVERIK were hemorrhage, pleural effusion, skin infection, dyspnea, pain, and respiratory distress.
 One patient (2%) permanently discontinued TAZVERIK due to an adverse reaction of altered mood.
 Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients who received TAZVERIK. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions in ≥3% of patients were hemorrhage, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Dose reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in one (2%) patient who received TAZVERIK due to decreased appetite.
 The most common adverse reactions (≥20%, any grade) were pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation.
 The label for TAZVERIK includes warning and precautions for the increase in risk of developing secondary malignancies following treatment with TAZVERIK and the risk of embryo fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women.
 The Lancet Oncology published results of our Phase 2 trial evaluating TAZVERIK for the treatment of ES in October 2020.
 We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.


Background on ES: Epithelioid sarcoma is an ultra-rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma, comprising less than 1 percent of all soft tissue sarcoma cases, and is characterized by a loss of the INI1 protein. It is most commonly diagnosed in young adults (20-40 years old) and is often fatal. There is no established standard-of-care for treating these patients, who are typically resistant to chemotherapy. Patients diagnosed with metastatic disease typically have a 5-year overall survival rate of zero percent and there are no approved treatment options specifically indicated for ES other than TAZVERIK. Typically, once patients have been deemed appropriate for systemic therapy, most are treated with chemotherapy. There are an estimated 800 patients in the United States living with ES with approximately 300 patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease that are eligible for systemic therapy.
 TAZVERIK for Epithelioid Sarcoma Post-Marketing Requirements
Confirmatory Trial. As part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a 1:1 randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 clinical trial in the United States in the front-line treatment setting comparing tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin, a commonly used systemic treatment in this setting, versus placebo plus doxorubicin. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 ES patients. The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 3 portion of the trial is progression-free survival, and secondary efficacy endpoints include overall survival, disease control rate, overall response rate, duration of response and health-related quality of life. We have completed the planned enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial is open for accrual. We reported safety and preliminary activity data from patients in the safety run-in portion of the trial at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2021.

We have several additional post-marketing activities underway, intended to address aspects of the label in the future. These include clinical pharmacology evaluations to assess the effect of TAZVERIK on liver function and the effect of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on TAZVERIK for patients with ES. We have also expanded enrollment in a cohort of our Phase 2 study in adults with INI1-negative tumors, to enroll a total of at least 60 ES patients. The cohort is a paired biopsy cohort designed to assess potential immune biomarkers, and the expansion is intended to provide more experience in patients with ES.
 TAZVERIK for Follicular Lymphoma
 In June 2020, the FDA approved an sNDA for TAZVERIK for the following FL indications: (1) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and (2) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2.
TAZVERIK was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with histologically confirmed FL whose disease had progressed following at least two prior systemic treatment regimens. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts: one cohort enrolled 45 patients with EZH2 activating mutations and a second cohort enrolled 54 patients with wild-type EZH2. All patients were treated with 800 mg of tazemetostat, administered orally twice a day. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) according to the International Working Group Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (IWG-NHL) criteria (Cheson 2007) as assessed by Independent Review Committee. Median duration of follow-up was 22 months for patients with EZH2 activating mutations and 36 months for patients with wild-type EZH2.
 Among the 45 FL patients with an EZH2 activating mutation who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 62 years (range 38 to 80); 42% were male; 42% had early progression following front-line therapy (POD24); and all had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 2.0 (range 1 to 11); 49% were refractory to rituximab and 49% were refractory to their last therapy. In the 42 patients treated with at least two prior systemic therapies, the ORR (95% confidence interval) was 69% (53%, 82%), with 12% of patients achieving a complete response and 57% achieving a partial response. The median DOR was 10.9 months and ongoing.


Among the 54 FL patients with wild-type EZH2 who received TAZVERIK, the median age was 61 years (range 36 to 87); 63% were male; 59% had POD24; and 91% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 3.0 (range 1 to 8); 59% were refractory to rituximab and 41% were refractory to their last therapy. In the 53 patients treated with at least two prior systemic therapies, the ORR (95% confidence interval) was 34% (22%, 48%), with 4% of patients achieving a complete response and 30% achieving a partial response. The median DOR was 13.0 months.
 Serious adverse reactions, irrespective of attribution, occurred in 30% of patients receiving TAZVERIK. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TAZVERIK were general physical health deterioration, abdominal pain, pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, nausea and abdominal pain.
 Eight patients (8%) discontinued due to adverse reaction during the trial. There were no reported deaths on study, and no black box warnings or contraindications.
 The Lancet Oncology published in October 2020 results of our Phase 2 trial evaluating TAZVERIK for the treatment of FL.
 We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.
 Background on FL: Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent lymphoma and the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma – accounting for about 10-20% of all lymphomas in Western countries. FL is considered to be incurable with existing treatments and is characterized by cycles of relapse that become increasingly difficult to treat with each disease progression. We estimate that approximately 14,000 patients are diagnosed with FL in the United States annually, of whom the majority have advanced disease at diagnosis. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease in the United States. Based on literature and an extensive natural history study that we conducted, we believe that approximately 20% of FL tumors carry an EZH2 activating mutation. Common treatments for FL include multi-agent chemotherapy, usually combined with rituximab (Rituxan), including R-CHOP and R-Bendamustine. Upon clinical progression, treatment regimens are typically other combinations of rituximab, and other chemotherapy regimens, utilization of off-label agents, clinical trials, or one of the two approved PI3k inhibitors: copanlisib or umbralisib, or one approved CAR-T therapy: YESCARTA.
 TAZVERIK for Follicular Lymphoma Post-Marketing Requirements
 As part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial (EZH-302, SYMPHONY-1) assessing the combination of tazemetostat with “R2” (lenalidomide plus rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting.
In December 2021 we presented updated safety and activity data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of this confirmatory trial at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting, which included 40 FL patients who had received treatment with tazemetostat and R2, including patients at the 400 mg tazemetostat twice daily dosing regimen [n=4], the 600 mg tazemetostat twice daily dosing regimen [n=18] and the 800 mg tazemetostat twice daily dosing regimen [n=18], as of a September 29, 2021 data cutoff date. Through the September 29, 2021 data cutoff date, the safety profile observed in the patients in the 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg dose cohorts was consistent with safety information in the prescribing information for the individual tazemetostat and R2 package inserts, respectively. Additionally, there was no clear dose response for treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, or dose modifications. Thirty-five (35) of the 40 patients were evaluable for tumor assessments as of the data cutoff date. Thirty-two (32) patients responded to treatment, with 13 patients, or 37.1 percent, having a complete response, and 19 patients, or 54.3 percent, having a partial response, for an overall response rate of 91.4 percent. The duration of response data continue to mature as the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial is ongoing. We continue to follow the 40 patients in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial and we expect to present follow-up data from the safety run-in portion of the trial at a medical conference later in 2022.

We expect that the Phase 3 portion of the SYMPHONY-1 trial will be a global, randomized and adaptive confirmatory trial in approximately 500 FL patients, stratified based on their EZH2 mutation status. Based on the Phase 1b safety run-in results, in December 2021 we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA with 800 mg twice-daily as the recommended tazemetostat dose for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. After completing the 30-day voluntary waiting period following submission of the protocol amendment for the 800 mg RP3D without any objection from the FDA, and as we continue to conduct the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, we have accelerated global start-up activities and are activating as many study sites as possible, globally, for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be based on progression free survival as determined by investigator. Based on discussions with the FDA, this portion of the trial will include two interim analyses, the first of which is for futility only and the second of which will be conducted for futility, and if 65% of progression free survival events have occurred, the trial will also include an efficacy evaluation. In July 2021 China’s Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, approved the IND we filed in China for SYMPHONY-1. We are currently screening patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial and we expect to enroll the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of this trial in the first quarter of 2022.
 In addition, we continue to engage with the FDA regarding the conduct of additional post-marketing commitments, including with respect to the design of clinical trials in FL patients with wild-type EZH2 to evaluate tazemetostat as a monotherapy in patients who have been treated with at least one prior systemic treatment, in order to inform the label and potentially expand in the relapsed and refractory setting in the future.
FL Development Expansion: Through our planned development efforts, our intention is to make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and post-marketing commitments to expand TAZVERIK into the second-line treatment setting.
In collaboration with LYSA and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in a combination Phase 1b/2 study with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk DLBCL, in the fourth quarter of 2016 LYSA commenced a multi-center Phase 1b/2 trial of tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP in front-line, elderly high-risk patients with DLBCL. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints include ORR and progression-free survival, or PFS. At ASH 2018, LYSA reported interim data from 17 patients in the trial as of March 2018 showing that the combination of the two agents had been generally well-tolerated and confirming the recommended tazemetostat dose for the combination to be 800 mg twice-daily. Clinical activity was observed, with 87 percent of patients experiencing a metabolic complete response. We agreed in 2020 to expand the trial to also include an expansion cohort for the front-line treatment of high-risk patients with FL. The Phase 1b part of the study has completed. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022.
 In addition, we are finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.
Tazemetostat Life-Cycle Development
Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a “pipeline in a product” opportunity and plan to explore its utility in additional indications and combinations through both Company- and investigator-sponsored studies. There are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and are for patients suffering from diseases that would benefit from a new effective and safe treatment option.
 Lymphomas and B-Cell Malignancies
 We are developing tazemetostat for lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, MCL, multiple myeloma and others, because of the role EZH2 plays in B-cell biology. When oncogenic mutations occur, they can “lock” B-cells in the germinal center state, leading to a variety of hematologic cancers. Regardless of the oncogenic mutation, these cancer cells are governed by EZH2 expression, which enables their growth and proliferation. By inhibiting EZH2, we believe we can inhibit tumor proliferation, leading to anti-tumor activity, as seen in FL patients with wild-type EZH2.


Molecularly Defined Solid Tumors
We are exploring the use of tazemetostat to treat multiple molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma and tumors with a SWI/SNF alteration or other mutations. In these tumors, a loss of certain proteins or the presence of a certain mutation have been shown to result in abnormal EZH2 activity or exaggerated dependence on EZH2, which typically leads to cancer cell growth. By inhibiting EZH2 with tazemetostat, we believe we can inhibit that abnormal function, thereby indirectly restoring cells to their natural state, which we believe has the potential to result in a therapeutic benefit.
 PARPi-Resistant Tumors
 We are assessing the use of tazemetostat for PARPi-resistant solid tumors that are resistant to chemotherapy or other treatments, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and others. EZH2 plays a role in the resistance to poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors. When PARP inhibitors are given, DNA is damaged, which leads to increased EZH2 activity and limits the responsiveness to the PARP inhibitor. By blocking EZH2 with tazemetostat, we believe we can also re-sensitize tumors to PARP inhibition treatment.
 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed and second most frequent cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. We believe that treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor after resistance to the standards-of-care may result in recovery of sensitivity to these agents because, based on published literature, EZH2 protein expression has been correlated with progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, and moderate to high EZH2 expression has been associated with worse survival. We are conducting a global, multi-center, randomized Phase 1b/2 trial (EZH-1101, CELLO-1) evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone, the standard of care treatments for mCRPC. As of February 2021, we had completed enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of CELLO-1 with a total of 21 men with mCRPC. Based on early safety and activity findings observed in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of CELLO-1, in the first quarter of 2021 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 2 efficacy portion of CELLO-1 evaluating tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide alone, and we expect to include 80 men with mCRPC in this Phase 2 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for CELLO-1 is radiographic progression free survival. The Phase 2 efficacy portion of the trial is approximately 75% enrolled toward the target of 80 patients, and we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2022. We plan to provide updated data from the safety run-in portion of the trial as well as interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.
 In September 2021, at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, we announced preliminary data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial using a data cutoff date of July 22, 2021. The safety run-in portion of CELLO-1 is being conducted using a standard dose escalation design. Among the 21 patients enrolled in the safety run-in portion, as of the data cutoff date no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, were observed at any dose of tazemetostat up to a maximum dose of 1600 mg twice daily for patients receiving tazemetostat plus enzalutamide and 800 mg twice daily for patients receiving tazemetostat plus abiraterone. As of the July 22, 2021 cutoff date, preliminary data from the trial also showed:
•Median PFS had not been reached at cutoff for the tazemetostat plus enzalutamide arm; six-month PFS was 61.7%. 
 •11 of 21 patients experienced prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, decline from baseline; seven out of 21 patients had a PSA response of ≥50%; one additional patient had a PSA response of ≥30%.
 •Six of the PSA50 responses were in the tazemetostat + enzalutamide cohort (n=13) and one was in the tazemetostat + abiraterone/prednisone cohort (n=8).
 •One patient with a PSA50 response achieved a radiographic partial response. 
 •All PSA50 and PSA30 responses were in ARV7 negative and neuroendocrine subtype negative patients identified using the EPIC platform. Only one ARV7 positive patient was enrolled in the safety run-in portion of the trial.
 
PARP-Resistant Solid Tumors: We are continuing with an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial that is intended to investigate the therapeutic potential of tazemetostat as a combination therapy with a PARP inhibitor for the

treatment of PARP-resistant tumors. In PARP-resistant cancers, PARP inhibitors have shown modest monotherapy activity, and we continue to believe tazemetostat may have the potential to enhance the clinical response to PARP inhibitors.
 Immuno-oncology-sensitive Tumors
 We are assessing the use of tazemetostat for immuno-oncology-sensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and others. We believe tazemetostat has the potential to enhance the antitumor immune response by interfering with multiple EZH2 functions in the cell. EZH2 inhibition results in tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic effects that reshape the tumor microenvironment to favor antitumor immunity, including increasing antigen presentation, increasing effector T cell trafficking, modulating the adaptive anti-tumor response, impairing regulatory T cells, inducing the expression of tumor antigens and endogenous retroviruses, and increasing NK cell maturation and killing. By inhibiting EZH2, we believe tazemetostat may be able to influence biologic activity in the tumor microenvironment, which could enable tumors to be more sensitive or re-sensitized to immune-oncology therapies.
EZM0414, Our SETD2 Inhibitor Program and SET-101, Our Phase 1/1b Trial of EZM0414
We are developing a novel first-in-class oral inhibitor of SETD2 (EZM0414). SETD2 is an HMT that plays multiple important roles in oncogenesis. We submitted an IND for EZM0414 to the FDA in July 2021 based on the potential of SETD2 inhibition demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings, including multiple myeloma, and in particular high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma and in other B-cell malignancies such as DLBCL, as well as in combination with existing and emerging therapies including tazemetostat.
We received “study may proceed” from the FDA with respect to our IND for EZM0414 in July 2021. In October 2021, EZM0414 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in January 2022 we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for EZM0414 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. This trial (SET-101), which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, is a Phase 1/1b trial intended to evaluate the safety and optimize the dose and schedule of EZM0414 in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients. The Phase 1 portion of our SET-101 trial is a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and includes six planned dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg once daily. Once we have optimized the dose, we then expect to expand the trial to two patient cohorts in multiple myeloma: t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Based on dose optimization data from the trial, we may add a third patient cohort in DLBCL. We are screening patients with one site open for the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the SET-101 trial, which we expect will enroll between 30-36 patients. We plan to provide updates as the trial reaches key enrollment milestones, along with preliminary data from the trial in 2022.
 Our Research Focus
Beyond tazemetostat and EZM0414, we are utilizing our proprietary drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of CMPs, including HMTs, HATs, and helicases. These programs are directed against both hematological malignancies and solid tumors and include biomarker approaches to patient stratification.
 Our Epigenetic Approach
Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression without altering the sequence of the genes themselves. Genes are composed of DNA, and in nature, this DNA is wrapped around a core of proteins known as histones. Together, the DNA and histone proteins form a complex known as chromatin that is the basic structural component of chromosomes.
Gene regulation is determined by chromatin structure. The dynamics of chromatin structure are regulated through multiple mechanisms by CMPs. Some CMPs place chemical groups onto specific sites on histones or DNA, some remove these marks in site-specific ways, others recognize the uniquely marked sites on histones and bind to these marked sites, and still other CMPs drive topological changes to histone-DNA interactions within chromatin. Where, when and how such chromatin structure changes occur determines which genes in a cell are turned “on” or “off” at

any particular time. When the function of these CMPs is altered, the program of gene expression is changed in ways that can lead to disease.
To further support our leadership position in epigenetics, we are discovering and developing inhibitors of CMPs as novel therapeutics for patients with cancer. Our focus is on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule inhibitors of CMPs for applications in diseases that are uniquely dependent on the enzyme activity of a specific CMP. Among the CMP target classes, we have had a particular emphasis on the HMTs, which have been shown to play pathogenic roles in a number of human diseases. Today, we have programs in HMTs as well as additional target classes, including HATs, and helicases. We believe that targeting pathogenic CMPs affords us multiple opportunities to create, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics.
 Our Collaborations
We have entered into several key strategic collaborations, including therapeutic collaborations and other collaborations. Since our inception, the therapeutic collaborations have provided us with $268.8 million in non-equity funding through December 31, 2021. Key terms of our ongoing collaborations are summarized below.
Eisai
Overview. In March 2015, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai, under which we reacquired worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to our EZH2 program, including tazemetostat. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, we will be responsible for global development, manufacturing and commercialization outside of Japan of tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates, with Eisai retaining development and commercialization rights in Japan, as well as a right to elect to manufacture tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates in Japan, including the right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia. Eisai waived its right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia in 2018. Under the original collaboration and license agreement, we had granted Eisai an exclusive worldwide license to our small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, including tazemetostat, while retaining an opt-in right to co-develop, co-commercialize and share profits with Eisai as to licensed products in the United States.
Upon the execution of the amended and restated collaboration agreement in March 2015, we agreed to pay Eisai a $40.0 million upfront payment. We also agreed to pay Eisai up to $20.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, including a $10.0 million milestone payment upon the earlier of initiation of a first phase 3 clinical trial of any EZH2 product or the first submission of an NDA or Market Authorization Application, or MAA, and a $10.0 million milestone upon the earlier of initiation of a first phase 3 clinical trial of any EZH2 product or the first submission of an NDA or MAA for a second indication, and up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestone payments, including a $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of the first NDA or MAA, and a $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of the NDA or MAA for the second indication. We are obligated to pay royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on worldwide net sales of any EZH2 product, excluding net sales in Japan. In 2019, Eisai sold its rights to these royalties to RPI Finance Trust, which has agreed to certain reductions in these royalties in the event certain net sales thresholds are achieved. We are eligible to receive from Eisai royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on net sales of any EZH2 product in Japan. In November 2019, we sold our rights to these royalties to RPI Finance Trust. In 2019, we triggered the payment of the two $10.0 million milestone payments upon the submission of the NDAs for accelerated approval of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. In January 2020, we triggered the payment of the $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval in the United States of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma and in June 2020 we triggered the payment of an additional $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval in the United States of tazemetostat for follicular lymphoma.
 Under the original agreement, Eisai was solely responsible for funding all research, development and commercialization costs for licensed compounds. Under the amended and restated agreement, we are solely responsible for funding global development, manufacturing and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds outside of Japan, and Eisai is solely responsible for funding Japan-specific development and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds. In connection with the amended and restated agreement, we and Eisai agreed to the transition to us of ongoing development and manufacturing activities that were being conducted by or on behalf of Eisai. In January 2017, as part of Eisai’s obligations under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, Eisai

enrolled and dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 study of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL in Japan.
 In the event that we are awarded a priority review voucher from the FDA with respect to an EZH2 product, Eisai is entitled to specified compensation if we use the voucher on a non-EZH2 program or sell the voucher to a third party.
Governance. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, development will be guided by a joint steering committee, with our company retaining final decision-making authority with respect to global development other than with respect to Japan-specific development and commercialization.
Exclusivity Restrictions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, for an exclusivity period extending until eight years after the first commercial sale of a product covered by the agreement, neither we nor Eisai may research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, other than pursuant to the agreement.
Term and Termination. Our agreement with Eisai will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement with respect to all licensed products. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country commences on the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage, expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity or ten years following the first commercial sale. We or Eisai may terminate the agreement for convenience as to our respective territories, upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The agreement will also terminate as to our territory if we cease all development and commercialization activities for the United States and specified major countries in Europe and as to Eisai’s territory if Eisai ceases all development and commercialization activities for Japan. The agreement may also be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or by us in the event Eisai, or an affiliate or sublicensee, participates or actively assists in an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents. If we terminate the agreement for our convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of our cessation of development and commercialization activities or Eisai terminates the agreement for our uncured material breach, Eisai may elect to have worldwide development and commercialization rights revert to Eisai, and if Eisai so elects, Eisai will be required to pay us specified royalties on net sales of the licensed products and reimburse certain development expenses incurred by us. If Eisai terminates the agreement for its convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of Eisai’s cessation of development and commercialization activities or we terminate the agreement for Eisai’s uncured material breach or Eisai’s, or its affiliate’s or sublicensee’s, participation in, or assistance with, an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents, Japanese development and commercialization rights to the licensed products revert to us, and we will be required to pay Eisai specified royalties on net sales of licensed products in Japan.
HutchMed
 Overview. In August 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration pursuant to a license agreement, or the HutchMed License Agreement, with HutchMed for the development, manufacture and commercialization of tazemetostat, either as a monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by the parties under the HutchMed License Agreement for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed by the parties in accordance with the terms of the HutchMed License Agreement in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, each a Jurisdiction and collectively, the HutchMed Territory.
 
We have granted HutchMed licenses under patent rights and know-how that we control to enable HutchMed to develop and commercialize licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory. The licenses granted to HutchMed are co-exclusive with us with respect to the development of licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory and exclusive with respect to the commercialization of licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory. We also granted HutchMed a license under patent rights and know-how controlled that we control to enable HutchMed to manufacture tazemetostat drug substance and drug product for the purpose of developing and commercializing licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory. We retain development and commercialization rights with respect to licensed products in the rest of the world outside of the HutchMed Territory except for Japan. During the term of the

HutchMed License Agreement, each party and its affiliates is prohibited from developing or commercializing any other compound or product that inhibits, modulates or degrades EZH1, EZH2, or any other member of the polycomb repressive complex 2, including the EED protein for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory, provided that, subject to limitations specified in the HutchMed License Agreement, HutchMed may develop its existing preclinical compound that inhibits EZH1 and EZH2 without the use of know-how or patent rights that we licensed to HutchMed.

We have agreed to conduct a technology transfer of manufacturing technology to HutchMed to enable HutchMed to manufacture clinical and commercial quantities of tazemetostat drug substance and drug product to carry out its obligations and exercise its rights under the HutchMed License Agreement. Subject to the execution of a clinical supply agreement or commercial supply agreement, as applicable, and until the completion of the technology transfer to HutchMed, we have agreed to manufacture and supply HutchMed with tazemetostat drug substance and drug product in sufficient quantities for HutchMed’s development or commercialization activities for licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory.

HutchMed has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out development activities in the HutchMed Territory as agreed by the parties and to seek to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of the licensed products in the HutchMed Territory. HutchMed agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory. HutchMed is responsible for all costs it incurs in developing, obtaining regulatory approval of, and commercializing licensed products in the HutchMed Territory, including costs incurred by HutchMed in conducting clinical trials that only include clinical sites in the HutchMed Territory. For global studies that we conduct and in which HutchMed elects to participate by conducting any such study in the HutchMed Territory, HutchMed will be responsible for enrolling and treating in the HutchMed Territory 20% of the total number of study patients of such global study and will be responsible for costs for those patients enrolled and treated in such trials. HutchMed will also be responsible for 20% of the costs of such global studies that are not specific to any territory and we will be responsible for all other costs of such global studies. HutchMed has agreed to participate in our EZH-301 and EZH-302 global studies, however under certain circumstances where the EZH-302 global study is not considered a confirmatory trial for regulatory approval in China, we shall be responsible for the costs of the trial in the HutchMed Territory.
 
Pursuant to the HutchMed License Agreement, we received a nonrefundable upfront payment of $25.0 million in September 2021. We are also entitled to milestone payments of up to $110.0 million in the aggregate for achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones with respect to licensed products in the HutchMed Territory, and up to $175.0 million in the aggregate for achievement of specified sales milestones in the HutchMed Territory with respect to the licensed products. We will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties, ranging from a mid-teens percentage to a low twenties percentage based on HutchMed’s cumulative annual net sales, if any, of licensed products in the HutchMed Territory. Royalties are payable for each licensed product commencing on the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product and ending, on a Jurisdiction-by-Jurisdiction basis, on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage, expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity or a specified period following the first commercial sale in such Jurisdiction and may be reduced in various circumstances.
 Under the HutchMed License Agreement, we issued a warrant to HutchMed, or the “HutchMed Warrant, exercisable at any time prior to August 7, 2025 for up to 5,653,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. On September 21, 2021 we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 registering for resale the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the HutchMed Warrant in accordance with the HutchMed Warrant. Such registration statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC on September 29, 2021.
 Term and Termination. Unless earlier terminated, the HutchMed License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last licensed product for the treatment of ES, FL, DLBCL and any additional indications agreed by the parties in the HutchMed Territory. HutchMed may terminate the HutchMed License Agreement in its entirety for any or no reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice to us. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the HutchMed License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, and under specified circumstances relating to the other party’s insolvency or if the other party or its

affiliates challenges the validity, patentability, or enforceability of patent rights that are owned by or licensed to such party or its affiliates and that are subject to the licenses granted in the HutchMed License Agreement.
 LYSA
In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization, or LYSARC, to conduct a combination trial of tazemetostat. LYSARC is the operational arm of LYSA, a premier cooperative group in France dedicated to clinical and translational research for lymphoma. Based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in a combination Phase 1b/2 trial with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, we agreed in 2020 to expand the trial to also include an expansion cohort for the front-line treatment of high-risk patients with FL. LYSA is conducting the Phase 2 clinical expansion trial and the Phase 1b part of the trial has completed. LYSA is managing the study operations for the trial, and we are recognizing our share of the related expenses as those costs are incurred over the duration of the trial. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022.
 GSK
On December 16, 2021, we received written notice from Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK, that GSK had elected to terminate the collaboration and license agreement entered into in January 2011, as amended. GSK terminated the agreement without cause, and in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the notice of termination, the termination will be effective on March 16, 2022, or the GSK Agreement Termination Effective Date. The agreement provided that the parties would discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule histone methyltransferase, or HMT, inhibitors directed to available targets from our product platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted GSK exclusive, worldwide license rights to HMT inhibitors directed to three targets. As part of the collaboration, we agreed to provide research and development services related to the licensed targets pursuant to agreed-upon research plans during a research term that ended January 8, 2015. We completed substantially all research obligations under the agreement by the end of the first quarter of 2015 and completed the transfer of the remaining data and material for these programs to GSK in the second quarter of 2015. GSK was then responsible for all future development and commercialization. Subsequent to a GSK strategic portfolio prioritization, we received notice in October 2017 that GSK terminated the agreement with respect to the third target, effective December 31, 2017, which returned all rights to that target to us. The two other targets, PRMT5 and PRMT1, continued to be subject to the agreement and were not impacted by the termination with respect to the third target. As a result of the termination of the agreement, as of the GSK Agreement Termination Effective Date, the license rights granted by us to GSK will terminate, GSK will cease to accrue any financial obligations to us and we will be entitled to pursue the PRMT5 and PRMT1 targets in all fields worldwide without further obligation to GSK.
 Companion Diagnostics
Roche Sequencing Solutions
In December 2012, Eisai and we entered into a companion diagnostics agreement with Roche Molecular under which Eisai and we engaged Roche Molecular to develop a companion diagnostic to identify patients who possess certain activating mutations of EZH2. In October 2013, this agreement was amended to include additional mutations in EZH2. The development costs due under the amended agreement with Roche Molecular were the responsibility of Eisai until the execution of the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai in March 2015, at which time we assumed responsibility for the remaining development costs due under the agreement. In December 2015, we and Eisai entered into a second amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement with Roche Molecular. The agreement was further amended in March 2018. Under the amended agreement, we were responsible for remaining development costs of $10.4 million due under the agreement as of March 2018 and Eisai agreed to reimburse us $0.9 million of this amount related to a regulatory milestone for Japan, which Eisai paid to us in the fourth quarter of 2020. In July 2019, we entered into a fourth amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement. Under the amended agreement, we and Roche Molecular agreed to divide a $1.0 million regulatory milestone for the United States into two separate milestone payments, of which $0.5 million was paid by us as part of the signed

amendment, and the remaining $0.5 million was paid by us in December 2019 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the fourth amendment to the companion diagnostics agreement. As part of this fourth amendment, Roche Molecular also assigned all of its rights and obligations under the companion diagnostics agreement to Roche Sequencing Solutions, or RSS, effective as of January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we are responsible for the remaining development costs of $1.0 million due under the agreement. In addition, we paid $1.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Under the agreement with RSS, RSS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to make commercially available the companion diagnostic kit. RSS has exclusive rights to commercialize the companion diagnostic kit developed pursuant to this agreement. On June 18, 2020 the FDA approved the companion diagnostic kit that is intended to identify FL patients with an EZH2 mutation for treatment with tazemetostat.
 The agreement with RSS will expire when we and Eisai are no longer developing or commercializing tazemetostat. We and Eisai may terminate the agreement by giving RSS 90 days’ written notice if we and Eisai discontinue development and commercialization of tazemetostat or determine, in conjunction with RSS, that the companion diagnostic is not needed for use with tazemetostat. Any party may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by any other party, in the event of material changes in circumstances that are contrary to key assumptions specified in the agreement or in the event of specified bankruptcy or similar circumstances. Under specified termination circumstances, RSS may become entitled to specified termination fees.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary compounds and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies, diagnostics and other inventions. Our patent portfolio is currently composed of over 300 issued patents and allowed patent applications and over 550 pending patent applications in the major pharmaceutical markets, that we own as well as license from other parties. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of HMTs, as well as to develop a proprietary position for new target classes, such as HATs and helicases.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional CMP and HMT inhibitor compounds and their derivatives, and to other new target classes. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies.
The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
EZH2. Our EZH2 patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent No. 8,410,088 covering the composition of matter of tazemetostat. This patent issued on April 2, 2013 and is expected to expire in 2032, not including extensions. Our EZH2 portfolio also includes 54 additional U.S. patents and more than 250 foreign patents, expected to expire between 2031 and 2037, not including extensions. The claims of these patents cover the composition of matter of EZH2 inhibitor compounds and various methods of their making and use. Patent applications in the same families as these patents are pending in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. The EZH2 program portfolio encompasses more than 40 patent families with pending patent applications relating to compositions of matter and methods of making and use of EZH2 inhibitors. The patent families in this portfolio are in various stages of prosecution and include patent applications filed in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States; Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions,

including the United States, and at least one U.S. provisional application that may be used as the basis for non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. Our patent applications in the EZH2 portfolio, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2031 and 2041, not including extensions.
SETD2. Our SETD2 patent portfolio includes six patent families directed to various product candidates and methods of use, with applications filed in the United States and internationally. Patents, if issued from currently pending applications in the SETD2 portfolio, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2042, not including extensions.
 EHMT2. Our EHMT2 patent portfolio includes more than eight patent families directed to various product candidates and methods of use, with applications filed in the United States and internationally. Patents, if issued from currently pending applications in the EHMT2 portfolio, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2038, not including extensions.
 Other Targets. We also have patent portfolios directed to targets other than EZH2, SETD2 and EHMT2, including the HMT targets DOT1L, PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1 (also known as PRMT4), PRMT5, PRMT6, PRMT8, SMYD2 and SMYD3. These patent portfolios have more than 35 patent families directed to various product candidates with applications filed in the United States, PCT applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, and U.S. provisional applications that may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. Patents, if issued in these portfolios are expected to expire between 2033 and 2041. We have more than 20 granted U.S. patents that cover PRMT5 inhibitors and their methods of use. These patents are expected to expire in 2033, not including extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have applied for patent term extension on a patent that covers the TAZVERIK drug substance (tazemetostat) based on the regulatory review of TAZVERIK for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. In the future, if and when any additional pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.

Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities and currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our development-stage product candidates including EZM0414 as well as our commercial product, tazemetostat. We have entered into clinical and commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturers for the clinical development and commercialization of tazemetostat.
Tazemetostat and EZM0414 are small molecules and are manufactured in third-party facilities that are equipped, staffed, and experienced in the manufacture of such pharmaceutical products. All such facilities have successful track-records manufacturing products for the United States, European Union, and rest of world markets, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements as appropriate.
We expect that any product candidates that we may develop will be small molecules that may be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
We rely on third parties for the manufacture of any diagnostics we may need or if required and may continue to enter into similar agreements for the manufacture of other diagnostics. We are currently collaborating with RSS for a diagnostic for its use with tazemetostat. As described above, under the agreement with RSS, RSS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to make commercially available the companion diagnostic kit. In June 2020 the FDA approved the companion diagnostic kit that is intended to identify follicular lymphoma patients with an EZH2 mutation for treatment with tazemetostat.
Commercialization
TAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities. This includes an efficiently sized field-based organization focused on Academic Centers of Excellence, Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and targeted community clinics. This includes an efficiently sized field-based organization of approximately 45 individuals.
 We are pursuing three strategic commercialization imperatives that we believe are integral to success for TAZVERIK in the United States:
 •ensure eligible ES and FL patients have access to TAZVERIK by educating healthcare providers, patients and payers on the TAZVERIK data in approved indications,
 •ensure that TAZVERIK is readily accessible by physicians as an essential treatment option for each labeled indication through incorporation into systems of care, consistent with the label and guidelines, and 
 •ensure our company sponsored programs for patients and healthcare providers (EpizymeNOW and EZH2NowSM) support a positive experience when TAZVERIK is prescribed. EpizymeNOW facilitates patient access to new TAZVERIK prescriptions, and the EZH2Now program provides access to EZH2 testing free of charge to patients with FL for providers who wish to know the mutation status of their patients.
Subject to receiving marketing approvals for additional indications or products, we expect to use our existing sales organization in the United States or to seek to expand our sales organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the hematologists and oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which tazemetostat is currently approved and for which it is being developed and for which any future product candidates may be developed. Outside the United States, we may choose to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval, or may choose to commercialize our products in certain markets,

depending upon many factors, including the target market size, availability of reimbursement, and our financial resources at the time.
We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan and greater China. Eisai holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan. On August 7, 2021, pursuant to a license agreement with HutchMed, we granted a license to HutchMed for the co-exclusive (with us) development and exclusive commercialization of tazemetostat, either as monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by us and HutchMed for the treatment of ES, FL and DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed to by us and HutchMed in the HutchMed Territory. For other geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to reaching patients, including through leveraging existing and identifying new strategic collaborations that can contribute to our ability to rapidly develop and commercialize tazemetostat outside of the United States.
 We expect that our collaborators for any companion or complementary diagnostics we may develop in the future for use with our therapeutic products will hold the commercial rights to these diagnostic products, as is the case for our collaboration with RSS. We expect to coordinate closely with any diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of any related therapeutic products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Companies that are developing new epigenetic treatments for cancer that target histone methyltransferases, or HMTs, and protein arginine methyltransferases, or PRMTs, include GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and MorphoSys AG. Further, companies which are known to have EZH2 inhibitor programs or related programs include: Constellation Pharmaceuticals, developing an EZH2 inhibitor CPI-0209, Phase 1/2, solid tumors and lymphoma, including DLBCL, Novartis AG, developing an EED inhibitor which indirectly blocks EZH2 (MAK683, Phase 1/2, advanced malignancies), Daiichi Sankyo, developing a EZH1/EZH2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat, DS-3201, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas, AML, ALL as well as Phase 2 for small cell lung cancer), and Pfizer, developing EZH2 inhibitor PF-06821497, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory SCLC, castration-resistant prostate cancer, FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapeutics that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs, and some including Celgene (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), Merck & Co., Inc., Secura Bio, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Foghorn Therapeutics, Forma Therapeutics and CellCentric are now marketing cancer treatments that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of

related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Tazemetostat. The most common treatments for FL are chemotherapies, usually combined with the monoclonal antibody Rituxan, or Gazyva, which is an antibody that acts against the same target as Rituxan, CD20. While Rituxan and a number of other widely used anti-cancer agents are labeled broadly for follicular lymphoma, no therapies are approved specifically for the treatment of tumors associated with EZH2 activating mutations. There are a number of companies currently evaluating investigational agents in the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting.
 In the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting, both current and near-term competition exists. Current competition includes CD20 combinations, several PI3K inhibitors, and CAR-T therapies. However, recently, two companies have announced that there have been voluntary withdrawals of accelerated approvals for FL indications for two PI3K inhibitors, Zydelig (idelalisib), and Copiktra (duvelisib) in the U.S. market. Additionally, parsaclisib’s NDA has been voluntarily withdrawn for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory FL. Near-term competition includes companies currently evaluating investigational agents with varying mechanisms of action, with a CAR-T therapy (KYMRIAH) and a PI3K inhibitor/CD20 combination (Aliqopa (copanlisib) + rituximab) currently undergoing review with the FDA. In the first quarter of 2021, Kite Pharma, a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, received FDA approval for its CAR-T therapy, YESCARTA, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FL patients. Novartis is also developing its CAR-T therapy, KYMRIAH, for relapsed or refractory FL patients. In the third quarter of 2021 the FDA accepted Novartis’ Supplemental Biologics License Application for KYMRIAH in adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL after two prior lines of treatment. The EMA also accepted Novartis’ Type II Variation for KYMRIAH in adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL after two prior lines of treatment in the third quarter of 2021. KYMRIAH is also undergoing priority review by the FDA for relapsed or refractory FL patients. The bispecific antibody furthest along in development in relapsed or refractory FL is Roche’s CD3/CD20 bispecific mosunetuzumab.
 Other than TAZVERIK, there are no therapies which have been approved specifically for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma. Epithelioid sarcoma, an INI1-negative tumor, is typically treated with surgical resection when it presents as localized disease. When epithelioid sarcoma recurs or metastasizes, it may be treated with systemic chemotherapy or investigational agents because, other than TAZVERIK, there are no approved systemic therapies specifically indicated for this disease. To the best of our knowledge there are no competitive products in development specifically for epithelioid sarcoma. However, we are aware of several clinical trials run by competitors that recruit patients with soft tissue sarcoma, which is inclusive of epithelioid sarcoma.
 EZM0414. Our current intention for EZM0414, through our SET-101 clinical trial, is to focus on patients with t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma once we reach the Phase 1b expansion portion of the trial. However, based on dose optimization data from the multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial, we may initiate a third patient cohort in DLBCL in the Phase 1b.


The most common treatments of multiple myeloma include ImiD (include Revlimid (lenalidomide), Pomalyst (pomalidomide), and Thalidomide (thalomid)), proteasome inhibitors (including Velcade (bortezomib), Kyprolis (xarfilzomib), and Ninlaro (ixazomib)), and anti-CD38 mAb (including Darzalex (daratumumab) and Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc)) combinations. Current therapies for the relapsed or refractory population also include BCMA targeting CAR-Ts and ADCs. The multiple myeloma pipeline is robust, and includes BCMA CAR-T therapies, bispecific antibodies, BiTEs, and CELMoDs. Additionally, there are assets in development for high risk MM and the t(4;14) subpopulation, including K36’s MMSET inhibitor KTX-1001.
 For DLBCL, the most common treatments are chemotherapies, often in combination with the monoclonal antibody Rituxan (rituximab) as well as autologous stem cell transplants. In the relapsed or refractory patient setting, current therapies include CAR-T therapies (Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel)), a CD19 mAb (Monjuvi (tafasitamab)), and ADCs (Policy (polatuzumab vedotin) and Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine)). DLBCL pipeline therapies include bispecific antibodies, ADCs, and CAR-T therapies.
While there are many assets in development for both multiple myeloma and DLBCL including those with novel mechanisms of action, other than EZM0414, there are no therapies in development that are SETD2 inhibitors.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, pricing, reimbursement, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. It is the responsibility of the company seeking to market a drug to test it and submit evidence that the drug is safe and effective. Failure to comply with applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations; 
 •design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •manufacture of drug substance and drug product to support clinical trials in compliance with FDA’s cGMP regulations;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 


•submission to the FDA of an NDA or sNDA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and/or clinical CROs to determine GCP compliance and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the application;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the NDA sponsor to assess compliance with GxPs;
 •payment of user fees per published Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines for that year, if applicable; 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or sNDA; and 
 •commitment to comply with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirements, to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 Preclinical Studies and an IND. Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and effectiveness. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable.
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after submission and receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA either provides a “safe to proceed” letter or raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or partial hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial to commence. Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated, if appropriate. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, often known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the candidate drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the investigational drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the

candidate drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In Phase 4, post-approval studies may be conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and a company’s designation of a clinical trial as a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy FDA requirements.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
In general, the FDA accepts foreign safety and efficacy studies that were not conducted under an IND provided that they are well designed, well conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conducted in accordance with ethical principles acceptable to the international community. The conduct of these studies must meet at least minimum standards for assuring human subject protection. Therefore, for studies submitted in support of an NDA that were conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, the agency requires demonstration that such studies were conducted in accordance with GCP, including receiving approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects.
In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how sponsors can utilize an adaptive trial design in the early stages of oncology product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by the FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to product development and reduce developmental costs and time.
Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use.
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies who do not otherwise qualify for an ongoing clinical trial. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment

will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access, but sponsors are required to make their expanded access policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition to and separate from expanded access, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Pediatric Studies. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Congress amended the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an NDA application or supplement to an NDA application. FL qualifies for an automatic full pediatric waiver by the FDA because it rarely or never occurs in pediatric patients.
The FDA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs.
 Submission and Filing of an NDA. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $3,117,218 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2022 is $369,413. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan drug designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
Under PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review and disposition of an application. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within

the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In the event that the FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review.” The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.
 In connection with its review of an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, may inspect the clinical CRO(s) to assure compliance with GCPs, and the FDA may also perform a sponsor inspection.
 The FDA has the option to refer questions regarding their review of a marketing application for a New Molecular Entity, or NME, to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA uses approximately 50 advisory committees and panels to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical, and policy matters. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Decisions on an NDA
 The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, the FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. Ultimately, the FDA will determine whether the expected benefits of the drug product outweigh its potential risks to patients.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue a complete response letter or an approval letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS

which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug (including a biologic) intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or biologics license application, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives. For example, a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than for the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Furthermore, federal law establishes certain tax credits designed to encourage the development of orphan drugs. With passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, that tax credit was halved from 50% to 25%. The granting of an orphan drug designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs. The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. None of these expedited programs changes the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” The FDA may grant breakthrough therapy designation to a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval.
Fast Track Designation. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA regarding drug development and may submit sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA on a rolling basis before the entire application is complete.
Priority Review. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review

an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
Accelerated Approval. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of well-conducted clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to perform post-marketing confirmatory study(ies) to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Although a drug may be designated as “breakthrough” or “fast track”, the determination of accelerated approval is based on the clinical endpoint and not on the expeditious manner in which it is being developed.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics. Safe and effective use of a drug may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to the treatment. FDA officials have issued guidance that addresses issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics, such as when the FDA will require that the diagnostic and the drug be approved simultaneously. The guidance issued in August 2014 states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance which describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. The FDA generally requires that devices, or in vitro companion diagnostics, intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, the FDA will typically require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for these cancer therapies.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $374,858 and the small business fee is $93,714.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 Post-Approval Commitments and Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual

user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug product.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security

of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In addition, federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other health care providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures.
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and Reimbursement. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish corresponding reimbursement levels. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of

prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, PPACA, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential product candidates are:
 •an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 
 •addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 •the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments 


for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
•established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. Further, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.
 Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”
 Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or

regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID‑19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.
 In addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.
 
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The order directs HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other

healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Patent Term Restoration and Extension. A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. The FDA’s regulations governing patient listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021.
Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
A 505(b)(2) application applies to a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” As with an ANDA, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
•the required patent information has not been filed; 
 •the listed patent has expired; 
 •the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
 •the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product. 
 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not

infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate patent infringement litigation in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. This interpretation was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, a drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Orphan drug exclusivity will also not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.

In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be implemented by the FDA.
 Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity periods described above, and any listed patent. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
 European Union Drug Approval Process
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Clinical Trial Approval in the EU. On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public.
 The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. As in the United States, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries.
 Marketing Authorization. To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, and optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum

timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. For the EMA, an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, which could include a request for waiver or deferral, is required prior to submitting an MAA for use for drugs in pediatric populations.
Priority Medicines, or PRIME, Drug Designation. The EMA may grant PRIME drug designation to medicine developers to treat an unmet medical need upon selection. Medicines eligible for PRIME must address an unmet medical need, have data available showing the potential to address this need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. PRIME designation provides early and enhanced support from the EMA to optimize the development of eligible medicines, speeds up their evaluation, and contributes to timely patients’ access. Once a candidate is selected for PRIME designation, the EMA will provide scientific advice at key development milestones and confirm potential for accelerated assessment at the time of an application for marketing authorization. These medicines are considered priority medicines by the EMA.
 Data and Market Exclusivity. In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from assessing a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete human clinical trial database and obtain marketing approval of its product.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing authorization and 10 years of market exclusivity of the designated indication following drug approval. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after authorization for small and medium enterprises. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Approval of Companion Diagnostic Devices. In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR which came into force on May 26, 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark of Conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold. To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices.
 Separately, the regulatory authorities in the EU also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, or IVDR, (EU) 2017/746, which will become effective in May 2022. The new regulation will replace the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device have until May 2022 to update their Technical Documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent Regulation. Once applicable, the regulation will, among other things: strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market; improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
 Reimbursement and Pricing of Prescription Pharmaceuticals. In the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments to those in the United States may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the U.S. and the EU, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, pharmaceutical firms may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of the product to other available therapies.
General Data Protection Regulation. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors.
The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020. The EU and the U.K. reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Brexit Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Brexit Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the EU and the U.K. will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Brexit Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the U.K. is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Brexit Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 1, 2022, we had approximately 250 full-time and part-time employees. After taking into account the cross-functional headcount reduction announced on March 1, 2022, we expect that we will have approximately 215 full-time and part-time employees, approximately 95 of whom will be primarily engaged in research and development activities. To provide us with flexibility in meeting varying workflow demands, we also engage temporary workers and consultants when needed.
