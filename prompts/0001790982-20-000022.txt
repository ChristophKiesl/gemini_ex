Item 1. Business.
General
Arconic Rolled Products Corporation is a Delaware corporation with its principal office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In conjunction with the separation described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the registrant plans to change its name to “Arconic Corporation”. 
The Company’s Internet address is http://www.arconic.com.  The information on the Company’s Internet site is not a part of, or incorporated by reference in, this annual report on Form 10-K. 
The Separation
In February 2019, Arconic Inc. (to be renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc.) (“ParentCo” or "Howmet Aerospace") announced its plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The separation will occur through a pro rata distribution to the ParentCo stockholders of 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Arconic Corporation (the “distribution”), which was formed to hold the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations of ParentCo, as well as the Latin America extrusions operations sold in April 2018 (the “Arconic Corporation Businesses”). On February 5, 2020, ParentCo's Board of Directors approved the completion of the separation, which is scheduled to become effective on April 1, 2020 (the “Separation Date”) at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.
3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In connection with the separation, Arconic Corporation incurred approximately $1.2 billion of indebtedness (see -Indebtedness below) and we expect that:

• | ParentCo will complete the internal reorganization as a result of which Arconic Rolled Products Corporation will become the holding company for the ParentCo operations comprising, and the entities that will conduct, the Arconic Corporation Businesses;

​

• | ParentCo will change its name to “Howmet Aerospace Inc.”;

​

• | “Arconic Rolled Products Corporation” will change its name to “Arconic Corporation”; and


• | using a portion of the net proceeds from one or more financing transactions on or prior to the completion of the distribution, Arconic Corporation will make a cash distribution to ParentCo. The payment to ParentCo will be calculated as the difference between (i) the approximately $1,165 of net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness and (ii) the difference between a beginning cash balance at the Separation Date of $500 and the amount of cash held by Arconic Corporation Businesses at March 31, 2020 ($72 as of December 31, 2019).

“When-issued” trading of Arconic Corporation common stock began on March 18, 2020 under the ticker symbol “ARNC WI” and will continue until the distribution date. “Regular-way” trading of Arconic Corporation common stock is expected to begin with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on April 1, 2020 under the ticker symbol “ARNC.”
At 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 1, 2020, the distribution date, each ParentCo stockholder will receive one share of Arconic Corporation common stock for every four shares of ParentCo common stock held at the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distribution. ParentCo stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Arconic Corporation common stock that they would have received after application of this ratio. Upon completion of the separation, each Arconic stockholder as of the record date will continue to own shares of ParentCo (which, as a result of ParentCo’s name change to Howmet Aerospace Inc., will be Howmet Aerospace shares) and will receive a proportionate share of the outstanding common stock of Arconic Corporation to be distributed. The distribution of Arconic Corporation common stock is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as described in Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Formation of Arconic Corporation
Arconic Rolled Products Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on August 14, 2019 for the purpose of holding the Arconic Corporation Businesses, and will be renamed Arconic Corporation in connection with the separation. As part of the separation, and prior to the distribution, ParentCo and its subsidiaries expect to complete an internal reorganization in order to transfer to Arconic Corporation the Arconic Corporation Businesses that it will hold following the separation. Among other things and subject to limited exceptions, the internal reorganization is expected to result in Arconic Corporation owning, directly or indirectly, the operations comprising, and the entities that conduct, the Arconic Corporation Businesses. 
After the separation, Howmet Aerospace and Arconic Corporation will each be separate companies with separate management teams and separate boards of directors. In connection with the separation, we have entered into and will also enter into various other agreements to effect the separation and to provide a framework for our relationship with Howmet Aerospace after the separation, including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, intellectual property license agreements, an agreement relating to the Davenport plant, metal supply agreements and real estate and office leases. These agreements will provide for the allocation between Arconic Corporation and Howmet Aerospace of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including, among others, investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) of ParentCo and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation and will govern the relationship between Arconic Corporation and Howmet Aerospace subsequent to the completion of the separation. For additional information regarding the separation agreement and other transaction agreements, see Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Indebtedness
On February 7, 2020, we closed our offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% second-lien notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the offering to make a payment to ParentCo to fund the transfer of certain assets from ParentCo to us in connection with the separation and for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the offering will be held in escrow until the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, including the substantially concurrent completion of the separation. Prior to the separation, the 2028 Notes will not be guaranteed. Following the escrow

TABLE OF CONTENTS

release, the 2028 Notes will be guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Each of the 2028 Notes and the related guarantees will be secured on a second-priority basis by liens on certain assets of ours and the guarantors.
The 2028 Notes and related guarantees were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act (the “Securities Act”), and to certain non-United States persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2028 Notes and related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the benefit of, US persons absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Additionally, on March 25, 2020, Arconic Corporation entered into a credit agreement, which provides a $600 million Senior Secured First-Lien Term B Loan Facility (variable rate and seven-year term) (the “Term Loan”) and a $1.0 billion Senior Secured First-Lien Revolving Credit Facility (variable rate and five-year term) ("the Credit Facility”), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (“the Credit Agreement”). The gross availability of $1.0 billion under the Credit Facility is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants based on the trailing twelve months of financial performance. For illustrative purposes, assuming the separation had previously occurred and the capital structure had been in place on December 31, 2019, the pro forma 2019 last twelve months of earnings would have resulted in approximately $760 million of net availability under the Credit Facility. The illustrative availability is based upon a variety of assumptions and, though considered reasonable by the Company, may not be indicative of future availability. We intend to use the proceeds from the Term Loan to make a payment to ParentCo to fund the transfer of certain assets from ParentCo to us in connection with the separation, to pay fees, costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information about the 2028 Notes and the Credit Facility. 
The variable interest rate with respect to the Term Loan is currently based on LIBOR for the relevant interest period plus an applicable margin of 2.75% and the variable commitment fee for undrawn capacity related to the Credit Facility is 0.35%. The provisions of the Term Loan require a mandatory 1% repayment of the initial $600 million borrowing each annual period during the seven-year term. Following the Separation, the Term Loan and the Credit Facility will be guaranteed by certain of Arconic Corporation’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Each of the Term Loan, the Credit Facility, and the related guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by liens on certain assets of Arconic Corporation and the guarantors, as defined therein.
The following discussion of Arconic Corporation’s business assumes the completion of the separation and the related transactions described above.
Overview
Arconic Corporation is a global leader in manufacturing aluminum sheet, plate, extrusions and architectural products, serving primarily the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial, and packaging end-markets. We maintain a leadership position in our targeted markets through our global footprint of 46 manufacturing, sales and service facilities located across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia and Asia. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of $7.3 billion and operating income of $277 million.
Description of the Business
Our Portfolio
We manage our business operations through three segments: Rolled Products, Extrusions, and Building and Construction Systems ("BCS"). 
Rolled Products
Rolled products are used in the production of finished goods ranging from airframes and automotive body panels to industrial plate and brazing sheet. Sheet and plate are used extensively in the transportation industries as well as in building and construction. They are also used for industrial applications such as tooling plate for the production of plastic products.
Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products segment produces a range of aluminum sheet and plate products for the following markets:
Ground Transportation — provides specialty aluminum sheet and plate products, including auto body sheet, structural reinforcement, proprietary heat exchanger products like multilayer brazing sheet, trailer and cab structures and sheet for fuel tanks.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Aerospace — supplies a wide range of highly differentiated sheet and plate products that meet strict quality requirements for aerospace applications, including polished fuselage sheet, structural parts, aluminum-lithium stringers, and wing skins.
Industrial — supplies a diverse range of industrial solutions for applications that include mold and tooling plate for semiconductors; general engineering/machinery and injection molding applications; specialty finishes for appliances, cosmetic packaging, RVs and vehicle components; tread plate/sheet for toolbox and flooring applications; and circles for cookware.
Packaging — serves the packaging market in Europe and Asia through regional facilities located in Russia and China. The packaging market includes a full range of can stock products, from coated end and tab stock to body stock.
Rolled Products — Competitive Conditions
Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products segment is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled markets in which it participates, including ground transportation (including brazing sheet), aerospace, industrial and packaging markets. While Rolled Products participates in markets where Arconic Corporation believes it has a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy, advanced manufacturing capability, unique technology and/or differentiated products, in certain cases, our competitors are capable of making products similar to Arconic Corporation’s products. We continuously work to maintain and enhance our competitive position through innovation: new alloys such as high-formability automotive alloys, aluminum lithium aerospace alloys, differentiated products such as our 5-layer brazing products and break-through processes such as A951™ bonding technology.
Some of Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products markets are global and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these segments by competitors varies. For example, Novelis is the largest flat rolled products producer competing in automotive, but it does not participate in the aerospace market. On the other hand, Kaiser participates in aerospace, but does not participate in the automotive sheet market. Other competitors include Aleris, AMAG, Constellium, Hydro, Kobe, Nanshan, and UACJ.
Additionally, there are a number of new competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. Arconic Corporation expects that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs.

Extrusions
Arconic Corporation’s Extrusions segment produces a range of extruded products, including aerospace shapes (wing stringer, floor beams, fuselage, cargo), automotive shapes (driveshafts, anti-lock brake housings, turbo charger), seamless tube, hollows, mortar fins and high strength rod and bar. With process and product technologies that include large and small extrusion presses, integrated cast houses, horizontal heat treat furnaces, vertical heat treat furnaces, annealing furnaces, induction billet heating and ultrasonic inspection capabilities, Arconic Corporation’s Extrusions operating segment serves a broad range of customers in several of our core market segments, including the following:
Ground Transportation — provides aluminum extrusions for applications that include drive shafts for the automotive market and aluminum frame rails for the commercial transportation market.
Aerospace — supplies a wide range of applications for commercial airframes.
Industrial — supplies a diverse range of industrial solutions for applications that include rods and bars for building supplies and other industrial applications.
Arconic Corporation’s Extrusions plants are strategically located in close proximity to key customers, which offers a competitive advantage for markets that require products within short lead times. It also fosters close collaboration with customers who work with us to develop solutions that drive performance, safety and efficiency in their end products.
Extrusions — Competitive Conditions
The Extrusions segment is a leader in many of the markets in which it participates, including aerospace, automotive (including driveshafts) and industrial markets. While Extrusions participates in markets where Arconic Corporation believes we have a significant competitive position due to customer intimacy, advanced manufacturing capability, unique technology and/or differentiated products, in certain cases, our competitors are capable of making products similar to Arconic Corporation’s products. We continuously work to maintain and enhance our competitive position through innovation: new alloys such as aluminum lithium aerospace alloys and differentiated products.
Some of Arconic Corporation’s Extrusions markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused. Participation in these segments by competitors varies. For example, UAC is the largest competitor in aerospace extrusions, but it does not participate in the drawn tubing market. On the other hand, Unna participates in drawn tubing, but they do not compete in extrusions. Other competitors include Kaiser, Constellium, Otto Fuchs, Taber, Ye Fong, and Impol.
Additionally, there are a number of other competitors emerging, particularly in China and other developing economies. We expect that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs.

Building and Construction Systems
Our BCS business manufactures differentiated products and building envelope solutions, including entrances, curtain walls, windows, composite panel and coil coated sheet. The business operates in two market segments: architectural systems, which carry the Kawneer® brand, and architectural products, which carry the Reynobond® and Reynolux® brands. The BCS business has competitive positions in both market segments, attributable to its strong brand recognition, high quality products and strong relationships through the building and construction value chain.
 As the inventor of the modern storefront more than 100 years ago, our Kawneer® branded architectural systems products include windows, doors and curtain walling. Kawneer is a premium brand, known for the breadth, depth and performance of its product portfolio and is a leading manufacturer of architectural systems in North America, with an established presence in Europe. Key customers of this market segment include fabricators and glazing subcontractors.
The Reynobond and Reynolux brands deliver innovative exterior and interior cladding and coil coated sheet solutions with end uses that include building façades, retail, sign and display, interior applications and various industrial applications. Reynobond is composite material that consists of an extruded core that is fused between two sheets of coil-coated aluminum and Reynolux is coil-coated aluminum sheet that can be sold in coil or flat-sheet form. Key customers include metal fabricators and installers.
BCS differentiates itself through its global footprint and by offering a broad portfolio of building envelope products that span the range of building end-use and building complexities. Architects, general contractors and fabricators consider BCS a go-to provider of products that are offered as systems and are localized to address functional and building code requirements. We believe that our products and systems have a reputation for quality and reliability. 
Building and Construction Systems — Competitive Conditions
In North America, Arconic Corporation’s BCS segment primarily competes in the nonresidential building segment. In Europe, it competes in both the residential and the nonresidential building segments. Arconic Corporation’s competitive advantage is based on strong brands, innovative products, customer intimacy and technical services.
In the architectural systems market, Arconic Corporation competes with regional competitors like Apogee, YKK, and Oldcastle in North America and Schüco, Hydro/SAPA and Reynaers in Europe. The competitive landscape in the architectural systems market has been relatively stable since the mid-2000s, with the major competitors in North America and Europe remaining constant, despite some industry consolidation in North America during the late 2000s.
The primary product categories in architectural products are aluminum composite material and coil coated sheet. The architectural products business is a more global market and is primarily served by subsidiaries of larger companies like Alpolic (Mitsubishi Corporation), Alucobond (Schweiter Technologies) and Novelis (Aditya Birla Group).
List of Major Competitors for Architectural Systems:

Major Product and Customer Revenues
Products that contributed 10% or more to combined revenues were as follows:

​ | For the Years Ended December 31,
​ | 2019 | ​ | 2018 | | 2017
Rolled products | 77 | % | ​ | 75 | % | 75 | %
Architectural systems | 15 | % | ​ | 15 | % | 16 | %

Sales to Arconic Corporation’s largest customer, Ford, accounted for 13% of our total revenue for 2019. These sales were made under various contracts relating to Ford vehicle programs, such as the F-150, F-250/350, Explorer and Navigator vehicles. The loss of sales to Ford under all of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business if such sales are not replaced by sales to other customers. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2019.
Customer and Distribution Channel
Rolled Products and Extrusions
Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products group and Extrusions group have two primary sales channels for the segments in which we operate: direct sales to our customers and sales to distributors.
Direct Sales
Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products group and Extrusions group supply various segments all over the world through a direct sales force operating from individual facilities or sales offices. The direct sales channel typically serves very large, sophisticated customers and OEMs, but can also service medium and small size customers as well. Long-standing relationships are maintained with leading companies in industries using aluminum rolled and extruded products. Supply contracts for large global customers generally range from one to five years in length and historically, in segments such as aerospace, there has been a high degree of renewal business with these customers. As the manufacture of aluminum-intensive and higher content aluminum vehicles continues to grow, we continue to develop long-term relationships with the automotive OEMs. In some cases, the products Arconic Corporation supplies are proprietary in nature. Further, certain industries, such as automotive and aerospace, and their related customers require suppliers to complete a rigorous qualification process; the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications is 
9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

an important part of doing business in these segments. A customer’s cost to switch and either find a new product or qualify a new supplier can be significant, so it is in both the customer’s and the supplier’s best interest to maintain these relationships.
Distributors
Arconic Corporation’s Rolled Products group and Extrusions group also sell their products through third-party distributors. Customers of distributors are typically widely dispersed, and sales through this channel are usually highly fragmented. Distributors sell mostly commodity or less specialized products into many end-use segments in smaller quantities.
BCS
Arconic Corporation’s BCS business supplies architectural facade systems and products principally in North America and Europe but also globally through both direct sales and distributors. Its typical customers are installers or fabricators who purchase product on a project-by-project basis. Long-standing relationships are maintained with its leading customers. BCS also maintains an e-commerce platform for numerous standard architectural products for use by its North American customers and offers standard architectural products for purchase in its service centers.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Important raw materials used by Arconic Corporation are: primary aluminum for remelting (sows, t-bars, and ingots, including high purity and off-grade), aluminum alloyed and unalloyed casthouse products (including rolling slab and billet), aluminum scrap, alloying materials (including, but not limited to, magnesium, copper, and zinc), aluminum coil, electricity, natural gas, coatings, lube oil, packaging materials, and resin. Generally, other materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. We believe that the raw materials necessary to the Arconic Corporation businesses are and will continue to be available.
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
We believe that our domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Our rights under our patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to us as a whole, and to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by us generally concern metal alloys, particular products, manufacturing equipment or techniques. The Arconic Corporation business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, we continue to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2019, our worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 631 granted patents and 254 pending patent applications.
We also have a significant number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give us important advantages in our markets. We continue to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.
With respect to domestic and foreign trademarks, we have many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name “Arconic” and the Arconic symbol for aluminum products, Kawneer for building panels, and Reynobond and Reynolux for architectural products. As of December 31, 2019, our worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 616 registered trademarks and 457 pending trademark applications. Our rights under our trademarks are important to us as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.
Research and Development
We engage in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Throughout 2019, we continued working on new developments and leveraging new technologies. The Arconic Technology Center (ATC), located in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, serves as the headquarters for our research and development efforts, and we also have R&D facilities in Norcross, Georgia, Merxheim, France, Vendargues, France, and Harderwijk, Netherlands. These facilities focus on innovation and have given us a leading position in the development of proprietary next-generation specialty alloys and manufacturing processes as evidenced by our robust intellectual property portfolio. 
Environmental Matters
Approved capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control are $9.2 million for 2020 and estimated expenditures for such purposes are $12.6 million for 2021. Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note T to the Combined Financial Statements under the caption “Contingencies and Commitments — Contingencies - Environmental Matters.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Employees
Total worldwide employment at the end of 2019 was approximately 15,400 employees with plant operations in 10 countries. Many of these employees are represented by labor unions. We believe that relations with our employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.
In the United States, approximately 4,300 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest collective bargaining agreement is the master collective bargaining agreement between us and the United Steelworkers (“USW”). The USW master agreement covers approximately 3,300 employees at four U.S. locations. The current labor agreement expires on May 15, 2022. There are eight other collective bargaining agreements in the United States with varying expiration dates.
On a regional basis, there are agreements between Arconic Corporation and unions with varying expiration dates that cover employees in Europe, Russia, North America, South America, and Asia.
