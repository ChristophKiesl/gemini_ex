Item 1.   Business
Overview and Strategy
XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), a Delaware corporation, is a biotech royalty aggregator. We have a sizable portfolio of economic rights to future potential milestone and royalty payments associated with partnered pre-commercial therapeutic candidates. Our portfolio was built through licensing our proprietary products and platforms from our legacy discovery and development business, combined with acquisitions of rights to future milestones and royalties that we have 

3



made since our royalty aggregator business model was implemented in 2017. We expect that most of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. 
Our strategy is to expand our pipeline by acquiring additional potential milestone and royalty revenue streams on drug product candidates from third parties. Expanding our pipeline through these acquisitions can allow for further diversification across therapeutic areas and development stages. Our ideal target acquisitions are in pre-commercial stages of development, have an expected long duration of market exclusivity, high revenue potential, and are partnered with a large pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical enterprise. 
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose risks to our business as clinical trials industry-wide have slowed. Our business is dependent on the continued development and commercialization efforts of our licensees and our royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees. We have been monitoring and continue to monitor our portfolio programs for potential delays in underlying research programs and elections of our partners to continue or cease development. Delays in clinical trials and underlying research programs may lead to delayed revenue from milestones from our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties or, if certain research programs are discontinued, we may recognize impairment charges for our royalty receivables. COVID-19, the related variants, and the timing of vaccine distribution may impact our underlying programs in a variety of ways which are unknown in length and scope at this time.

Acquisitions
Royalty Purchase Agreement with Agenus, Inc.
In September 2018, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the “Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with Agenus, Inc. (“Agenus”). Under the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, we purchased from Agenus the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Incyte (net of certain royalties payable by Agenus to a third party) and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of six Incyte immuno-oncology assets. In addition, we purchased from Agenus the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Merck and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of MK-4830, an immuno-oncology product currently in clinical development. Pursuant to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, our share in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones is up to $59.5 million and the royalties have no limit. Under the terms of the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Agenus $15.0 million. We financed $7.5 million of the purchase price with a three-year term loan under our Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) dated May 7, 2018. 
In November 2020, MK-4830 advanced to Phase 2 development stage. As a result of the advancement, Agenus earned a $10.0 million clinical development milestone pursuant to its license agreement with Merck, of which we earned $1.0 million.

Royalty Purchase Agreement with Bioasis Technologies, Inc.
In February 2019, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with Bioasis Technologies, Inc. (the “Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement”) and certain affiliates (collectively “Bioasis”). Under the Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement, we purchased potential future milestone, royalty and option fee payment rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a License Agreement between Bioasis and Prothena Biosciences Limited. Under the terms of the Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Bioasis an upfront cash payment of $0.3 million and will be required to make contingent future cash payments of up to $0.2 million to Bioasis if and when the licensed product candidates reach certain development milestones. As of December 31, 2020, none of the development milestones had been achieved. In addition, we were granted an option to purchase a 1% royalty right on the next two license agreements entered into between Bioasis and third-party licensees subject to certain payments and conditions as well as a right of first negotiation on subsequent Bioasis license agreements with third parties.
In November 2020, we entered into a second royalty purchase agreement with Bioasis (the “Second Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement”). Under the Second Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement, we purchased potential future milestone and other payments, and royalty rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a research collaboration and license agreement between Bioasis and Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. (“Chiesi”). We paid Bioasis $1.2 million upon closing of the Second Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement for the purchased rights.
Royalty Purchase Agreement with Aronora, Inc.
In April 2019, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with Aronora, Inc. (the “Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement”), a private research and development company headquartered in Portland, Oregon. Under the Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement, we purchased from Aronora the rights to potential royalties and a portion of upfront, milestone, and option payments associated with five anti-thrombotic hematology drug products in development: three candidates subject to Aronora’s collaboration with Bayer Pharma AG (“Bayer”) (the “Bayer Products”) and two additional early-stage candidates (the “non-Bayer Products”).
Under the terms of the Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement, we made a $6.0 million upfront payment to Aronora when the transaction closed on June 26, 2019, and in September 2019 we made an additional $3.0 million payment for the three Bayer Products that were active as of September 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement, if we receive $250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product, we will be required to pay associated tiered milestones payments to Aronora in an aggregate amount of up to $85.0 million per product. The tiered milestones will be paid based on various royalty tiers prior to reaching $250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product. We will retain royalties per product in excess of $250.0 million. We will receive, on average, low single-digit royalties on future sales of the Bayer Products and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones related to the Bayer Products. In addition, we purchased from Aronora the right to receive low-single digit percentage of net sales of the non-Bayer Products and 10% of all future payments, including upfront payments, option payments and developmental, regulatory and sales milestone payments on potential future sales of the non-Bayer Products. We financed $4.5 million of the purchase price with a three-year term loan under our Loan and Security Agreement with SVB dated May 7, 2018. In July 2020, Bayer elected to not exercise its option on the third Bayer Product and that product is now subject to the same economics as the non-Bayer Products.
​
Royalty Purchase Agreement with Palobiofarma, S.L.
In September 2019, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the “Palo Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with Palobiofarma, S.L, (“Palo”). Pursuant to the Palo Royalty Purchase Agreement, we acquired the rights to potential royalty payments in low single digit percentages of aggregate net sales associated with six drug candidates in various clinical development stages, targeting the adenosine pathway with potential applications in solid tumors, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, psoriasis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other indications (the “Palo Licensed Products”) that are being developed by Palo. Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) is a development partner on NIR178, one of the Palo Licensed Products, and NIR178 is being developed pursuant to a license agreement between Palo and Novartis. Under the terms of the Palo Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Palo $10.0 million for the rights to potential royalty payments on future sales of the Palo Licensed Products. We financed $5.0 million of the purchase price with a three-year term loan under our Loan and Security Agreement with SVB dated May 7, 2018.

Selected Programs Underlying Our Core Pipeline
Historically, we have licensed product candidates or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, such as Novartis and Takeda, in pursuit of new antibody products under which we are eligible to receive potential future milestone payments and royalties. The following is a summary of material license and collaboration agreements that represent a significant component of our core pipeline.
Novartis – Anti-TGFβ Antibody
In September 2015, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (“Novartis International”) entered into a license agreement (the “Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement”) under which we granted Novartis International an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGFβ antibody program (“NIS793”). Novartis International is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program.
Under the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement, we received a $37.0 million upfront fee, and are eligible to receive up to a total of $480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-teens. This program is currently in clinical testing.
In October 2020, the first patient was dosed in Novartis International's NIS793 Phase 2 clinical trial and we earned a $25.0 million milestone payment. As specified under the terms the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement, we received $17.7 million in cash and the remaining balance of $7.3 million was recognized as a reduction to our debt obligation to Novartis. We recorded $25.0 million as revenue from contracts with customers in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Novartis – Anti-CD40 Antibody
In February of 2004, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, multi-product collaboration agreement with Chiron Corporation (“Chiron”) to research, develop and commercialize multiple antibody products for the treatment of cancer, and such agreement was replaced with a more detailed agreement entered in May of 2005 (the “Chiron Collaboration Agreement”). The Chiron Collaboration Agreement was a risk-sharing arrangement whereby Chiron and XOMA shared expenses and revenues on a 70-30 basis, with XOMA’s share being 30%. Financial terms included a loan facility from Chiron to XOMA, secured by XOMA’s 30% ownership interest in the collaboration, of up to $50.0 million to fund up to 75% of our share of expenses beginning in 2005. 
In October 2005, Chiron announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Novartis AG (“Novartis”) under which Novartis acquired all of the shares of Chiron that it did not already own. This transaction closed in 2006 at which time Novartis acquired Chiron’s interest in the Chiron Collaboration Agreement. In July of 2008, Novartis and XOMA restructured the Chiron Collaboration Agreement, which involved six development programs including iscalimab, a fully human anti-CD40 antagonist antibody intended as a treatment for B-cell mediated diseases, including malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As part of the restructuring, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (“NVDI”), the successor to Chiron, was granted, among other things, control over the ongoing product development collaborations remaining thereunder, including iscalimab. In September 2015, the parties agreed to reduce the royalty-style payments that XOMA is eligible to receive on sales of NVDI’s clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies (such as iscalimab). These royalty-style payments are tiered based on sales levels and now have percentage rates ranging from mid-single digit to low-teens.
​
Our right to royalty-style payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the first commercial sale of each product in each country. Novartis is currently conducting clinical testing of iscalimab in several indications.

Novartis – Gevokizumab 
In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into a license agreement (the “Gevokizumab License Agreement”), under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab (“VPM087”) (a clinical stage product candidate) and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the Gevokizumab License Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of VPM087 and products containing such antibody.
Under the Gevokizumab License Agreement, we received total consideration of $30.0 million in 2017 for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, $15.7 million was paid in cash and $14.3 million (equal to €12.0 million) was paid by Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. (“NIBR”), on our behalf, to settle our loan with Les Laboratories Servier (“Servier”). In addition, NIBR extended the maturity date on our debt to Novartis to September 30, 2022. We also received $5.0 million related to the sale of 539,131 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $9.2742. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $438.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single digit to mid-teens. This program is in early clinical testing.
Unless terminated earlier, the Gevokizumab License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis’ royalty obligations end. The Gevokizumab License Agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the Gevokizumab License Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety with six months’ prior written notice. 
Takeda
In November 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”) under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda.
Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we may receive additional milestone payments aggregating up to $19.0 million relating to TAK-079 (mezagitamab) and a 4% royalty on future sales of all products subject to this license, including TAK-169, which entered a phase 1 study in February 2020. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent (or 12 years from first commercial sale if there is significant generic competition post patent-expiration).

8



In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to $3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed.
In November 2020, the first patient was dosed in Takeda’s Phase 2 study of mezagitamab and we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment from Takeda.
Rezolute
In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Rezolute, Inc. (formerly AntriaBio, Inc.) (“Rezolute”) pursuant to which we granted an exclusive global license to Rezolute to develop and commercialize products containing X358 (now RZ358), a Phase 2 product candidate, for all indications. We and Rezolute also entered into a common stock purchase agreement.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is responsible for all development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities associated with RZ358 and is required to make certain clinical, regulatory and annual net sales milestone payments to us of up to $232.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria. Rezolute is also obligated to pay us royalties ranging from the high single digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of RZ358. Rezolute is obligated to take customary steps to advance RZ358, and to meet certain spending requirements on an annual basis for the program until a marketing approval application for RZ358 is accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular licensed product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. Rezolute’s future royalty obligations in the United States will be reduced by 20% if the manufacture, use or sale of a licensed product is not covered by a valid XOMA patent claim, until such a claim is issued.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is required to pay us a low single-digit royalty on sales of Rezolute’s other products from its existing programs, currently in preclinical and early clinical stages. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular Rezolute product and country will continue for the longer of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or for so long as Rezolute or its licensee is selling such product in such country, provided that such royalty will terminate upon the termination of the licensee’s obligation to make payments to Rezolute based on sales of such product in such country.
We also granted Rezolute an option through June 1, 2019 for an exclusive license for their choice of one of our preclinical insulin receptor monoclonal antibody fragments, including X129. On June 1, 2019, such option expired unexercised. The license agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Rezolute also has a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety on ninety-days’ notice at any time. 
Rezolute License Agreement - First Amendment
​
In March 2018, we and Rezolute amended the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement. Pursuant to the as-amended terms of the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute was required to pay us $6.0 million in cash, to issue us $8.5 million worth of its common stock, and to issue us 7,000,000 shares of its common stock, contingent on the completion of its financing activities. Further, in the event that Rezolute did not complete a financing that raised at least $20.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds (“Qualified Financing”) by March 31, 2019 (the “2019 Closing”), it would issue to us an additional number of shares of its common stock equal to $8.5 million divided by the weighted average of the closing bid and ask prices or the average closing prices of Rezolute’s common stock on the ten-day trading period prior to March 31, 2019. Finally, if Rezolute was unable to complete a Qualified Financing by 

9



March 31, 2020, it was obliged to pay us $15.0 million in order to maintain the license. Under the common stock purchase agreement, Rezolute granted us the right and option to sell the greater of (i) 5,000,000 shares of common stock or (ii) one third of the aggregate shares held by us upon failure by Rezolute to list its shares of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar national exchange on or prior to December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, Rezolute closed a debt financing activity for gross proceeds of $4.0 million, which triggered the Initial Closing, and completed an Interim Financing Closing, as defined in the common stock purchase agreement. These financing activities resulted in receipt of 8,093,010 shares of Rezolute’s common stock and cash of $0.5 million. Under the amended license agreement, we were also entitled to receive $0.3 million of reimbursable technology transfer expenses from Rezolute. 
Rezolute License Agreement - Second Amendment
In January 2019, we and Rezolute further amended the license agreement and common stock purchase agreement. The license agreement was amended to eliminate the requirement that equity securities be issued to us upon the closing of the Qualified Financing and to replace it with a requirement that Rezolute: (1) make five cash payments to us totaling $8.5 million following the closing of a Qualified Financing on or before specified staggered future dates through September 2020 (the “Future Cash Payments”); and (2) provide for early payment of the Future Cash Payments (only until the above referenced $8.5 million is reached) by making cash payments to us equal to 15% of the net proceeds of each future financing following the closing of the Qualified Financing, with such payments to be credited against any remaining unpaid Future Cash Payments in reverse order of their scheduled payment date. In accordance with the terms of the license agreement, we received an additional $5.5 million in cash upon the closing of the Qualified Financing in February 2019. In July and August 2019, Rezolute received additional cash through two common stock financing events, resulting in early payment of $3.4 million of unrecognized Future Cash Payments. In addition, we received the $1.5 million and $1.0 million payments due in September 2019 and December 2019, respectively, resulting in a total of $11.4 million in cash received from Rezolute for Qualified Financing and Future Cash Payments in the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding receivable of $2.6 million representing the current estimate of the Future Cash Payments expected to be received from Rezolute. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $14.0 million as revenue from Rezolute.
The license agreement amendment also revised the amount Rezolute is required to expend on development of RZ358 and related licensed products and revised provisions with respect to Rezolute’s diligence efforts in conducting clinical studies. Lastly, the common stock purchase agreement was amended to remove certain provisions related to the issuance of equity to us in accordance with the new provisions regarding the Future Cash Payments in the license agreement. Specifically, the common stock purchase agreement was amended to provide XOMA the right to sell up to 5,000,000 shares of Rezolute common stock currently held by us, back to Rezolute if it fails to list its shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar national exchange on or prior to December 31, 2019. Only 2,500,000 shares may be sold back to Rezolute during calendar year 2020. Any such shares may be sold back to Rezolute at the average of the closing bid and asked prices of its common stock quoted on its principal trading market on the date of such put option exercise. As of December 31, 2019, Rezolute failed to list its shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or a similar exchange. 
Rezolute License Agreement - Third Amendment
In March 2020, we and Rezolute further amended the license agreement to extend the payment schedule for the remaining $2.6 million in Future Cash Payments. The amendment to the payment terms was in response to Rezolute’s need to preserve cash as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extended payment schedule did not impact the total amount due, but instead, spread the $2.6 million into seven quarterly payments to be paid through September 30, 2021. The amended license agreement required that in the event Rezolute completed a Qualified Financing at any time between March 31, 2020 and the date of the final payment, Rezolute would pay all amounts outstanding within fifteen days following the closing of the Qualified Financing. 
In October 2020, Rezolute completed a private placement of its equity securities with gross proceeds of $41.0 million, which was considered a Qualified Financing event under the third amendment of the Rezolute license agreement 

10



(the “Third Amendment”). The Qualified Financing resulted in acceleration of the remaining receivables of $1.4 million due from Rezolute, and we received the entire amount in October 2020. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Rezolute completed a 1:50 reverse stock split of its common shares and started trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, our holding of Rezolute common stock was reduced from 8,093,010 shares to 161,860 shares.
Proprietary Product Candidates
We have a pipeline of unique monoclonal antibodies and technologies available to license to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further their clinical development. A summary of these product candidates is provided below:

● | PTH1R program. We have generated an anti-parathyroid receptor pipeline that includes several functional antibody antagonists targeting PTH1R, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism. These antibodies have shown promising efficacy in in vivo studies and could potentially address unmet medical needs, including primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (“HHM”). HHM is present in many advanced cancers and is caused by high serum calcium due to increased levels of the PTH1R ligand PTH-related peptide (“PTHrP”). Current HHM treatments often fall short and many cancer patients die from ‘metabolic death’. Our PTH1R antibodies could be beneficial for the treatment of HHM.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | XMetA is an insulin receptor-activating antibody designed to provide long-acting reduction of hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients, potentially reducing the advancement to a number of insulin injections needed to control their blood glucose levels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | X213 (formerly LFA 102) is an allosteric inhibitor of prolactin action. It is a humanized IgG1-Kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor with high affinity at an allosteric site. The antibody has been shown to inhibit prolactin-mediated signaling, and it is potent and similarly active against several animal and human prolactin receptors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technologies Available for Non-Exclusive License
We have a set of antibody discovery, optimization and development technologies available for licensing, including:

● | ADAPT™ (Antibody Discovery Advanced Platform Technologies): proprietary human antibody phage display libraries, integrated with yeast and mammalian display, which can be integrated into antibody discovery programs through license agreements. We believe access to ADAPT™ Integrated Display offers a number of benefits because it enables the diversity of phage libraries to be combined with accelerated discovery due to rapid immunoglobulin (“IgG”) reformatting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting based screening using yeast and mammalian display. This increases the probability of success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ModulX™: technology which allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways, homeostatic control, and disease biology. Using ModulX™, we have generated product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents (e.g. receptor-ligand). ModulX™ technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease.

suitable for medical purposes in humans. The technology uses a unique method developed by us, based on analysis of the conserved structure-function relationships among antibodies. The method defines which residues in a non-human variable region are candidates to be modified. The result is an HE™ antibody with preserved antigen binding, structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity. HE™ technology was used in development of gevokizumab (VPM087) and certain other antibody products.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Targeted Affinity Enhancement™ (“TAE™”): a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity. TAE™ generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the complementarity-determining region likely to impact binding. The technology has been licensed to a number of companies.

Debt Agreements
Novartis
In connection with the collaboration between XOMA and Novartis AG (then Chiron Corporation), a secured note agreement was executed in May 2005. The note agreement is secured by our interest in the collaboration and was due and payable in full on June 21, 2015. In June 2015, we and NVDI, who assumed the note agreement, agreed to extend the maturity date of our secured note agreement from June 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015, which was then subsequently extended to September 30, 2020. In September 2017, in connection with the Gevokizumab License Agreement with Novartis, we and NIBR, who assumed the note agreement from NVDI, executed an amendment to the note agreement under which we further extended the maturity date of the note to September 30, 2022. 
In October 2020, the first patient was dosed in Novartis International’s NIS793 Phase 2 clinical trial NCT04390763 and we earned a $25.0 million milestone payment, of which $7.3 million was recognized as a reduction to the debt obligation to Novartis.
As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance under this note agreement totaled $9.1 million.
Silicon Valley Bank Loan Agreement
In May 2018, we executed a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with SVB. Under the Loan Agreement, upon our request, SVB may make advances available to us of up to $20.0 million. We were able to borrow advances under the Term Loan from May 7, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) until the earlier of March 31, 2019 or an event of default. 
In March 2019, we and SVB amended the Loan Agreement to extend the draw period from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Our draw period lapsed on March 31, 2020 with no further extension. In connection with the amendment, we issued a second warrant to SVB, which is exercisable in whole or in part for up to an aggregate of 4,845 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $14.71 per share. 
In September 2018, we borrowed $7.5 million under the Loan Agreement in connection with the Agenus royalty purchase agreement. In June and September 2019, we borrowed advances of $3.0 million and $1.5 million for the upfront payment and the contingent consideration under the Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement, respectively. In September 2019, we borrowed an additional $5.0 million in connection with the Palo Royalty Purchase Agreement. 
As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the debt under the Loan Agreement was $12.2 million.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Some of the drugs our licensees or royalty partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our licensees’ or royalty partners’ competitors. There can be no assurance that developments by others, including, without limitation, the development of generics or biosimilars, will not render our, or our licensees’, products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
Additionally, our royalty aggregator model faces competition on at least two fronts. First, there are other companies, funds and other investment vehicles seeking to aggregate royalties or provide alternative financing to development-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The competitive companies, funds and other investment vehicles may have a lower target rate of return, a lower cost of capital or access to greater amounts of capital and thereby may be able to acquire assets that we are also targeting for acquisitions. Second, existing or potential competitors to our partners and licensees’ products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners and licensees, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. Development stage products in our portfolio require approval by the FDA before we will recognize any royalties from sales. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners.
We believe that there are no compliance issues with laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have adversely affected, or are reasonably expected to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures arising from environmental regulation. We believe that climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements and the risk of disruptions to our business. We do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time.
For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is important to our business and our future income streams will depend in part on our, and our partners and licensees’, ability to obtain issued patents and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent

and Trademark Office with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our, or our partners or licensees’ patents will afford protection against competitors with similar products or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patent applications. Below is a list of representative patents and patent applications related to our licensed programs:

If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our partners and licensees may require certain licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms.
We protect our proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and partners. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that we or our consultants or partners use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our consultants or partners or other third parties, as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Concentration of Risk
Our business model is dependent on third parties achieving specified development milestones and product sales. Our pipeline currently includes over 65 fully-funded programs from which we could potentially receive royalties or other payments if the programs achieve marketability. Novartis is developing several of the programs in our pipeline. While we do not expect the discontinuation of any one program would have a material impact on our business, the discontinuation of all programs by Novartis could have a material effect on our business and financial condition.
Organization
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation. When referring to a time or period before December 31, 1998 or after December 31, 2011, the terms “Company” and “XOMA” refer to XOMA Corporation, a Delaware corporation; when referring to a time or period between December 31, 1998 and December 31, 2011, such terms refer to XOMA Ltd., a Bermuda company.
Our principal executive offices are located at 2200 Powell Street, Suite 310, Emeryville, California 94608. Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is (510) 204-7200. Our website address is www.xoma.com. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Human Capital Resources
We rely on a small number of skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. As of March 5, 2021, we employed 10 full-time employees primarily engaged in executive, business development, legal, finance and administrative positions.

The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, broad-based equity awards, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others. These benefits provide our employees choices where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families, as well as access to tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors to improve their physical and mental health. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and “shelter in place” and similar orders issued by state and local governments, we have temporarily restricted access to our office in California, as well as suspended any non-essential business travel. Our employees are conducting their work remotely, and they otherwise have minimal presence in our offices for essential activities. The safety, health and well-being of our employees is paramount. As such, we will consider ongoing government regulations and local health conditions before lifting any restrictions on travel or allowing any gatherings at our offices.
