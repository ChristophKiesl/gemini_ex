Industry Overview



Over the years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the automobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. China has relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been implementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditional fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. We believe China is the most prospective market for pure electric vehicles. We also believe that in the global automobile industry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicle and core parts industry in the future.



In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, was first found in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the global economy and many industries, including the automobile and parts industry. However, as the outbreak in China has been gradually managed under control, the automobile and parts industry has also resumed productions. Stimulated by the various preferential policies of the Chinese government to promote economic development, we believe the automobile and its parts industry will return onto the track for the next development.



As one of the pioneers in China’s electric vehicle industry, Kandi has spent years in the innovation of the new energy vehicle technology research and development, production layout and market promotion mode, Kandi has successfully taken its position in China’s electric vehicle industry, especially in the areas of the production and manufacturing of electric vehicles and core parts.



Competitive Landscape



In general, our EV business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.



In terms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric vehicle manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV industry in China.



On March 31, 2020, in order to promote automobile consumption, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to extend two preferential policies of new energy vehicle purchase subsidy and vehicle purchase tax exemption for another two years, which were originally due at the end 2020. The Chinese government has released various national policies to promote the high-quality development of the electric vehicle industry with goals to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry, to improve the comprehensive competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry, to support the electric vehicle and its core parts industry, to accelerate the resumption of production, and to promote the automobile consumption to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on the national economy.



Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy



Local governments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource dependence. As one of the beneficiaries of the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandi has become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience.



Our business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Car- Share Program. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors.



Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most popular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the online ride-sharing service (“ORSS”) program.

In order to create an ecosphere of EV changing-battery-model, on October 22, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic agreement with Zhejiang State Grid Electric Vehicle Service Company. The two parties will cooperate extensively across the whole supply chain for electric vehicle-battery exchange. This in-depth collaboration will focus on the following areas: centralized constant temperature battery charging, distribution, maintenance, battery recycling, construction and operation of power exchange networks, power exchange services to meet energy demand, grid auxiliary services, flexible control of power load exchange, as well as other value-added services for power exchange stations. The two parties will first start their collaboration in the project of “300,000 government-accredited ride-sharing vehicles within 5 years” (the “Online Ride-Sharing Project”) initiated by Kandi, and then expand into new areas of cooperation based on the progress in this collaboration. In October 22, 2020, the Company established Zhejiang Ruiheng Technology Company with Zhejiang Ruibo New Energy Vehicle Service Company Ltd. and Jiangsu Jinpeng Group Ltd. The Online Ride-Sharing Project will be undertaken by Zhejiang Ruiheng. One of the special points of the Online Ride-Sharing Project is that all the cars in this project will use the changing-battery-model. The changing-battery-model is able to solve problems such as high price of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential pollution problems and so on. Furthermore this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which prolongs the usage life of the battery and truly realize green energy efficiency. We believe that this upgrade to ORSS program from MPT (“Micro Public Transportation”) advocated and practiced by Kandi will become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of EV changing-battery-model ecosphere.




SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”) is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in the wholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from off-road vehicle parts wholesale and retail. It has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. To gain access to and promote electric vehicle products to the U.S. market, on July 1, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports. During 2020, the Company received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models – the K23 and K27 – via Certificates of Conformity.

Product Safety and Regulation



Safety Regulation



The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi’s products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and regulates the safety of electric vehicles for road vehicles.



In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “Product Safety Act”) was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (“ANSI/SVIA”) safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Both Kandi and SC Autosports currently comply with the ANSI/SVIA standard.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally.



The Company has received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models, the K23 and K27 via Certificates of Conformity.
