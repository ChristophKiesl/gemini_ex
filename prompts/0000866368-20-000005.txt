The Company

PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, flex and office space. Substantially all of PSB’s assets are held, and its business is conducted, through PS Business Parks, L.P. (the “OP”), a California limited partnership. PSB has full, exclusive, and complete control of the OP as the sole general partner and, as of December 31, 2019, owned 79.0% of the common partnership units, with Public Storage (“PS”) owning the remainder. PS also owns 7.2 million common shares and assuming issuance of PSB common stock upon redemption of the common partnership units held by PS, PS would own 41.6% (or 14.5 million shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references mean PS Business Parks, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the OP and our consolidated joint venture. 

As of December 31, 2019, we owned and operated 27.6 million rentable square feet of commercial space, comprising 97 business parks, in California, Texas, Virginia, Florida, Maryland and Washington. The Company focuses on owning concentrated business parks which provide the Company with the greatest flexibility to meet the needs of its customers. Along with the commercial space, we also have a 95.0% interest in a 395-unit apartment complex. The Company also manages 438,000 rentable square feet on behalf of PS.

History of the Company: The Company was formed in 1990 as a California corporation. Through a series of transactions between January, 1997 and March, 1998, the Company was renamed “PS Business Parks, Inc.” and became a publicly held, fully integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT having interests in commercial real estate held through our OP.

Principal Business Activities

We are in the commercial property business, with 97 business parks consisting of multi-tenant industrial, flex and office space. The Company owns 18.1 million square feet of industrial space that has characteristics similar to the warehouse component of the flex space as well as ample dock access. We own 6.2 million square feet of flex space, representing industrial buildings that are configured with a combination of warehouse and office space and can be designed to fit a wide variety of uses. The warehouse component of the flex space has a number of uses including light manufacturing and assembly, storage and warehousing, showroom, laboratory, distribution and research and development activities. The office component of flex space is complementary to the warehouse component by enabling businesses to accommodate management and production staff in the same facility. In addition, the Company 

 

owns 3.2 million square feet of low-rise office space, generally either in business parks that combine office and flex space or in submarkets where the market demand is more office focused.

We generally seek to own and operate multi-tenant buildings in multi-building business parks which accommodate various businesses and uses. Our business parks average 14 buildings and 800,000 rentable square feet per park, located on parcels of various sizes, ranging from one to 49 buildings and 12,000 to 3.5 million square feet of rentable space. Parking is generally open but in some instances is covered. The ratio of parking spaces to rentable square feet generally ranges from two to six per thousand square feet depending upon the use of the property and its location. Office space generally requires a greater parking ratio than most industrial uses. 

The customer base for our facilities is diverse. The portfolio can be bifurcated into those facilities that service small to medium-sized businesses and those that service larger businesses. Approximately 36.8% of in-place rents from the portfolio are derived from facilities that generally serve small to medium-sized businesses. A property in this facility type is typically divided into units under 5,000 square feet and leases generally range from one to three years. The remaining 63.2% of in-place rents from the portfolio are generally derived from facilities that serve larger businesses, with units 5,000 square feet and larger. The Company also has several customers that lease space in multiple buildings and locations. As of December 31, 2019, the U.S. Government is the largest customer with multiple leases encompassing approximately 521,000 square feet and 3.1% of the Company’s annualized rental income. 

We operate in six states and we may expand our operations to other states or reduce the number of states in which we operate. However, we have no current plans to expand into additional markets or exit existing markets. Properties are acquired for both income and capital appreciation potential; we place no limitation on the amount that can be invested in any specific property. 

The Company owns approximately 14.0 acres and 6.4 acres of land in Dallas and Northern Virginia, respectively, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as land and building held for development. The Company will seek to develop these parcels and possibly seek redevelopment of other assets in the future.

Recent Company Developments 

Acquisition of Real Estate Facilities: Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial park comprised of approximately 73,000 rentable square feet in La Mirada, California, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of five buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet. 

On December 20, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant flex park comprised of approximately 79,000 rentable square feet in Santa Clara, California, for a total purchase price of $16.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of nine buildings and was 95.6% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 200 to 3,500 square feet. 

On September 5, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial park comprised of approximately 543,000 rentable square feet in Santa Fe Springs, California, for a total purchase price of $104.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of ten buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 5,000 to 288,000 square feet. 

On April 18, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial park comprised of approximately 74,000 rentable square feet in Signal Hill, California, for a total purchase price of $13.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of eight buildings and was 98.4% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 8,000 square feet. The eight buildings are located in the Signal Hill industrial submarket where we already own five industrial parks totaling 268,000 square feet. 



Development of Multifamily Real Estate: In 2019, we successfully rezoned our 628,000 square foot office park known as The Mile in Tysons, Virginia. The rezoning will allow us to develop, at our election, up to 3,000 additional multifamily units and approximately 500,000 square feet of other commercial uses. We leveraged the expertise of a well-regarded local developer and operator of multifamily real estate to develop our first multifamily development at The Mile which completed in 2017, a 395-unit multifamily property known as Highgate. We are currently seeking to demolish a 123,000 square foot vacant office building in order to construct our second multifamily property, for which we will likely enter into a similar joint venture with the same well-regarded local developer. There could be several phases of the development at The Mile beyond that, but the scope, timing and construction of all future phases of development of The Mile are subject to a variety of contingencies, including site plan approvals and building permits. See “Objectives and Strategies” below for further information regarding our development and redevelopment activities.

Sales of Real Estate Facilities: On October 8, 2019, we sold three business parks located in Montgomery County, Maryland: Metro Park North, Meadow Business Park and WesTech Business Park. The parks, consisting of 28 buildings totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet, sold for net sale proceeds of $144.6 million, which resulted in a gain of $16.6 million.

Also subsequent to December 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of a single-tenant building totaling 113,000 square feet in Montgomery County, Maryland, for a gross sales price of $30.0 million. The building had been marketed previously as part of a broader portfolio of suburban Maryland office properties sold in 2019, but was excluded from the 1.3 million square foot sale which closed October 8, 2019 and as such was the Company’s only remaining office asset at Metro Park North.


Tax and Corporate Structure

For all periods presented herein, we have elected REIT status under the Code. As a REIT, we generally do not incur federal income tax if we distribute substantially all of our “REIT taxable income” (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) each year, and if we meet certain organizational and operational requirements. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the “REIT taxable income” that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT. 

PSB is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), with substantially all of our activities conducted through the OP. We acquired interests in certain properties from PS during PSB’s initial formation in exchange for operating partnership units, which allowed PS to defer the recognition of a tax gain on the contributed properties. We have the ability to offer similar tax-efficient transactions to potential sellers of real estate in the future. 

We are the sole general partner of the OP, which has equity in the form of common partnership units and preferred partnership units that are identical as to terms, coupon rates, and liquidation amounts as our preferred shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 79.0% of the common partnership units of the OP and 100% of the preferred partnership units. The remainder of the common partnership units are owned by PS. The common units owned by PS may be redeemed, subject to certain limitations, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, an equivalent value in cash. 

The Company’s interest in the OP entitles it to share in cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the OP in proportion to the Company’s economic interest in the OP (apart from tax allocations of profits and losses to take into account pre-contribution property appreciation or depreciation). The Company, since 1998, has paid per share dividends on its common and preferred stock that track, on a one-for-one basis, the amount of per unit cash distributions the Company receives from the OP in respect of the common and preferred partnership units in the OP that are owned by the Company. 

As the general partner of the OP, the Company has the exclusive responsibility under the Operating Partnership Agreement to manage and conduct the business of the OP. The OP is responsible for, and pays when due, its share of all administrative and operating expenses of the properties it owns.

Common Officers and Directors with PS

Ronald L. Havner, Jr., Chairman of the Company, is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of PS. Joseph D. Russell, Jr. is a director of the Company and also President and Chief Executive Officer of PS. Gary E. Pruitt, an independent director of the Company, is also a trustee of PS. Other employees of PS render services to the Company pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services agreement.

 

Services Provided to and by PS

We manage industrial, office, and retail facilities in the United States for PS under either the “Public Storage” or “PS Business Parks” names (the “PS Management Agreement”). Under PS’s supervision, we coordinate and assist in rental and marketing activities, property maintenance and other operational activities, including the selection of vendors, suppliers, employees and independent contractors. Management fee revenue derived from the PS Management Agreement totaled $287,000, $407,000 and $506,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are included in “interest and other income” on our consolidated statements of income

PS also provides property management services for the self-storage component of two assets owned by the Company. Management fee expenses under the contract were $98,000, $96,000 and $92,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are included under “cost of operations” on our consolidated statements of income.

Pursuant to a cost sharing agreement, we share certain administrative services, corporate office space, and certain other third party costs with PS which are allocated based upon fair and reasonable estimates of the cost of the services expected to be provided. We reimbursed PS $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for costs paid on our behalf, while PS reimbursed us $39,000, $38,000 and $31,000 for costs we incurred on their behalf for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Management

Maria R. Hawthorne, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, leads the Company’s senior management team. The Company’s senior management includes: John W. Petersen, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeffrey D. Hedges, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trenton A. Groves, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; Coby A. Holley, Vice President, Investments; Christopher M. Auth, Vice President (Washington Metro Division); Stuart H. Hutchison, Vice President (Southern California and Pacific Northwest Divisions); Richard E. Scott, Vice President (Northern California Division); David A. Vicars, Vice President (Texas Division); Rich Guertin, Vice President (Florida Division); and Eugene Uhlman, Vice President, Construction Management.

Competition

Our properties compete for tenants with similar properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. Competition in the market areas we operate in is significant and has from time to time negatively impacted occupancy levels and rental rates of, and increased the operating expenses of, certain of our properties. Competition may be accelerated by any increase in availability of funds for investment in real estate, because barriers to entry can be relatively low for those with the necessary capital. The demand for space in our markets is impacted by general economic conditions, which can affect the local competition for tenants. Sublease space and unleased developments have from time to time created competition among operators in certain markets in which the Company operates. We also compete for property acquisitions with entities that have greater financial resources than the Company. 

We believe we possess several distinguishing characteristics and strategies, some of which are described below under “Objectives and Strategies,” that enable us to compete effectively. In addition, we believe our personnel are among the most experienced in our real estate markets. The Company’s facilities are part of a comprehensive system encompassing standardized procedures and integrated reporting and information networks. 

We believe that the significant operating and financial experience of our executive officers and directors combined with the Company’s capital structure, national investment scope, geographic diversity, financial stability, and economies of scale should enable us to compete effectively.

Objectives and Strategies

Our primary objective is to grow shareholder value in a risk appropriate and stable manner by maximizing the net cash flow generated by our existing properties, as well as prudently seeking growth through acquisitions and development that generate attractive returns on invested capital. 

We seek to optimize the net cash flow of our existing properties by maximizing occupancy levels and rental rates, while minimizing capital expenditures and leasehold improvements. Below are the primary elements of our strategy:

 

Concentration in favorable markets: We believe that our properties generally are located in markets that have favorable characteristics such as above average population, job, and income growth, as well as high education levels. In addition, we believe our business parks are generally in higher barrier to entry markets that are close to critical infrastructure, middle to high income housing or universities and have easy access to major transportation arteries. We believe that these characteristics contribute to favorable cash flow stability and growth. 

Standard build outs and finishes: We generally seek to configure our rentable space with standard buildouts and finishes that meet the needs of a wide variety of tenants, minimizing the need for specialized and costly tenant improvements and enabling space to be “move-in ready” quickly upon vacancy. We believe this makes our space more attractive to potential tenants, allows tenants to move in more quickly and seamlessly, and reduces the cost of capital improvements, relative to real estate operators that offer specialized finishes or build outs. Also, such flexibility facilitates our ability to offer diverse sizes and configurations to meet potential customer’s needs, as well as to change space sizes for existing customers when their needs change. 

Large, Diverse Parks: Our business parks are generally concentrated in large complexes of diverse buildings, with a variety of available space sizes and configurations that we can offer to tenants. We believe that this allows us to attract a greater number of potential tenants to our parks and minimizes the loss of existing customers when their space requirements change. 

Smaller tenants and diverse tenant base with shorter-term leases: By concentrating on smaller spaces, we seek to reach a large number of smaller tenants in the market. We believe this focus gives us a competitive edge as most institutional owners focus on large users. Small users perceive more incremental value from the level of customer service that we offer. We also believe having smaller tenants improves our diversity of tenants across industries, which improves the stability of our cash flows. In addition, our lease term tends to be shorter, generally an average of three and a half years, which we believe allows us to more quickly capture increases in market rents in our high-growth markets. At December 31, 2019, our average suite size was approximately 5,000 rentable square feet, and no individual customer, other than the U.S. Government, represents more than 1% of our annualized rental income. 

Decentralized operating strategy: Our local market management is empowered, within a prescribed decision and metrics framework, to make many leasing rate, capital, and lease term decisions in a manner which we believe maximizes the return on investment on leasing transactions. We believe this decentralized approach allows us to be more nimble and efficient in our decision making, and more effectively price and market our space, relative to a more centralized approach. 

Superior Service to Customers: We seek to provide a superior level of service to our customers in order to maintain occupancy and increase rental rates, as well as minimize customer turnover. The Company’s property management offices are located on-site, helping the Company maintain its properties and providing customers with convenient access to management, while conveying a sense of quality, order and security. We believe that our personnel are among the most experienced and effective in the real estate industry in our markets. The Company has significant experience in acquiring properties managed by others and thereafter improving customer satisfaction, occupancy levels, retention rates and rental income by implementing established customer service programs. 

In addition, we seek to expand through acquisitions or development activities that generate attractive returns on invested capital, as follows:

Acquire facilities in targeted markets at prudent price levels: We have a disciplined capital allocation approach, seeking to purchase properties at prices that are not in excess of the cost to develop similar facilities, which we believe reduces our risk and maximizes long term returns. We seek generally to acquire in our existing markets, which we believe have favorable growth characteristics. We also believe acquiring in our existing markets leverages our operating efficiencies. We would consider expanding to additional markets with similar favorable characteristics of our existing markets, if we could acquire sufficient scale (generally at least 2 million rentable square feet); however, we have no current plans or immediate prospects to do so. 

Redevelop existing real estate facilities: Certain of our existing business parks were developed in or near areas that have been undergoing gentrification and an influx of residential development, and, as a result, certain buildings in our business parks may have higher and better uses as residential space. While residential space is generally not a core asset class for us, we will seek to identify potential candidates for redevelopment in our portfolio, and plan to leverage the expertise and scale of existing operators and developers should we pursue redevelopment of any of our properties. For example, at The Mile in Tysons, Virginia, we demolished an existing building and developed Highgate, a 395-unit apartment building, with a joint venture partner. We also have successfully rezoned our 628,000 square foot office 
‎


park located within The Mile and are able to pursue the development of additional multifamily and mixed use projects. There can be no assurance as to the level of conversion opportunities throughout our portfolio in the future.

Financing Strategy

Overview of financing strategy and sources of capital: As a REIT, we generally distribute substantially all of our “REIT taxable income” to our shareholders which, relative to a taxable C corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investment purposes. As a result, in order to expand our asset base, access to capital is important. 

Our financial profile is characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. Our credit profile and ratings enable us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital. We will seek to maintain our credit profile and ratings. 

Sources of capital available to us include retained cash flow, the issuance of preferred and common equity, the issuance of medium and long-term debt, joint venture financing, the sale of properties, and our revolving line of credit. 

Historically, we have financed our cash investment activities primarily with retained operating cash flow and the issuance of preferred equity. 

We select from the sources of capital available to us based upon relative cost, availability and the desire for leverage, nature of the investment opportunities for which the capital will be used, as well as intangible factors such as the impact of covenants in the case of debt. 

Retained Operating Cash Flow: Although we are required to generally distribute substantially all of our “REIT taxable income” to our shareholders, we have nonetheless been able to retain operating cash flow to the extent that our tax depreciation exceeds our maintenance capital expenditures. In recent years, we have retained approximately $40 to $60 million in operating cash flow per year. 

Preferred Equity: We view preferred equity as an important source of capital over the long term, because it reduces interest rate and refinancing risks as the dividend rate is fixed and there are no refinancing requirements. In addition, the consequences of defaulting on required preferred distributions are less severe than with debt. However, rates and market conditions for the issuance of preferred securities can be volatile or inefficient from time to time. The preferred shareholders may elect two additional directors if six quarterly distributions go unpaid, whether or not consecutive. As of December 31, 2019, we have $944.8 million in preferred securities outstanding with an average coupon rate of 5.10%.

Medium or long-term debt: We have broad powers to borrow in furtherance of our objectives. We may consider the public issuance or private placement of senior unsecured debt in the future in an effort to diversify our sources of capital. 

Common equity: We believe that the market for our common equity is liquid and, as a result, common equity is a viable potential source of capital. 

Tax advantaged equity: As noted above, we have the ability to offer common or preferred operating partnership units with economic characteristics that are similar to our common and preferred stock, but provide the seller the opportunity to defer the recognition of a tax gain. 

Credit Facility: We have a $250.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Credit Facility”), which we use as necessary as temporary financing, along with short-term bank loans, until we are able to raise longer-term capital. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on our Credit Facility and we had no short-term bank loans. 

Investments in Real Estate Facilities

As of December 31, 2019, the Company owned and operated 27.6 million rentable square feet comprised of 97 business parks in six states compared to 28.2 million rentable square feet comprised of 96 business parks in six states as of December 31, 2018. The Company also held a 95.0% interest in a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.



Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates

The Company’s Restated Bylaws provide that the Company may engage in transactions with affiliates provided that a purchase or sale transaction with an affiliate is (i) approved by a majority of the Company’s independent directors and (ii) fair to the Company based on an independent appraisal or fairness opinion.

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, the Company employed 155 individuals, comprised primarily of personnel engaged in property operations. 

Insurance

The Company believes that its properties are adequately insured. Facilities operated by the Company have historically been covered by comprehensive insurance, including fire, earthquake, wind damage and liability coverage from nationally recognized carriers, subject to customary deductibles. 
Environmental Matters

Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those regarding the discharge of material into the environment, has not had any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

Substantially all of the Company’s properties have received Phase I environmental reviews. Such reviews have not revealed, and management is not aware of, any probable or reasonably possible environmental costs that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets or results of operations, nor is the Company aware of any potentially material environmental liability. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information.
